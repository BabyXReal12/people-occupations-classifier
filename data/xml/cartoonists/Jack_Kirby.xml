'''Jack Kirby''' (born '''Jacob Kurtzberg'''; August 28, 1917&amp;nbsp;– February 6, 1994) was an American [[comics artist|comic book artist]], writer, and editor, widely regarded as one of the medium's major innovators and one of its most prolific and influential creators.  He grew up in New York City, and learned to draw cartoon figures by tracing characters from comic strips and editorial cartoons. He entered the nascent comics industry in the 1930s, drawing various comics features under different [[pen name]]s, including Jack Curtiss, before ultimately settling on Jack Kirby. In 1940, he and writer-editor [[Joe Simon]] created the highly successful [[superhero]] character [[Captain America]] for [[Timely Comics]], predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]]. During the 1940s, Kirby, regularly teamed with Simon, creating numerous characters for that company and for [[National Comics Publications]], later to become [[DC Comics]].

After serving in the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theater]] in [[World War II]], Kirby produced work for DC, [[Harvey Comics]], [[Hillman Periodicals]], and other publishers. At [[Crestwood Publications]], he and Simon created the genre of [[romance comics]] and later founded their own short-lived comic company, [[Mainline Publications]]. Kirby was involved in Timely's 1950s iteration, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], which in the next decade became Marvel. There, in the 1960s, Kirby and writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] co-created many of the company's major characters, including the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[X-Men]], and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. The Lee–Kirby titles garnered high sales and critical acclaim, but in 1970, feeling he had been treated unfairly, largely in the realm of authorship credit and creators' rights, Kirby left the company for rival DC.

At DC, Kirby created his [[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]] saga, which spanned several comics titles. While these series proved commercially unsuccessful and were canceled, the Fourth World's [[New Gods]] have continued as a significant part of the [[DC Universe]]. Kirby returned to Marvel briefly in the mid-to-late 1970s, then ventured into [[television animation]] and [[independent comics]]. In his later years, Kirby, who has been called "the [[William Blake]] of comics",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |authorlink=Grant Morrison |last=Morrison |first=Grant |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/23/grant-morrison-supergods-superheroes |title=My Supergods from the Age of the Superhero |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London, United Kingdom |date=July 23, 2011 |accessdate=July 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/631ItbHhI?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/jul/23/grant-morrison-supergods-superheroes |archivedate=November 7, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; began receiving great recognition in the mainstream press for his career accomplishments, and in 1987 he was one of the three inaugural inductees of the [[The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame]]. In 2017, Kirby was posthumously named a [[Disney Legend]] with Lee for their co-creations not only in the field of publishing, but also because those creations formed the basis for [[Walt Disney Company]]'s financially and critically successful media franchise; the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

Kirby was married to Rosalind Goldstein in 1942. They had four children, and remained married until his death from heart failure in 1994, at the age of 76. The [[Jack Kirby Awards]] and [[Jack Kirby Hall of Fame]] were named in his honor, and he is known as "'''The King'''" among comics fans for his many influential contributions to the medium.

==Early life (1917–1935)==
Jack Kirby was born '''Jacob Kurtzberg''' on August 28, 1917, at 147 [[Essex Street]] on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] in New York City, where he was raised.&lt;ref name=Kirbymuseum&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kirbymuseum.org/biography | first= Mark | last= Evanier | authorlink = Mark Evanier | first2=Steve| last2=Sherman | title = Jack Kirby Biography | publisher = Jack Kirby Museum &amp; Research Center | accessdate = February 24, 2012 | archivedate= September 17, 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130917070658/http://kirbymuseum.org/biography/ | deadurl = no|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, Rose (Bernstein) and Benjamin Kurtzberg,&lt;ref name=Kirbymuseum/&gt; were [[Austrian-Jewish]] immigrants, and his father earned a living as a [[Clothing|garment]] factory worker.&lt;ref name=hamilsue&gt;Hamilton, Sue L. ''Jack Kirby''. ABDO Group, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-59928-298-5}}, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth, Kirby desired to escape his neighborhood. He liked to draw, and sought out places he could learn more about art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink= Gerard Jones | last = Jones | first = Gerard | title = Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book | publisher = [[Basic Books]] | year = 2004 | isbn= 978-0-465-03657-8 | pages = 195–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially self-taught,&lt;ref name=markev34&gt;{{cite book|last=Mark Evanier|first= Mark|title=Kirby: King of Comics|publisher=[[Abrams Books|Abrams]]|year= 2008|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-8109-9447-8|page= 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby cited among his influences the [[comic strip]] artists [[Milton Caniff]], [[Hal Foster]], and [[Alex Raymond]], as well as such editorial cartoonists as [[Charles Henry Sykes|C.H. Sykes]], [[Jay Norwood Darling|"Ding" Darling]], and [[Rollin Kirby]].&lt;ref name=markev34 /&gt; He was rejected by [[the Educational Alliance]] because he drew "too fast with charcoal", according to Kirby. He later found an outlet for his skills by drawing cartoons for the newspaper of the Boys Brotherhood Republic, a "miniature city" on East 3rd Street where street kids ran their own government.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 14, Kirby enrolled at the [[Pratt Institute]] in [[Brooklyn]], leaving after a week. "I wasn't the kind of student that Pratt was looking for. They wanted people who would work on something forever. I didn't want to work on any project forever. I intended to get things done".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= 'I've Never Done Anything Halfheartedly'|journal= [[The Comics Journal]]|publisher = [[Fantagraphics Books]]|number= 134|date = February 1990|location= Seattle, Washington}} Reprinted in {{cite book|editor-last=George  |editor-first=Milo |title = The Comics Journal Library, Volume One: Jack Kirby | publisher = Fantagraphics Books| year = 2002|location= Seattle, Washington| isbn = 978-1-56097-466-6 | page = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--editor's name is Milo George--&gt;

==Entry into comics (1936–1940)==
[[File:Captainamerica1.jpg|thumb|right|''Captain America Comics'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d March 1941). Cover art by Kirby and [[Joe Simon]].&lt;!--credits per Jack Kirby Museum--&gt;]]
Kirby joined the Lincoln Newspaper Syndicate in 1936, working there on newspaper comic strips and on single-panel advice cartoons such as ''Your Health Comes First!!!'' (under the [[pseudonym]] '''Jack Curtiss'''). He remained until late 1939, when he began working for the movie [[animation]] company [[Fleischer Studios]] as an [[Inbetweening|inbetweener]] (an artist who fills in the action between major-movement frames) on ''[[Popeye the Sailor (animated cartoons)|Popeye]]'' cartoons. "I went from Lincoln to Fleischer," he recalled. "From Fleischer I had to get out in a hurry because I couldn't take that kind of thing," describing it as "a factory in a sense, like my father's factory. They were manufacturing pictures."&lt;ref name="cj"&gt;Interview, ''The Comics Journal'' #134, reprinted in George, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Around that time, the American comic book industry was booming. Kirby began writing and drawing for the comic-book packager [[Eisner &amp; Iger]], one of a handful of firms creating comics on demand for publishers. Through that company, Kirby did what he remembers as his first comic book work, for ''Wild Boy Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;Interview, ''The Nostalgia Journal'' #30, November 1976, reprinted in George, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This included such strips as the science fiction adventure "The Diary of Dr. Hayward" (under the pseudonym '''Curt Davis'''), the [[Western comics|Western]] crimefighter feature "Wilton of the West" (as '''Fred Sande'''), the [[swashbuckler]] adventure "The Count of Monte Cristo" (again as Jack Curtiss), and the humor features "Abdul Jones" (as '''Ted Grey''') and "Socko the Seadog" (as '''Teddy'''), all variously for ''[[Jumbo Comics]]'' and other Eisner-Iger clients.&lt;ref name=gcdjack&gt;[https://www.comics.org/credit/name/Jack%20Kirby/sort/chrono/ Jack Kirby] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; He first used the surname Kirby as the pseudonymous '''Lance Kirby''' in two "Lone Rider" Western stories in [[Eastern Color Printing]]'s ''[[Famous Funnies]]'' #63–64 (Oct.–Nov. 1939).&lt;ref name=gcdjack /&gt; He ultimately settled on the pen name Jack Kirby because it reminded him of actor [[James Cagney]]. However, he took offense to those who suggested he changed his name in order to hide his Jewish heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnership with Joe Simon==
Kirby moved on to comic-book publisher and newspaper syndicator [[Fox Feature Syndicate]], earning a then-reasonable $15-a-week salary. He began to explore superhero narrative with the comic strip ''The [[Blue Beetle]]'', published  from January to March 1940, starring a character created by the pseudonymous [[Charles Nicholas (comics)|Charles Nicholas]], a house name that Kirby retained for the three-month-long strip. During this time, Kirby met and began collaborating with cartoonist and Fox editor [[Joe Simon]], who in addition to his staff work continued to freelance. Simon recalled in 1988, "I loved Jack's work and the first time I saw it I couldn't believe what I was seeing. He asked if we could do some freelance work together. I was delighted and I took him over to my little office. We worked from the second issue of [[Blue Bolt]] through... about 25 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.twomorrows.com/kirby/articles/25simon.html |title=More Than Your Average Joe - Excerpts from Joe Simon's panels at the 1998 San Diego Comic-Con International |journal=The Jack Kirby Collector |number=25 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=August 1999 |location=Raleigh, North Carolina |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uDqMcZsn?url=http://www.twomorrows.com/kirby/articles/25simon.html |archivedate=November 14, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beck]]'s drawing style,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/simonandkirby/archives/4162|title=In the Beginning, Chapter 10, Captain Marvel and Others|first=Harry|last=Mendryk|date=November 19, 2011|accessdate=May 29, 2018|archivedate=May 29, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180529232146/http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/simonandkirby/archives/4162|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the duo were hired on staff at [[pulp magazine]] publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]]'s [[Timely Comics]] (later to become Marvel Comics). There Simon and Kirby created the patriotic superhero [[Captain America]] in late 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1940s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 18|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Simon and Kirby decided to create another hero who was their response to totalitarian tyranny abroad.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon, who became the company's editor, with Kirby as art director, said he negotiated with Goodman to give the duo 25 percent of the profits from the feature.&lt;ref name="Ro"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ro|first= Ronin|title= Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution|publisher= [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury USA]]| year= 2004| page =25| isbn=978-1-58234-345-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of ''Captain America Comics'', released in early 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.toonopedia.com/capamer.htm|title= Captain America|first= Don|last= Markstein|year= 2010|publisher= [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]|accessdate= April 9, 2012|quote= Captain America was the first successful character published by the company that would become Marvel Comics to debut in his own comic. ''Captain America Comics'' #1 was dated March, 1941.}}&lt;/ref&gt; sold out in days, and the second issue's print run was set at over a million copies. The title's success established the team as a notable creative force in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; After the first issue was published, Simon asked Kirby to join the Timely staff as the company's art director.&lt;ref&gt;Ro, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

With the success of the Captain America character, Simon said he felt that Goodman was not paying the pair the promised percentage of profits, and so sought work for the two of them at [[National Comics Publications]] (later renamed [[DC Comics]]).&lt;ref name="Ro" /&gt; Kirby and Simon negotiated a deal that would pay them a combined $500 a week, as opposed to the $75 and $85 they respectively earned at Timely.&lt;ref&gt;Ro, p. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; The pair feared Goodman would not pay them if he found they were moving to National, but many people knew of their plan, including Timely editorial assistant [[Stan Lee]].&lt;ref name=rop27&gt;Ro, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; When Goodman eventually discovered it, he told Simon and Kirby to leave after finishing work on ''Captain America Comics'' #10.&lt;ref name=rop27 /&gt;

Kirby and Simon spent their first weeks at National trying to devise new characters while the company sought how best to utilize the pair.&lt;ref&gt;Ro, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; After a few failed editor-assigned ghosting assignments, National's [[Jack Liebowitz]] told them to "just do what you want". The pair then revamped the [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)|Sandman]] feature in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' and created the superhero [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]].&lt;ref&gt;Ro, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first= Daniel|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1940s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 41 |quote = Hot properties Joe Simon and Jack Kirby joined DC...[and] after taking over the Sandman and Sandy, the Golden Boy feature in ''Adventure Comics'' #72, the writer and artist team turned their attentions to Manhunter with issue #73.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1942 they began the ''[[Boy Commandos]]'' feature. The ongoing "kid gang" series of the same name, launched later that same year, was the creative team's first National feature to graduate into its own title.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace "1940s" in Dolan, p. 41 "The inaugural issue of ''Boy Commandos'' represented Joe Simon and Jack Kirby's first original title since they started at DC (though the characters had debuted earlier that year in ''Detective Comics'' #64.)"&lt;/ref&gt; It sold over a million copies a month, becoming National's third best-selling title.&lt;ref name="Ro, p. 32"&gt;Ro, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; They scored a hit with the homefront kid-gang team, the [[Newsboy Legion]], featuring in ''[[Star-Spangled Comics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace "1940s" in Dolan, p. 41 "Joe Simon and Jack Kirby took their talents to a second title with ''Star-Spangled Comics'', tackling both the Guardian and the Newsboy Legion in issue #7."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that "Like Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the creative team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby was a mark of quality and a proven track record."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Paul Levitz|last=Levitz|first= Paul|chapter= The Golden Age 1938–1956|title= 75 Years of DC Comics The Art of Modern Mythmaking|publisher= [[Taschen]]|year=2010|location= Cologne, Germany|ISBN= 9783836519816|page= 131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II (1943–1945)==
With World War II underway, Liebowitz expected that Simon and Kirby would be [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]], so he asked the artists to create an inventory of material to be published in their absence. The pair hired writers, inkers, letterers, and colorists in order to create a year's worth of material.&lt;ref name="Ro, p. 32"/&gt; Kirby was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] on June 7, 1943.&lt;ref name=ro33&gt;Ro, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; After basic training at [[Camp Stewart]], near Savannah, Georgia, he was assigned to Company F of the [[11th Infantry Regiment (United States)|11th Infantry Regiment]].&lt;ref name=markeve67&gt;Evanier, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; He landed on [[Omaha Beach]] in [[Normandy]] on August 23, 1944, two-and-a-half months after [[D-Day]],&lt;ref name=markeve67 /&gt; although Kirby's reminiscences would place his arrival just 10 days after.&lt;ref name="ro33"/&gt; Kirby recalled that a lieutenant, learning that comics artist Kirby was in his command, made him a scout who would advance into towns and draw [[reconnaissance]] maps and pictures, an extremely dangerous duty.&lt;ref&gt;Ro, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar career (1946–1955)==
[[File:Young Romance Issue 1.jpg|thumb|''Young Romance'' #1 (Oct. 1947). Cover art by Kirby and [[Joe Simon|Simon]].]]
After the war, Simon arranged work for Kirby and himself at [[Harvey Comics]],&lt;ref&gt;Ro, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; where, through the early 1950s, the duo created such titles as the kid-gang adventure ''Boy Explorers Comics'', the kid-gang [[Western comics|Western]] ''[[Boys' Ranch]]'', the superhero comic ''Stuntman'', and, in vogue with the fad for [[3D film|3-D movies]], ''[[Captain 3-D]]''. Simon and Kirby additionally freelanced for [[Hillman Periodicals]] (the [[crime fiction]] comic ''Real Clue Crime'') and for [[Crestwood Publications]] (''[[Justice Traps the Guilty]]'').&lt;ref name=gcdjack /&gt;

The team found its greatest success in the postwar period by creating [[romance comics]]. Simon, inspired by [[Macfadden Publications]]' romantic-confession magazine ''True Story'', transplanted the idea to comic books and with Kirby created a first-issue mock-up of ''[[Young Romance]]''.&lt;ref name="joesimon123-125"&gt;Simon, Joe, with Jim Simon. ''The Comic Book Makers'' (Crestwood/II, 1990) {{ISBN|978-1-887591-35-5}}; reissued (Vanguard Productions, 2003) {{ISBN|978-1-887591-35-5}}, pp. 123-125&lt;/ref&gt; Showing it to Crestwood general manager Maurice Rosenfeld, Simon asked for 50% of the comic's profits. Crestwood publishers Teddy Epstein and Mike Bleier agreed,&lt;ref name="joesimon123-125" /&gt; stipulating that the creators would take no money up front.&lt;ref&gt;Evanier, ''King of Comics''. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; ''Young Romance'' #1 (cover-date Oct. 1947) "became Jack and Joe's biggest hit in years".&lt;ref name=ro46&gt;Ro, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The pioneering title sold a staggering 92% of its print run, inspiring Crestwood to increase the print run by the third issue to triple the initial number of copies.&lt;ref name="Real Love"&gt;{{cite book|last= Howell|first= Richard|authorlink= Richard Howell (comics)|chapter= Introduction|title = Real Love: The Best of the Simon and Kirby Love Comics, 1940s-1950s|publisher= Eclipse Books|year= 1988|location=Forestville, California|isbn = 978-0913035634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially published bimonthly, ''Young Romance'' quickly became a monthly title and produced the spin-off ''[[Young Love (comics)|Young Love]]''—together the two titles sold two million copies per month, according to Simon&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;—later joined by ''Young Brides'' and ''In Love'', the latter "featuring full-length romance stories".&lt;ref name="Real Love" /&gt; ''Young Romance'' spawned dozens of imitators from publishers such as Timely, [[Fawcett Comics|Fawcett]], [[Quality Comics|Quality]], and [[Fox Feature Syndicate]].&lt;ref name=ro46/&gt; Despite the glut, the Simon and Kirby romance titles continued to sell millions of copies a month.&lt;ref name=ro46/&gt;

The partnership between Kirby and Simon had become strained.&lt;ref&gt;Ro, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Simon left the industry for a career in advertising, while Kirby continued to freelance. "He wanted to do other things and I stuck with comics," Kirby recalled in 1971. "It was fine.

At this point in the mid-1950s, Kirby made a temporary return to the former [[Timely Comics]], now known as Atlas Comics, the direct predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]]. Inker [[Frank Giacoia]] had approached editor-in-chief Stan Lee for work and suggested he could "get Kirby back here to pencil some stuff."&lt;ref name="ro60"&gt;Ro, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; While freelancing for National Comics Publications, the future [[DC Comics]], Kirby drew 20 stories for Atlas from 1956 to 1957: Beginning with the five-page "Mine Field" in ''Battleground'' #14 (Nov 1956), Kirby penciled and in some cases inked (with his wife, [[Jack Kirby#Personal life|Roz]]) and wrote stories of the [[Western comics|Western]] hero [[Black Rider (comics)|Black Rider]], the [[Fu Manchu]]-like [[Yellow Claw]], and more.&lt;ref name=gcdjack /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirby's 1956-57 Atlas work appeared in nine issues, plus three more published later after being held in inventory, per {{cite web|url=http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/simonandkirby/archives/1086 |title=Another Pre-Implosion Atlas Kirby |publisher=Jack Kirby Museum |date=November 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709112725/http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/simonandkirby/archives/1086 |archivedate=July 9, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }} In roughly chronological order: ''Battleground'' #14 (Nov. 1956; 5 pp.), ''Astonishing'' #56 (Dec. 1956; 4 pp.), ''Strange Tales of the Unusual'' #7 (Dec. 1956; 4 pp.), ''Quick-Trigger Western'' #16 (Feb. 1957; 5 pp.), ''[[Yellow Claw]]'' #2-4 (Dec. 1956 - April 1957; 19 pp. each), ''Black Rider Rides Again'' #1, a.k.a. ''Black Rider'' vol. 2, #1 (Sept. 1957; 19 pp.), and ''Two Gun Western'' #12 (Sept. 1957; 5 pp.), plus the inventoried ''[[Gunsmoke Western]]'' #47 (July 1958; 4 pp.) and #51 (March 1959; 5 pp. plus cover) and ''[[Kid Colt|Kid Colt Outlaw]]'' #86 (Sept. 1959; 5 pp.)&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1957, distribution troubles caused the "Atlas implosion" that resulted in several series being dropped and no new material being assigned for many months. It would be the following year before Kirby returned to the nascent Marvel.

For DC around this time, Kirby co-created with writers Dick and Dave Wood the non-superpowered adventuring quartet the [[Challengers of the Unknown]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #6 (Feb. 1957),&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander C. Irvine|Irvine, Alex]] "1950s" in Dolan, p. 84: "Kirby's first solo project was a test run of a non-super hero adventure team called Challengers of the Unknown. Appearing for the first time in ''Showcase'' #6, the team would make a few more ''Showcase'' appearances before springing into their own title in May 1958."&lt;/ref&gt; while contributing to such anthologies as ''[[House of Mystery]]''.&lt;ref name=gcdjack /&gt; During 30 months freelancing for DC, Kirby drew slightly more than 600 pages, which included 11 six-page [[Green Arrow]] stories in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' and ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' that, in a rarity, Kirby inked himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Evanier|first= Mark|authorlink= Mark Evanier|chapter= Introduction|title= The Green Arrow|publisher= DC Comics|year= 2001|location= New York, New York|isbn= |quote= All were inked by Jack with the aid of his dear spouse, Rosalind.

(Jack hated inking and only did it because he needed the money. After departing DC this time, he almost never inked his own work again.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby recast the archer as a science-fiction hero, moving him away from his Batman-formula roots, but in the process alienating Green Arrow co-creator [[Mort Weisinger]].&lt;ref name="ro61"&gt;Ro, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

He began drawing ''[[Sky Masters of the Space Force]],'' a newspaper comic strip, written by the Wood brothers and initially inked by the unrelated [[Wally Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;Evanier, ''King of Comics,'' pp. 103-106: "The artwork was exquisite, in no small part because Dave Wood had the idea to hire Wally Wood (no relation) to handle the inking."&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby left National Comics Publications due largely to a contractual dispute in which editor [[Jack Schiff]], who had been involved in getting Kirby and the Wood brothers the ''Sky Masters'' contract, claimed he was due royalties from Kirby's share of the strip's profits. Schiff successfully sued Kirby.&lt;ref&gt;Evanier, ''King of Comics'', p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Some DC editors had criticized him over art details, such as not drawing "the shoelaces on a cavalryman's boots" and showing a Native American "mounting his horse from the wrong side."&lt;ref&gt;Ro, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months later, after his split with DC, Kirby began freelancing regularly for Atlas despite harboring negative sentiments about Lee (the cousin of Timely publisher Martin Goodman's wife), whom Kirby believed had disclosed to Timely back in the 1940s that he and Simon were secretly working on a project for National.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Comic Book History of Comics|last1=Van Lente|first1=Fred|last2=Dunlavey|first2=Ryan|publisher=[[IDW Publishing]]|year=2012|isbn=978-1613771976|location=San Diego, California|pages=46–49, 100|authorlink=Fred Van Lente}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the poor page rates, Kirby would spend 12 to 14 hours daily at his drawing table at home, producing four to five pages of artwork a day.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; His first published work at Atlas was the cover of and the seven-page story "I Discovered the Secret of the Flying Saucers" in ''[[Strange Worlds]]'' #1 (Dec. 1958). Initially with [[Christopher Rule]] as his regular inker, and later [[Dick Ayers]], Kirby drew across all genres, from romance comics to war comics to crime comics to Western comics, but made his mark primarily with a series of supernatural-fantasy and science fiction stories featuring giant, [[drive-in movie]]-style monsters with names like [[Groot]], the Thing from Planet X;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/groottta.htm|title= Groot|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= March 10, 2011|publisher= Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131113231254/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/groottta.htm|archivedate= November 13, 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grottu, King of the Insects;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/grottu.htm|title= Grottu|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= January 17, 2007|publisher= Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131113221123/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/grottu.htm|archivedate= November 13, 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fin Fang Foom]] for the company's many anthology series, such as ''[[Amazing Adventures]],'' ''[[Strange Tales]],'' ''[[Tales to Astonish]],'' ''[[Tales of Suspense]],'' and ''[[World of Fantasy]].''&lt;ref name=gcdjack /&gt; His bizarre designs of powerful, unearthly creatures proved a hit with readers.

It was at Marvel, in collaborating with writer and editor-in-chief Lee that Kirby hit his stride once again in superhero comics, beginning with ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]'' #1 (Nov. 1961).&lt;ref name=gcdjack /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 84: "It did not take long for editor Stan Lee to realize that ''The Fantastic Four'' was a hit...the flurry of fan letters all pointed to the FF's explosive popularity."&lt;/ref&gt; The landmark series became a hit that revolutionized the industry with its comparative [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]] and, eventually, a cosmic purview informed by Kirby's seemingly boundless imagination{{mdash}}one well-matched with the consciousness-expanding [[youth culture]] of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="century"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Krensky|first= Stephen|title= Comic Book Century: The History of American Comic Books| publisher= [[Lerner Publishing Group|Twenty-First Century Books]]|year= 2007|location= Minneapolis, Minnesota|page= 59|isbn=978-0-8225-6654-0| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=n23M0Bn0JmwC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=%22fantastic+four%22|quote=Readers...liked seeing Reed and Sue bicker, Johnny annoying everyone, and Ben being grumpy....

The close bonds shared with youth culture meant that superheroes had reasserted themselves into the American national consciousness.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For almost a decade, Kirby provided Marvel's house style, co-creating with Stan Lee many of the Marvel characters and designing their visual motifs. At Lee's request, he often provided new-to-Marvel artists "breakdown" layouts, over which they would pencil in order to become acquainted with the Marvel look. As artist [[Gil Kane]] described:
{{quote|text=Jack was the single most influential figure in the turnaround in Marvel's fortunes from the time he rejoined the company...It wasn't merely that Jack conceived most of the characters that are being done, but...Jack's point of view and philosophy of drawing became the governing philosophy of the entire publishing company and, beyond the publishing company, of the entire field...[Marvel took] Jack and use[d] him as a primer. They would get artists...and they taught them the ABCs, which amounted to learning Jack Kirby... Jack was like the Holy Scripture and they simply had to follow him without deviation. That's what was told to me ... It was how they taught everyone to reconcile all those opposing attitudes to one single master point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Gil Kane, speaking at a forum on July 6, 1985, at the Dallas Fantasy Fair. As quoted in George, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1968 and 1969, Joe Simon was involved in litigation with Marvel Comics over the ownership of Captain America, initiated by Marvel after Simon registered the copyright renewal for Captain America in his own name. According to Simon, Kirby agreed to support the company in the litigation and, as part of a deal Kirby made with publisher Martin Goodman, signed over to Marvel any rights he might have had to the character.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

At this same time, Kirby grew increasingly dissatisfied with working at Marvel, for reasons Kirby biographer Mark Evanier has suggested include resentment over Lee's media prominence, a lack of full creative control, anger over breaches of perceived promises by publisher Martin Goodman, and frustration over Marvel's failure to credit him specifically for his story plotting and for his character creations and co-creations.&lt;ref&gt;Evanier, ''King of Comics'', p. 126-163&lt;/ref&gt; He began to both write and draw some secondary features for Marvel, such as "The Inhumans" in [[Amazing Adventures#1970 series|''Amazing Adventures'' volume two]],&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 146: "As Marvel was expanding its line of comics, the company decided to introduce two new 'split' books...''Amazing Adventures'' and ''Astonishing Tales''. ''Amazing Adventures'' contained a series about the genetically enhanced Inhumans and a series about intelligence agent the Black Widow."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as horror stories for the anthology title ''[[Chamber of Darkness]],'' and received full credit for doing so; but in 1970, Kirby was presented with a contract that included such unfavorable terms as a prohibition against legal retaliation. When Kirby objected, the management refused to negotiate any contract changes.&lt;ref&gt;Evanier, ''King of Comics'', p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby, although he was earning $35,000 a year freelancing for the company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/02/archives/shazam-here-comes-captain-relevant-here-comes-captain-relevant.html?scp=27|title=Shazam!

==DC Comics and the Fourth World saga (1971–1975)==

Kirby spent nearly two years negotiating a deal to move to DC Comics,&lt;ref&gt;Ro, p.139&lt;/ref&gt; where in late 1970 he signed a three-year contract with an option for two additional years.&lt;ref&gt;Ro, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; He produced a series of interlinked titles under the blanket [[sobriquet]] "[[Fourth World (comics)|The Fourth World]]", which included a trilogy of new titles&amp;nbsp;— ''[[New Gods]],'' ''[[Mister Miracle]],'' and ''[[The Forever People]]''&amp;nbsp;— as well as the extant ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]].''&lt;ref name=gcdjack /&gt;&lt;ref name=CBHistoryOfComics/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie, Michael "1970s" in Dolan, p. 145 "As the writer, artist, and editor of the Fourth World family of interlocking titles, each of which possessed its own distinct tone and theme, Jack Kirby cemented his legacy as a pioneer of grand-scale storytelling."&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby picked the latter book because the series was without a stable creative team and he did not want to cost anyone a job.&lt;ref&gt;Evanier, Mark. "Afterword." ''Jack Kirby's Fourth World Omnibus;'' Volume 1, New York: DC Comics, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 141 "Since no ongoing creative team had been slated to ''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen'', "King of Comics" Jack Kirby made the title his DC launch point, and the writer/artist's indelible energy and ideas permeated every panel and word balloon of the comic."&lt;/ref&gt; The three books Kirby originated dealt with aspects of mythology he'd previously touched upon in ''Thor''. ''The New Gods'' would establish this new mythos, while in ''The Forever People'' Kirby would attempt to mythologise the lives of the young people he observed around him.  The third book, ''Mister Miracle'' was more of a personal myth. The title character was an escape artist, which Mark Evanier suggests Kirby channeled his feelings of constraint into. Mister Miracle's wife was based in character on Kirby's wife Roz, and he even caricatured Stan Lee within the pages of the book as [[Funky Flashman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raphael |first1=Jordan |last2=Spurgeon |first2=Tom |title=Stan Lee and the Rise and Fall of the American Comic Book |date=2004 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=9781613742921 |page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evanier, pp172-7&lt;/ref&gt; The central villain of the Fourth World series, [[Darkseid]], and some of the Fourth World concepts, appeared in ''Jimmy Olsen'' before the launch of the other Fourth World books, giving the new titles greater exposure to potential buyers.

An attempt at creating new formats for comics produced the one-shot black-and-white magazines ''Spirit World'' and ''In the Days of the Mob'' in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 147: "Believing that new formats were necessary for the comics medium to continue evolving, Kirby oversaw the production of what was labeled his 'Speak-Out Series' of magazines: ''Spirit World'' and ''In the Days of the Mob''...Sadly, these unique magazines never found their desired audience."&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirby later produced other DC series such as ''[[OMAC (Buddy Blank)|OMAC]]'',&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 161 "In ''OMAC's'' first issue, editor/writer/artist Jack Kirby warned readers of "The World That's Coming!", a future world containing wild concepts that are almost frighteningly real today."&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kamandi]]'',&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 153 "Kirby had already introduced a similar concept and characters in ''Alarming Tales'' #1 (1957)...Coupling the premise with his unpublished "Kamandi of the Caves" newspaper strip, Kirby's Last Boy on Earth roamed a world that had been ravaged by the "Great Disaster" and taken over by talking animals."&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Etrigan the Demon|The Demon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 152 "While his "Fourth World" opus was winding down, Jack Kirby was busy conjuring his next creation, which emerged not from the furthest reaches of the galaxy but from the deepest pits of Hell.

The result was a year-long run of ''Our Fighting Forces'' tales that were action-packed, personal, and among the most beloved of World War II comics ever produced."&lt;/ref&gt; Together with former partner Joe Simon for one last time, he worked on a new incarnation of the [[Sandman (DC Comics)|Sandman]].&lt;ref name=gcdjack /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 158 "The legendary tandem of writer Joe Simon and artist/editor Jack Kirby reunited for a one-shot starring the Sandman...Despite the issue's popularity, it would be Simon and Kirby's last collaboration."&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby produced three issues of the ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' anthology series and created [[Atlas (DC Comics)|Atlas The Great]],&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 162: "Debuting with Atlas the Great, writer and artist Jack Kirby didn't shrug at the chance to put his spin on the well-known hero."&lt;/ref&gt; a new [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]],&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 164: "Though ''1st Issue Special'' was primarily DC's forum to introduce new characters and storylines, editor Jack Kirby used the series as an opportunity to revamp the Manhunter, whom he and writer Joe Simon had made famous in the 1940s."&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dingbats of Danger Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Abramowitz|first= Jack|title= ''1st Issue Special'' It Was No ''Showcase'' (But It Was Never Meant To Be)|journal= Back Issue!|issue= 71|pages= 40–47|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|date= April 2014|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirby's production assistant of the time, [[Mark Evanier]], recounted that DC's policies of the era were not in synch with Kirby's creative impulses, and that he was often forced to work on characters and projects he did not like.&lt;ref name="DAK2"&gt;{{cite news | author = Kraft, David Anthony | author2 = Slifer, Roger | authorlink = David Anthony Kraft | authorlink2 = Roger Slifer | date = April 1983 | title = Mark Evanier | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 2 | pages = 23–34 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, some artists at DC did not want Kirby there, as he threatened their positions in the company; they also had bad blood from previous competition with Marvel and legal problems with him. Since he was working from California, they were able to undermine his work through redesigns in the New York office.&lt;ref&gt;Ro, chapters 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Marvel (1976–1978)==
At the [[comic book convention]] Marvelcon '75, in 1975, Stan Lee used a Fantastic Four panel discussion to announce that Kirby was returning to Marvel after having left in 1970 to work for DC Comics. Lee wrote in his monthly column, "Stan Lee's Soapbox", "I mentioned that I had a special announcement to make. As I started telling about Jack's return, to a totally incredulous audience, everyone's head started to snap around as Kirby himself came waltzin' down the aisle to join us on the rostrum! You can imagine how it felt clownin' around with the co-creator of most of Marvel's greatest strips once more."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bullpen Bulletins]]: "The King is Back! 'Nuff Said!", in Marvel Comics cover-dated October 1975, including ''Fantastic Four'' #163&lt;/ref&gt;

Back at Marvel, Kirby both wrote and drew the monthly ''Captain America'' series&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 175: "After an absence of half a decade, Jack Kirby returned to Marvel Comics as writer, penciller, and editor of the series he and Joe Simon created back in 1941."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the ''Captain America's Bicentennial Battles'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] in the oversized [[Marvel Treasury Edition|treasury format]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Powers|first = Tom|title = Kirby Celebrating America's 200th Birthday: ''Captain America's Bicentennial Battles''|journal = Back Issue!|issue = 61|pages = 46–49 |publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|date = December 2012|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created the series ''[[Eternals (comics)|The Eternals]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 175: "Jack Kirby's most important creation for Marvel during his return in the 1970s was his epic series ''The Eternals''"&lt;/ref&gt; which featured a race of inscrutable alien giants, the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], whose behind-the-scenes intervention in primordial humanity would eventually become a core element of [[Marvel Universe]] continuity. He produced an adaptation and expansion of the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (comics)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 180: "Marvel published its adaptation of director Stanley Kubrick and writer Arthur C. Clarke's classic science fiction film ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' as an oversize ''Marvel Treasury Special''."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an abortive attempt to do the same for the classic television series ''[[The Prisoner in other media#Marvel Comics|The Prisoner]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hatfield |first=Charles |url=http://www.twomorrows.com/kirby/articles/11prisoner.html |title=Once Upon A Time: Kirby's Prisoner |journal=The Jack Kirby Collector |issue=11 |date=July 1996 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uDqi8sF0?url=http://www.twomorrows.com/kirby/articles/11prisoner.html |archivedate=November 14, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote and drew ''Black Panther'' and drew numerous covers across the line.&lt;ref name=gcdjack /&gt;

Kirby's other Marvel creations in this period include [[Machine Man]]&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 185: "In [''2001: A Space Odyssey''] issue #8, cover dated July 1977, [Jack] Kirby introduced a robot whom he originally dubbed 'Mister Machine.' Marvel's ''2001'' series eventually came to an end but Kirby's robot protagonist went on to star in his own comic book series as Machine Man."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Devil Dinosaur]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 185: "Jack Kirby's final major creation for Marvel Comics was perhaps his most unusual hero: an intelligent dinosaur resembling a ''Tyrannosaurus rex''."&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby's final comics collaboration with Stan Lee, ''The Silver Surfer: The Ultimate Cosmic Experience'', was published in 1978 as part of the [[Marvel Fireside Books]] series and is considered Marvel's first [[graphic novel]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 187: "[In 1978], Simon &amp; Schuster's Fireside Books published a paperback book titled ''The Silver Surfer'' by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby...This book was later recognized as Marvel's first true graphic novel."&lt;/ref&gt;

Still dissatisfied with Marvel's treatment of him,&lt;ref&gt;"Ploog &amp; Kirby Quit Marvel over Contract Dispute", ''The Comics Journal'' #44, January 1979, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and with an offer of employment from [[Hanna-Barbera]],&lt;ref&gt;Evanier, ''King of Comics'', p. 189: "In 1978, an idea found him. It was an offer from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon studio in Hollywood."&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby left Marvel to work in animation. In that field, he did designs for ''[[Turbo Teen]]'', ''[[Thundarr the Barbarian]]'' and other animated series for television.&lt;ref name="DAK2"/&gt; He worked on ''[[The New Fantastic Four]]'' animated series, reuniting him with scriptwriter Stan Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Fischer|first= Stuart|title= The Fantastic Four and Other Things: A Television History|journal= Back Issue!|issue= 74|page= 30|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|date= August 2014|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|quote= Stan Lee was a consultant to this series, and Jack Kirby played a very important part in this show as an animator and helped design the show.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He illustrated an adaptation of the Walt Disney movie ''[[The Black Hole]]'' for ''[[Walt Disney's Treasury of Classic Tales|Walt Disney’s Treasury of Classic Tales]]'' syndicated comic strip in 1979-80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kirby.htm |title=Jack Kirby |date=March 6, 2009 |publisher=[[Lambiek|Lambiek Comiclopedia]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ObG3hyOg?url=http://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kirby.htm |archivedate=April 5, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Kirby drew concept art for film producer Barry Geller's script treatment adapting [[Roger Zelazny]]'s science fiction novel, ''[[Lord of Light]]'', for which Geller had purchased the rights. In collaboration, Geller commissioned Kirby to draw set designs that would be used as architectural renderings for a Colorado [[theme park]] to be called Science Fiction Land; Geller announced his plans at a November press conference attended by Kirby, former American football star [[Rosey Grier]], writer [[Ray Bradbury]], and others. While the film did not come to fruition, Kirby's drawings were used for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s "[[Canadian Caper]]", in which some members of the [[Embassy of the United States, Tehran|U.S. embassy in Tehran]], Iran, who had avoided capture in the [[Iran hostage crisis]], were able to escape the country posing as members of a movie location-scouting crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Joshuah Bearman |last=Bearman |first=Joshuah |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.05/feat_cia.html |title=How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans from Tehran |newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |issue=15.05 |date=April 24, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uDqr6hh2?url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.05/feat_cia.html |archivedate=November 14, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Kirby and [[Gil Kane]] helped to create the concept and designs for the [[Ruby-Spears]] animated television series ''[[The Centurions (TV series)|The Centurions]]''. A comic-book series based on the show was published by DC and a toy line produced by [[Kenner Products|Kenner]]. In the twilight of his life, Kirby spent a great deal of time sparring with Marvel executives over the ownership rights of his original page boards. At Marvel, many of these pages owned by the company (due to outdated and legally dubious copyright claims) were given away as promotional gifts to Marvel clients or simply stolen from company warehouses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Comic Book History of Comics|last=Van Lente|first=Fred|publisher=IDW|year=2012|isbn=|location=San Diego|pages=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the passage of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], which greatly expanded artist copyright capabilities, comics publishers began to return original art to creators, but in Marvel's case only if they signed a release reaffirming Marvel's ownership of the copyright.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1985, Marvel issued a release that demanded Kirby affirm that his art was created for hire, allowing Marvel to retain copyright in perpetuity, in addition to demanding that Kirby forego all future royalties.

Kirby was [[Honorable discharge|honorably discharged]] as a [[Private First Class]] on July 20, 1945, having received a [[Combat Infantryman Badge]], a [[European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal|European/African/Middle Eastern Campaign Medal]] and a [[Bronze Star Medal]].&lt;ref name=markev69&gt;Evanier, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ro, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Kirby bought a house for his family in [[Mineola, New York]], on [[Long Island]],&lt;ref name=ro46/&gt; This would be the family's home for the next 20 years, with Kirby working out of a basement studio just {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide, which the family referred to jocularly as "The Dungeon".&lt;ref name=HeroComplex&gt;{{cite news | url = http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2012/04/09/growing-up-kirby-the-marvel-memories-of-jack-kirbys-son/#/0 | last = Kirby | first = Neal | title = Growing Up Kirby: The Marvel memories of Jack Kirby's son | date= April 9, 2012 | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate = December 28, 2012 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131027080956/http://herocomplex.latimes.com/comics/growing-up-kirby-the-marvel-memories-of-jack-kirbys-son/#/0 | archivedate= October 27, 2013 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved the family to Southern California in early 1969, both to live in a drier climate for the sake of daughter Lisa's health, and to be closer to the Hollywood studios Kirby believed might provide work.&lt;ref&gt;Evanier, ''King of Comics'', pp. 157, 160 (unnumbered): "...drove Jack to distraction, and from there to Southern California.

===Narrative approach to comics===

Like many of his contemporaries, Kirby was hugely indebted to [[Milton Caniff]], [[Hal Foster]] and [[Alex Raymond]], who codified many of the tropes of narrative art in adventure [[comic strip]]s.  It has also been suggested that Kirby also drew from [[Burne Hogarth]], whose dynamic figure work may have informed the way Kirby drew figures; "his ferocious bounding, and grotesquely articulated figures seem directly descended from Hogarth's dynamically contorted forms."&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield (2012), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; His style drew on these influences, all major artists at the time Kirby was learning his craft, with Caniff, Foster and Raymond between them imparting to the sequential adventure comic strip a highly illustrative approach based on realising the setting to a very high degree. Where Kirby diverged from these influences, and where his style impacted on the formation of comic book art, was in his move away from an illustrated approach to one that was more dynamic. Kirby's artistic style was one that captured energy and motion within the image, synergising with the text and helping to serve the narrative. In contrast, successors to the illustrative approach, such as [[Gil Kane]], found their work eventually reach an impasse. The art would illustrate, but in lacking movement caused the reader to contemplate the art as much as the written word. Later artists such as [[Bryan Hitch]] and [[Alex Ross]] combined the Kirby and Kane approaches, using highly realistic backgrounds contrasted with dynamic characters to create what became known as a widescreen approach to comics.&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield (2012), p. 63-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirby's dynamism and energy served to push the reader through the story where an illustrative, detailed approach would cause the eye to linger.&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield (2012), p. 65-67&lt;/ref&gt; His reduction of the presentation of a given scene down to one that represents the semblance of movement has led Kirby to be described as cinematic in his style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hatfield |first1=Charles |title=Alternative comics : an emerging literature |date=2005 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson, Miss. |isbn=1578067197 |page=54 |edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Having worked at the [[Fleischer Studio]]s before coming to comics, Kirby had a grounding in animation techniques for producing motion. He also realised that comic books weren't subject to the same constraints as the newspaper strip. While other comic book artists recreated the layouts that format used, Kirby swiftly utilised the space a whole comic book page created.&lt;ref name=RC /&gt; As Ron Goulart describes, "(h)e broke up the pages in new ways and introduced splash panels that stretched across two pages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goulart |first1=Ron |title=The great comic book artists |date=1986 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0312345577 |page=56 |edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby himself described the creation of his dynamic style as a reaction both to the cinema and to the urge to create and compete: I found myself competing with the movie camera. I had to compete with the camera. I felt like [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]]... I tore my characters out of the panels. I made them jump all over the page. I tried to make that cohesive so that it would be easier to read... I had to get my characters in extreme positions, and in doing so I created an extreme style which was recognizable by everybody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eisner |first1=Will |title=Will Eisner's shop talk. |date=2001 |publisher=Dark Horse Comics |location=Milwaukie, Or. |isbn=9781569715369 |page=211 |edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style===

In the early 1940s Kirby would at times disregard [[Glossary of comics terminology#Panel|panel]] borders. A character would be drawn in one panel, but their shoulder and arm would extend outside the border, into the [[Glossary of comics terminology#Gutter|gutter]] and sometimes on top of a nearby panel.  A character may be punched out of one panel, feet being in the original panel and body in the next. Panels themselves would overlap, and Kirby would find new ways to arrange panels on a comic book page. His figures were depicted as lithe and graceful, although Kirby would place them thrusting from the page towards the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield (2012), p. 24-5 &amp; 69-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hatfield &amp; Saunders, p. 11"&gt;Hatfield &amp; Saunders, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RCH&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harvey |first1=Robert C. |title=The art of the comic book : an aesthetic history |date=1996 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson |isbn=0878057587 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late 1940s and 1950s saw Kirby move away from superhero comics and, working with Joe Simon, try his hand at a number of genres.  Kirby and Simon created the [[romance comics]] genre, and working in this as well as the war, Western and crime genres saw Kirby's style change. He left behind the diverse panel framing and layouts. The nature of these genres enabled him to channel the energy into the posing and blocking of characters, forcing the drama into the constraints of the panel.&lt;ref name="Hatfield &amp; Saunders, p. 11"/&gt;

When Kirby and [[Stan Lee]] came together at [[Marvel Comics]], his art developed again.  His characters and representations became more abstract, less anatomically correct. He would place figures across three planes of a panels depth to suggest three dimensions.&lt;ref name=AC&gt;Hatfield (2005), p. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; His backgrounds would be less detailed where he did not want the eye to be drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fischer |first1=Craig |title=Kirby: Attention Paid |url=http://www.tcj.com/kirby-attention-paid/ |website=The Comics Journal |publisher=Fantagraphics Press |accessdate=May 31, 2018 |date=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His figures would move actively along diagonals,&lt;ref name=AC /&gt; and he utilised [[foreshortening]] to make a character appear to recede more deeply into the panel, so that they appeared to move towards the reader, off the page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feiffer |first1=Jules |title=The great comic book heroes |date=2003 |quote= Muscles stretched magically, foreshortened shockingly. | publisher=Fantagraphics Books |location=Seattle, Wash. |isbn=9781560975014 |page=59 |edition= 1st Fantagraphics Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RCH /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Conversations With Jack Kirby|editor=Morrow, John|ISBN=1893905020|magazine=The Collected Jack Kirby Collector|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=2004|volume=3|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s Kirby also developed a talent for collages, initially utilising them within the pages of ''[[The Fantastic Four]]''. He introduced the [[Negative Zone]] as a place within the Marvel Universe that would only be illustrated via collage.  However the reproduction within the published comics of the collages, coupled with the low page rate he was being paid and the time they took to develop saw their use discarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mark Evanier ; introduction by Neil Gaiman |title=Kirby : king of comics |date=2008 |publisher=Abrams |location=New York |isbn=9780810994478 |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kirby would later return to the use of collage in his Fourth World work at [[DC Comics]]. Here he used them most often in the pages of ''[[Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield &amp; Saunders, p. 89-99&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirby's style in the late 1960s was regarded so highly by Stan Lee that he instituted it as Marvel's house style. Lee would instruct other artists to draw more like Jack, and would also assign them books to work on using Kirby's breakdowns of the story so that they could more closely hew to Kirby's style.&lt;ref&gt;Hartfield (2012), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, Kirby's style has become so well known that imitations, homages and pastiche are referred to as Kirbyesque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =Generally Speaking | journal = The Comics Journal | issue =107 | page=37 | date=April 1986 | issn=0194-7869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sabin |first1=Roger |title=Comics, comix &amp; graphic novels |date=2001 |publisher=Phaidon |location=London |isbn=9780714839936 |pages=110, 134 &amp; 150 |edition= Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[interviews] by [[Roy Thomas]] &amp; Jim Amash ; introduction by [[Stan Lee]] |title=John Romita --and all that jazz! |date=2007 |publisher=TwoMorrows Pub. |location=Raleigh, N.C. |isbn=1893905756 |page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Rick Veitch Interview |url=http://www.tcj.com/the-rick-veitch-interview/ |website=The Comics Journal |publisher=Fantagraphics Press |accessdate=May 31, 2018}} Originally published in ''The Comics Journal'' #175 (March 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this definition, Kirby's view and depiction of technology is that of it as something to be feared.&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield (2012) p.144-71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working method===
[[File:The_Demon_issue_1_splash.jpg|thumb|right|Jack Kirby's pencils for the splash page to ''[[Etrigan the Demon|The Demon]]'' #1 [[DC Comics]] (September 1972). The detailed pencil work Kirby created can be seen in this art]]
Unlike many of his contemporaries, Kirby did not use preliminary sketches, rough work or layouts. He would instead start with the blank board and draw the story onto the page from top to bottom, start to finish. Many artists, including [[Carmine Infantino]], Gil Kane and [[Jim Steranko]] have remarked on the unusual nature of his method. Kirby would rarely erase while working, the art, and therefore the story, would flow from him almost fully formed.&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby's pencils had a reputation for being detailed, to the point that they were difficult to ink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Walt Simonson Interviewed|editor=Morrow, John|ISBN=1893905020|magazine=The Collected Jack Kirby Collector|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=2004|volume=3|page=112|quote=...it's so powerful in pencil, it's really hard to ink it and really retain the full flavour of the pencils. I think a lot of really good inkers have not been able to do that}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Chic Stone Speaks|editor=Morrow, John|ISBN=1893905020|magazine=The Collected Jack Kirby Collector|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=2004|volume=3|page=90|quote=I was totally awestruck by the magnificent penciling ... no one inker could improve on Jack's penciling}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Will Eisner]] remembers even in the early years that Kirby's pencils were "tight".&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Working for Eisner, Kirby initially inked with a pen, not confident enough in his ability to use the Japanese brushes Lou Fine and Eisner preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Kirby worked with [[Joe Simon]], Kirby had taught himself to use a brush, and would on occasion ink over inked work where he felt it was needed.&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the amount of work Kirby produced, it was rare for him to ink his own work. Instead the pencilled pages were sent on to an inker. Different inkers would therefore impact on the published version of Kirby's art, with Kirby himself noting that individual inkers were suited to different genres.&lt;ref name=ink&gt;Interview, ''The Nostalgia Journal'' #30–1, November 1976–December 1976, reprinted in George, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; For a period during the 1950s, when work had dried up, it's been suggested by Harry Mendryk that Kirby inked himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mendryk |first1=Harry |title=Jack Kirby’s Austere Inking, Chapter 1, Introduction |url=http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/simonandkirby/archives/824 |website=Jack Kirby Museum &amp; Research Center |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |date=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1960s, Kirby preferred to pencil, feeling that "inking in itself is a separate kind of art."&lt;ref name=ink /&gt; [[Stan Lee]] recalls Kirby not really being too interested in who inked him: "I cared much more about who inked Kirby than Kirby did... Kirby never seemed to care who inked him... I think Kirby felt his style was so strong that it just didn't matter who inked him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-last=Thomas |editor1-first=Roy |editor1-link=Roy Thomas |title=The Retrospective Stan Lee |journal=Alter Ego |date=2017 |issue=150 |page=13 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chic Stone]], an inker of Kirby's during the 1960s at Marvel, recalled "(T)he two best [inkers] for Jack were [[Mike Royer]] and [[Steve Rude]]. Both truly maintained the integrity of Jack's pencils."&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the [[Bristol board|art board]] made a difference to Kirby's style. During the late 1960s the industry shrunk the size of the art board artists used. Prior to 1967, art boards were around 14 x 21 inches, being reproduced at 7 x 10 inches. After 1967 the size of the board shrunk to 15 x 10.&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield &amp; Saunders, p. 36-7&lt;/ref&gt; This affected the way Kirby drew. Gil Kane noted that "the amount of space around the figures became less and less [...] The figures became bigger and bigger, and they couldn't be contained by a single panel or even a single page".&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield &amp; Saunders, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Craig Fischer asserts Kirby at first "hated" the new size.&lt;ref name="Hatfield &amp; Saunders, p. 37"&gt;Hatfield &amp; Saunders, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer argues that it took Kirby around 18 months to negotiate a way of working at the smaller size.  Initially he retreated to a less detailed, close up style, as seen in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #68.  In adjusting to the new size, Kirby began utilising depth to bring the pages to life, increasing his use of foreshortening.&lt;ref name="Hatfield &amp; Saunders, p. 37"/&gt; By the time Kirby had moved to DC, he started to incorporate the use of two page spreads into his art more. These spreads helped define the mood of the story, and came to define Kirby's late era work.&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield &amp; Saunders, p. 149-157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibitions and original art===
Kirby's art has been exhibited as part of the Masters of American Comics joint exhibition by [[The Hammer Museum]] and [[The Museum of Contemporary Art]] from November 2005 to March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Masters of American Comics|url=https://hammer.ucla.edu/exhibitions/2005/masters-of-american-comics/|publisher=[[The Hammer Museum]]|accessdate=May 31, 2018|archivedate=June 9, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180609221650/https://hammer.ucla.edu/exhibitions/2005/masters-of-american-comics/|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Charles Hatfield curated the "Comic Book Apocalypse" exhibition at the [[California State University, Northridge]] Art Galleries. The exhibition focused on Kirby's work from 1965 onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comic Book Apocalypse: The Graphic World of Jack Kirby |url=https://www.csun.edu/mike-curb-arts-media-communication/events/comic-book-apocalypse-graphic-world-jack-kirby |website=California State University, Northridge |accessdate=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 "A Jack Kirby Odyssey" was organised by Tom Kraft.  The exhibition displayed photocopies of unpublished Kirby's pencils for stories intended for publication in the ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (comics)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' comic book adaptation series as well as reproductions of the published work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Take "A Jack Kirby Odyssey" in NYC May 11–13! |url=http://kirbymuseum.org/blog/2018/04/19/kirby-odyssey/ |website=Jack Kirby Museum &amp; Research Center |accessdate=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 [[The Cartoon Museum|The Cartoon Art Trust]] organised an exhibition in 
[[London]] of Kirby art, "Jack Kirby: The King of Comic Books", in the wake of Kirby's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Morrow |editor1-first=John |title=Collected Jack Kirby Collector |date=February 19, 2004 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=1893905004 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Dan Nadel and [[Paul Gravett]] curated "Jack Kirby: The House That Jack Built", a retrospective of Kirby's career from 1942 to 1985. The exhibition was part of the [[Fumetto International Comics Festival]] held in [[Lucerne, Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jack Kirby: The House That Jack Built |url=http://www.paulgravett.com/articles/article/jack_kirby2 |website=Paul Gravett |accessdate=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirby's original art regularly sells at auction, with [[Heritage Auctions]] listing the cover of ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #84, inked by [[Frank Giacoia]] as realising a price of $167,300 in a February 2014 auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jack Kirby |url=https://fineart.ha.com/artist-index/jack-kirby.s?id=500022980 |website=Heritage Auctions |accessdate=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large portion of Kirby's art remains unaccounted for. Work created around [[World War II]] would have been reused or pulped due to paper shortages. [[DC Comics]] had a policy of destroying original art in the 1950s. [[Marvel Comics]] would also destroy art, up until 1960, when it stored artwork prior to a policy which saw art returned to the artist. In Kirby's case, it's reported he was returned roughly 2100 pieces of the estimated 10,000 pages drawn. The whereabouts of these missing pages are unknown, although some do turn up for sale, provenance unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Gold, Glen | magazine=Jack Kirby Collector | issue = 19 | date = April 1998 | title = The Stolen Art | url = http://www.twomorrows.com/kirby/articles/19stolen.html | access-date= May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield (2012), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Glen David Gold wrote in ''Masters of American Comics'' that, "Kirby elevates all of us into a realm where we fly among the beating wings of the immortal and the omnipotent, the gods and the monsters, so that we, dreamers all, can play host to the demons of creation, can become our own myths.&lt;ref&gt;Carlin, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;
