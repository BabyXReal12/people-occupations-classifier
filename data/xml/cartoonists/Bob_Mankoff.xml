'''Robert "Bob" Mankoff''' (born May 1, 1944&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;Wilson, Craig. "Top drawer at 'The New Yorker' Mankoff makes his imprint as cartoon editor," ''USA Today'' (2 October 1997): D, 1:2.&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[United States|American]] [[cartoonist]], [[editor]], and [[author]]. He was the [[cartoon]] editor for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine from 1997 to April 29, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cavna|first1=Michael|title=As Bob Mankoff steps down as New Yorker’s cartoon editor, here are his favorite works|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2017/04/28/as-bob-mankoff-steps-down-as-new-yorkers-cartoon-editor-here-are-his-favorite-works/|accessdate=April 29, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before he succeeded [[Lee Lorenz]] as cartoon editor, Mankoff was a cartoonist for ''The New Yorker'' for twenty years.

==Early life==
Mankoff grew up in [[Queens, New York]], and attended [[Music and Art High School]]&lt;ref name=transcript&gt;Mankoff, Robert. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56757-2004Oct23.html "Comics: Meet the Artist," (transcript),] ''Washington Post'' (November 5, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; (graduating in 1962) and [[Syracuse University]] (graduating in 1966).&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131206093430/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/bios/robert_mankoff/search?contributorName=Robert%20Mankoff Mankoff bio,] ''New Yorker'' website. Accessed April 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Mankoff submitted more than 500 cartoons to ''The New Yorker'' for over two years before he had his first one published&lt;ref name=transcript /&gt; in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.condenaststore.com/-sp/No-Thursday-s-out-How-about-never-is-never-good-for-you-New-Yorker-Cartoon-Prints_i8534483_.htm "No, Thursday's out. How about never—is never good for you?" ''New Yorker'' cartoon by Robert Mankoff], Conde Nast Online Store. Accessed April 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his cartoons (captioned "No, Thursday's out. How about never—is never good for you?") is one of ''The New Yorker'''s most widely reprinted cartoons.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;&lt;ref name="What Makes Us Get It"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2014/03/24/293761256/new-yorker-cartoon-editor-explores-what-makes-us-get-it | title='New Yorker' Cartoon Editor Explores What Makes Us Get It | publisher=[[NPR]] | work=[[Fresh Air]] |author=[[Gross, Terry]] | date=March 24, 2014 | accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Mankoff founded the online Cartoon Bank,&lt;ref name=Fleishman&gt;Fleishman, Glenn. [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/29/technology/new-yorker-cartoons-to-go-on-line.html?smid=pl-share "New Yorker Cartoons to Go on Line,"] ''New York Times'' (October 29, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; a licensing platform for ''New Yorker'' cartoons and art, with more than 85,000 cartoons available for sale. Mankoff was hired as ''New Yorker'' cartoon editor in 1997;&lt;ref name=Fleishman /&gt; he credits his administration of the Cartoon Bank as being an important reason for why he was chosen to replace Lorenz.&lt;ref name=transcript /&gt; [[Tina Brown]], ''The New Yorker'''s editor at the time, said of Mankoff, "Bob is not only a brilliant cartoonist himself, he's also an impassioned promoter, defender and curator of the art of cartooning. … He's put himself out to nurture cartoonists."&lt;ref name=USAToday /&gt;

Mankoff has stated that his all-time favorite ''New Yorker'' cartoonist is [[Jack Ziegler]].&lt;ref name=transcript /&gt; He has also cited [[Shel Silverstein]] as an artist he would have liked as a contributing cartoonist.&lt;ref name=transcript /&gt; Under Mankoff, the magazine has brought in a new generation of cartoonists (including a number of female contributors); notable names include [[Pat Byrnes]], [[J. C. Duffy]], [[P. C. Vey]], [[Farley Katz]], [[Emily Flake]], and  [[Julia Suits]]. Mankoff usually contributes a short article to each issue of ''The New Yorker'', describing some aspect of the cartooning process or the methods used to select cartoons for the magazine.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Under Mankoff's stewardship, in April 2005 the magazine began using the last page of each issue for the subsequently very popular "The New Yorker Cartoon [[Caption contest|Caption Contest]]" (prior that date, the Caption Contest had appeared as a back-page feature in the magazine's annual "Cartoon Issue"). Mankoff himself contributes cartoons to ''[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]]'' magazine's own monthly cartoon caption contest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.momentmag.com/cartoon/ "Moment Cartoon Caption Contest,"] ''Moment'' website. Accessed May 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a lecturer on the appreciation of humor, Mankoff is represented by the [[Leigh Bureau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighbureau.com/speaker.asp?id=427 Mankoff bio], Leigh Bureau website. Accessed April 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mankoff is mentioned in [[MC Paul Barman]]'s song "Cock Mobster" on the 2002 album ''[[Paullelujah!]]''&lt;ref&gt;Mankoff, Robert. [http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/cartoonists/2010/08/caption-rap.html "Rhyme Scheme,"] ''The New Yorker'' online: The Cartoon Bureau (August 26, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Mankoff left ''The New Yorker'' and was named Humor and Cartoon Editor at ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine on May 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Cavna, Michael. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2017/05/01/bob-mankoff-named-humor-editor-for-esquire-after-exiting-new-yorker-job/ "Bob Mankoff named humor editor for Esquire one day after exiting the New Yorker,"] ''Washington Post'' (May 1, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life ==
Mankoff and his wife Cory live in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]]; they have one daughter together, Sarah. Cory also had a son who died in 2012. &lt;ref name=bio /&gt;&lt;ref name="Briarcliff"&gt;{{cite news |last=Minzesheimer |first=Bob |title=Bob Mankoff, New Yorker cartoon editor, at the Burns |url=http://www.lohud.com/story/life/2014/04/21/new-york-cartoon-editotr-bob-mankoff/7979717/ |accessdate=January 19, 2015 |newspaper=The Journal News |date=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Films ==
The 2015 documentary, ''Very Semi-Serious'', presents a behind-the-scenes look at the cartoons of ''The New Yorker'', and features glimpses into Mankoff's career, his role at ''The New Yorker'', and his personal life.  The film was produced by Redora Films.
