'''Jeff Smith''' (born February 27, 1960)&lt;ref name=ScholasticBio/&gt; is an American [[cartoonist]]. He is best known as the creator of the [[self-publishing|self-published]] [[comic book]] series ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]''.

==Early life==
Jeff Smith was born in [[McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref name=ScholasticBio/&gt; to William Earl Smith and Barbara Goodsell.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jeff (2006). ''[[Bone: Eyes of the Storm]]''. Graphix/Scholastic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="washtimes"&gt;Szadkowski, Joseph; Smith, Jeff (June 16, 2007). [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/jun/15/20070615-091422-5597r/ "Mix of tradition, fantasy comics pays off for artist"]. ''[[The Washington Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith learned about cartooning from comic strips, [[comic book]]s, and animated TV shows.&lt;ref name="bonevillebio"&gt;[http://www.boneville.com/jeffs-studio/about-jeff-smith/ "About Jeff Smith"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712035553/http://www.boneville.com/jeffs-studio/about-jeff-smith/ |date=2013-07-12 }}. Boneville. Retrieved July 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The strip he found to be the most entertaining was [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]'', which he had his father read to him every Sunday, and which inspired him to learn to read.&lt;ref name=TheCartoonist&gt;{{cite AV media|people = Ken Mills (Director) |title =[[The Cartoonist: Jeff Smith, BONE and the Changing Face of Comics]]|medium = Documentary|publisher = Mills James Productions|date = July 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BoneAndBeyond&gt;Lucy Shelton Caswell and David Filipi, ''Jeff Smith: Bone and Beyond'' (Columbus, O.: The Ohio State University, Wexner Center for the Arts, 2008), {{ISBN|978-1-881390-46-6}}, pp. 7, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was also inspired by [[Scrooge McDuck]] creator [[Carl Barks]],&lt;ref name=TheCartoonist/&gt; whom Smith calls a "natural comic genius" for his ability to move characters effectively from panel to panel, and for their expressiveness. Alluding to the influence of Barks' influence on ''Bone'', Smith commented, "I always wanted Uncle Scrooge to go on a longer adventure. I thought, 'Man, if you could just get a comic book of that quality, the length of say, ''[[War and Peace]]'', or ''[[The Odyssey]]'' or something, that would be something I would love to read, and even as a kid I looked everywhere for that book, that Uncle Scrooge story that was 1,100 pages long."&lt;ref name=TheCartoonist/&gt; Another seminal influence began when Smith was nine, and he saw ''[[The Pogo Special Birthday Special]]'' on TV, which was created by [[Walt Kelly]] and [[Chuck Jones]], whom he would later call "two of my most favorite people". The day after that program aired, a girl brought her father's ''Pogo'' book to school and gave it to Smith, who says it "changed comics" for him. Smith keeps that book on a table next to his drawing board today,&lt;ref name=TheCartoonist/&gt;&lt;ref name=JimLehrer&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/july-dec08/cartoonexhibit_07-21.html "Jeff Smith's 'Bone' Goes From Comic Book to Gallery Wall"]. ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]''. July 21, 2008. Retrieved January 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to Kelly as his "biggest influence in writing comics".&lt;ref name=BoneAndBeyond/&gt;

Smith has cited ''[[Moby Dick]]'' as his favorite book, citing its multi-layered narrative and symbolism, and placed numerous references to it in ''Bone''. He has also cited ''[[Huckleberry Finn]]'' as a story after which he attempted to pattern ''Bone'' structurally, explaining, "the kinds of stories I’m drawn to, like ''Huckleberry Finn'', are the ones that start off very simple, almost like children’s stories...but as it goes on, it gets a little darker, and the themes become a little more sophisticated and more complex—and those are really the kinds of stories that just get me going." Other influences in this regard include the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and the classic fairy tales and mythologies that inspired those works.&lt;ref name=TheCartoonist/&gt;

Smith says the earliest forerunner drawings of what later became Bone and his cousins occurred when he was about five, and sitting in his living room drawing, and he drew what looked like an old C-shaped telephone [[handset receiver]], which emerged as a frowning character with its mouth wide open. Elements of that character and its demeanor found their way into the character Phoney Bone, the upset cousin to Bone. His name is derived from Fonebone, the generic surname that [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]] gave to many of the characters that appeared in his ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine strips.&lt;ref name=TheCartoonist/&gt; Smith began to create comics with the ''Bone'' characters as early as 1970, when he was about 9 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Smith, ''The Art of Bone'' (Milwaukie, Oregon: Dark Horse Books, 2007), {{ISBN|978-1-59307-441-8}}, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith graduated in 1978 from [[Worthington High School]] in [[Worthington, Ohio]], a suburb of Columbus, where he was a classmate of [[Jim Kammerud]]. Later on, in 1986, Smith and Kammerud would co-found Character Builders, an animation studio in Columbus where Smith worked until 1992.&lt;ref name="thisweek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WorthingtonSchools"&gt;[http://whsalumni30yearclub.com/AlumniAward2013.html "Distinguished Alumni Award of Worthington Schools"]. Worthington City Schools. Retrieved July 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; After high school, Smith attended the [[Ohio State University]], and while there he created a comic strip called ''[[Thorn (comic strip)|Thorn]]'' for the student newspaper, ''[[The Lantern]]'', which included some of the characters who later featured in the ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;French, Kristin M. (October 2, 2001).

''[[Columbus Dispatch]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied animation.&lt;ref name=TheCartoonist/&gt;

==Career&lt;!--'Cartoon Books' redirects here--&gt;==
After graduating from college, Smith and his two friends, Jim Kammerud and Marty Fuller, started an animation studio called Character Builders Inc. Their first paid job was producing a 60-second animated opening for the TV series ''[[Super Safari with Jack Hanna]]''. Other jobs followed for clients such as [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]], sequences in films that the studio was given when other studios fell behind, and a [[claymation]] project that they were given following the rise in popularity of [[The California Raisins]]. Initial budgets were restrictive for the studio, which required the animators to be resourceful in order to meet their deadlines. Smith sometimes did the [[voice work]] as well as the animation on certain projects, and the animators sometimes had family members come in on some evenings to paint animation cells. Though Smith found the projects exciting, he realized that it was not the type of cartooning he wanted to do, which was complicated by periods in which the studio had no work. It was during one of these slow periods that Smith reconsidered his career. Drawn to the idea that he could produce his own animated-type story but in the comics medium, and convinced by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', [[Art Spiegelman]]'s ''[[Maus]]'' and [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Watchmen]]'' that a serious comic book with a beginning, middle and end structure was both artistically and commercially viable, Smith decided to produce ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]''.&lt;ref name=TheCartoonist/&gt;

In 1991, Smith launched his company, '''Cartoon Books'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, in order to publish the series.&lt;ref name="bonevillebio"/&gt; Initially, Smith [[self-published]] the book, which meant that he did all the work required to both produce and distribute the series as a business, including answering letters, doing all the graphics and lettering (which he did by hand), sending the artwork to the printer, handling orders and bookkeeping. This made it difficult to focus on writing and drawing the book, and as a result, he fell behind in his production. To remedy this, he asked his wife, Vijaya, to quit her lucrative job at a [[Silicon Valley]] startup company in order to run the business side of Bone as the President of Cartoon Books. As a result, Smith was able to refocus on drawing, and sales improved.&lt;ref name=TheCartoonist/&gt; Smith published 55 issues of ''Bone'' between 1991 and 2004. The black and white comic book proved very successful, and has been collected in a number of trade paperback and hardback collections, including a series of nine books that collect all 55 issues, originally published by Cartoon Books in black and white, and later reissued in color by the Graphix imprint of [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]. In 2004, when Cartoon Books released a "mammoth" one-volume black and white collection of the entire nine-volume series, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' critic Andrew Arnold called ''Bone'' "the best all-ages graphic novel yet published".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Andrew (September 17, 2004). [http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,698456,00.html "No Bones About It"]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Smith created an original cover for [[Dan DeBono]]'s ''Indy - The Independent Comic Guide'' (issue 13), and was interviewed to help to promote his and other [[alternative comics]].

Two additional volumes, ''[[Stupid, Stupid Rat Tails]]'' and ''[[Rose (comics)|Rose]]'', collect a number of Bone prequel comics created by Smith, working with collaborators.

In 2003, Smith began work for [[DC Comics]] on a miniseries starring [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], a superhero of which Smith is a fan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=005004;p=1 |title=Jeff Smith: Bone comics, games &amp; Shazam  |author=Jennifer M. Contino}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series, entitled ''[[Monster Society of Evil|Shazam! The Monster Society of Evil]]'', was published in four [[prestige format]] issues in 2007, and later collected into a hardcover edition.

In 2007, [[Fantagraphics Books]] named Smith as the designer for an upcoming series of books collecting the complete run of Walt Kelly's ''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]''. He also designed the cover art for [[Say Anything (band)|Say Anything's]] album ''[[In Defense of the Genre]]''.

Smith released the first issue of ''[[RASL]]'', "a stark, sci-fi series about a dimension-jumping art thief with personal problems", in February, 2008. A six-page preview was shown on the 2007 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. Originally intending ''RASL'' to be released in an oversized format, Smith consulted with retailers who unanimously cautioned him against the unconventional size.&lt;ref name="tcjreview"&gt;Burns, Ian (April 29, 2010). [http://www.tcj.com/alternative/rasl-1-7-review-by-ian-burns/ "RASL #1-7 review by Ian Burns"] ''[[The Comics Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comixology.com/podcasts/20/RASL-with-Jeff-Smith "It Came Out on Wednesday, presented by comixology" episode 19 interview with Jeff Smith] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305045828/http://www.comixology.com/podcasts/20/RASL-with-Jeff-Smith |date=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith later self-published ''RASL'' as a standard-sized, ad-free, black and white comic book. The first trade paperback, titled ''The Drift'', is in stores in the originally intended oversized format.

Smith's art was featured in a pair of museum shows in Columbus in mid-2008: "Jeff Smith: Bone and Beyond" at the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]], and "Jeff Smith: Before Bone" at the [[Cartoon Research Library]] of [[Ohio State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wexarts.org/ex/?eventid=2371 Exhibitions: Jeff Smith: Bone and Beyond] at Wexner Center website.&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibits were featured in a segment on the [[PBS]] news program ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'' on July 21, 2008.

In 2009, Smith was featured in ''[[The Cartoonist: Jeff Smith, BONE, and the Changing Face of Comics]],'' a documentary film on his life and work.&lt;ref name=TheCartoonist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecartoonistmovie.com ''The Cartoonist'']. Retrieved December 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September that same year, [[Toon Books]], the children's book line launched by cartoonist [[Art Spiegelman]] and ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' art editor [[Françoise Mouly]], released ''Little Mouse Gets Ready'', a 32-page children's graphic novel written by Smith and aimed at very young "emerging readers". In a February 2009 [[Newsarama]] interview, Smith noted that the book featured another character Smith created in his childhood, "a little gray mouse with a little red vest".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/14148.html "Jeff Smith Does New Children’s Graphic Novel"].

In March 2013, Smith said his next project would be a [[webcomic]] series called ''Tüki: Save the Humans'', which tells the story of the first human to leave Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johnston, Rich]] (March 31, 2013).
