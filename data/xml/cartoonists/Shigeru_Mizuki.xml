{{nihongo|'''Shigeru Mizuki'''|水木 しげる|Mizuki Shigeru|March 8, 1922 – November 30, 2015}} was a Japanese [[manga artist|manga author]] and historian, best known for his series ''[[GeGeGe no Kitarō]]'' (Japanese: ゲゲゲの鬼太郎, literally "spooky Kitarō") – originally titled ''Hakaba Kitarō'' (Japanese: 墓場鬼太郎, literally "Kitarō of the Graveyard") – ''Kappa no Sanpei'', and ''Akuma-kun''. Born in a hospital in Osaka and raised in the city of [[Sakaiminato, Tottori|Sakaiminato]] in [[Tottori Prefecture|Tottori prefecture]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/the-life-and-death-of-shigeru-mizuki/|title = The Life and Death of Shigeru Mizuki, 1922-2015 The Comics Journal|website = www.tcj.com|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; he later moved to [[Chōfu, Tokyo]] where he remained until his death. His pen-name, Mizuki, comes from the time when he managed an inn called 'Mizuki Manor' while he drew pictures for [[kamishibai]]. A specialist in stories of [[Yōkai]] (妖怪, traditional Japanese monsters, ghouls, and goblins), he is considered a master of the genre. Mizuki was also a noted historian, publishing works relating to world history, Japanese history, and his own [[World War II]] experience.

==Life==
[[File:Shigeru Mizuki at age 18.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Shigeru Mizuki at age 18, c. 1940]]
Mizuki was born '''Shigeru Mura''' (武良 茂 ''Mura Shigeru'') in the city of Osaka, the second of three sons. He was raised in the coastal city of Sakaminato, where he spent much of his childhood as a 'scrapper': picking fights and participating in childish warfare with the neighbouring children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He displayed from an early age a particular talent for art. During his time in elementary school, Mizuki's teachers were so impressed by his skills with a pencil that they organised an exhibition of his work, and he later went on to be featured in the Mainichi newspaper as something of an artistic prodigy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to this penchant for the artistic, Mizuki had an interest in the supernatural - something that was fueled by listening to ghost stories told by a local woman named Fusa Kageyama,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but whom the young Mizuki nicknamed "Nononba".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="japant"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2005/02/06/to-be-sorted/drawing-on-experience-2/#.UyZb5_ldWZU | title=Drawing on experience | author=Otake, Tomoko | date=February 6, 2005 | work=[[The Japan Times]] | accessdate=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Battle of Rabaul (1942)|in 1942]], he was drafted into the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and sent to [[New Britain]] Island in [[Papua New Guinea]]. His wartime experiences affected him greatly, as he contracted [[malaria]], watched friends die from battle wounds and disease, and dealt with other horrors of war. Finally, in an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[airstrike|air raid]], he was caught in an explosion and lost his dominant (left) arm. Regarding this life-changing event, a Nov. 30, 2015 NHK announcement of his death showed excerpts of a video interview with him at age 80, in which he said that as the only survivor of his unit, he was 'ordered to die' — a prospect he considered ridiculous. The result of Mizuki's wartime experience was a concurrent sense of pacifism and goodwill. In the same interview, he explained that his Yōkai characters can be seen only in times of peace, not war, and that he purposely created these supernatural creatures to be of no specific ethnicity or nationality as a hint of the potential for humanity. While in a Japanese [[field hospital]] on [[Rabaul]], he was befriended by the local [[Tolai people|Tolai]] tribespeople, who offered him land, a home, and citizenship via marriage to one of their women.&lt;ref name="Mizuki2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mizuki|first=Shigeru|title=Showa 1944-1953: A History of Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_1_DngEACAAJ|series=[[Showa: A History of Japan]]|volume=3|date=2014|publisher=Drawn &amp; Quarterly Publications|isbn=978-1-77046-162-8|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mizuki acknowledged that he considered remaining behind, but was shamed by a military doctor into returning home to Japan first for medical treatment to his arm and to face his parents, which he did reluctantly.&lt;ref name="japant"/&gt;

Upon arriving home, Mizuki had initially planned to return to New Guinea; however, the [[occupation of Japan]] changed that. His injuries did little to help, nor did the fact that his older brother, an artillery officer, was convicted as a [[War crime|war criminal]] for having prisoners of war executed. After his return to Japan he worked at a variety of jobs including as a fish salesman and kamishibai artist.

In 1957, Mizuki released his debut work, ''Rocketman''. He published numerous works afterwards, both dealing with the military and with yōkai. He has also written many books on both subjects, including an autobiography about his time on New Britain Island and a manga biography of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref name="japant"/&gt; 

In 1972 he publishes the [[gekiga]] graphic novel [[Nonnonba]] about his grandmother.

In 1991, he released a short work titled ''War and Japan'' published in ''The Sixth Grader'', a popular [[edutainment]] magazine for young people, detailing the atrocities committed by the Japanese Army during their rampage in [[Nanjing Massacre|China]] and [[Korea]] and is narrated by [[GeGeGe no Kitaro|Nezumi Otoko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanfocus.org/-Matthew-Penney/2905|title=War and Japan: The Non-Fiction Manga of Mizuki Shigeru|last=Penney |first=Matthew|work=The Asia-Pacific Journal |publisher=Japan Focus |date=September 21, 2008 |accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work serves as a powerful counterpoint to [[Historical revisionism (negationism)#Japanese war crimes|revisionist]] manga like the works of [[Yoshinori Kobayashi]] and by extension a way for Mizuki to express his anger at those responsible for all of Japan's victims. From 1989 till 1998 he works on the series [[Showa:A History of Japan]] following the same approach and describing the Showa history combined with personal anecdotes. In these books Nezumi Otoko is also the narrator.

When not working in either field, he painted a number of subjects, though these works are not as well known as his literary ones which have made him a [[celebrity|household name]]. In 2003, he returned to Rabaul to rekindle his friendship with the locals, who had named a road after him in his honor.

In 2005, Mizuki appeared in a cameo role in ''Yōkai Daisenso'' ("[[The Great Yokai War]]") directed by Takashi Miike, a film about Yōkai inspired by his work as well as the work of [[Hiroshi Aramata|Aramata Hiroshi]]. He appears towards the end of the film in the role of the ''Great Elder Yōkai'': a pacifistic character who condemns the warring ways of the film's antagonist and reaffirms the role of Yōkai as peaceful, playful creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Haunted Travelogue: Hometowns, Ghost Towns, and Memories of War on JSTOR|jstor = 41510934}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brief explanation about his works also is mentioned in the film. In 2010, [[NHK]] broadcast an [[asadora]] about his married life, ''[[GeGeGe no Nyōbō|Gegege no Nyōbō]]'', based on his wife's autobiography.

On November 30, 2015, Shigeru Mizuki died of heart failure in a Tokyo hospital after collapsing at his home from a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-11-29/kitaro-nonnonba-manga-creator-shigeru-mizuki-passes-away/.95919 |title=Kitaro, NonNonBâ Manga Creator Shigeru Mizuki Passes Away |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=November 29, 2015 |accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sakaiminato, Tottori|Sakaiminato]], Mizuki's childhood home, has a street dedicated to the ghosts and monsters that appear in his stories. One hundred bronze statues of the story's characters line both sides of the road. There is also a museum featuring several of his creations and works.
