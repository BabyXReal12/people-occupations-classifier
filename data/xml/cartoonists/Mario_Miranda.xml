'''Mário João Carlos do Rosário de Brito Miranda''' {{postnominals|list=[[Order of Prince Henry|ComIH]]}} (2 May 1926 – 11 December 2011),  popularly known as '''Mario Miranda''' or '''Mario de Miranda''', was an Indian cartoonist and painter based in [[Loutolim]] in the Indian state of [[Goa]].

Miranda had been a regular with ''[[The Times of India]]'' and other newspapers in [[Mumbai]], including ''[[The Economic Times]]'', though he got his popularity with his works published in ''[[The Illustrated Weekly of India]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamat.com/database/pictures/cartoons/mario_miranda.htm Mario Miranda profile at Kamat.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded [[Padma Vibhushan]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=79881|title= Padma Awards|publisher=pib|date= 27 January 2013 |accessdate= 27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Miranda was born in [[Daman District, India|Daman]], then in [[Portuguese India]], to [[Catholic]] parents. At an early age when his mother saw him drawing on his home's walls, she brought him a blank book, which he calls his "Diary". He even started getting into trouble at school, for sketching Catholic priests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiatravelogue.com/face/face14.html Mario interview indiatravelogue]&lt;/ref&gt; Mario Miranda's early cartoons presented vignettes of Goan village life, a theme he is best known for even today.

==Education and early cartooning==
He studied at [[St. Joseph's Boys' High School, Bangalore]] and then did a B.A. in History at [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai]], while focusing on the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). Thereafter he started studying architecture at the behest of his parents, though he soon lost interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.aol.com/podium1/miranda1.html An interview with Mario Miranda]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Miranda started his career in an advertising studio, where he worked for four years, before taking up cartooning full-time. He got his first break as a cartoonist with [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]] which published a few of his works.&lt;ref name="Sardessai"&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2004/03/01/stories/2004030102120300.htm Lines from Goa]&amp;nbsp;– The Hindu, 1 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; His drawings &amp; cartoons also brought him an offer to work at the ''Current'' magazine. A year later, the Times of India offered him a slot, even though they had rejected him at first. Thereafter, his creations, such as Miss Nimbupani and Miss Fonseca, appeared on a regular basis in ''Femina'', ''Economic Times'', and ''[[The Illustrated Weekly of India]]''.

==Return to Mumbai==
After five years in England, Miranda returned to Mumbai and was offered back his old job with the Times of India, where he worked with noted cartoonist, [[R.K. Laxman]].

Thereafter, Miranda met artist Habiba Hydari. They got married and had two sons, Raul and Rishaad.

==Recognition and fame==

Miranda's big break came in 1974, when, at the invitation of the United States Information Services, he travelled to America, which enabled him to promote his art and interact with other cartoonists in the United States and also got a chance to work with [[Charles M. Schulz]], the creator of [[Peanuts]]) and met [[Herblock]], the editorial cartoonist of the Washington Post.

He was awarded the [[Padma Shri]] in 1988, the [[Padma Bhushan]] in 2002&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |title=Padma Awards |publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India |date=2015 |accessdate=July 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6U68ulwpb?url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |archivedate=15 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and All India Cartoonists's Association, Bangalore, honoured him with a lifetime achievement award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goacom.com/goanow/2002/feb/cartoons.html Mario at International Centre, Dona Paula] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626163322/http://www.goacom.com/goanow/2002/feb/cartoons.html |date=26 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The King of Spain, Juan Carlos, conferred on Mario the highest civilian honour of "Cross of the [[Order of Isabel the Catholic]]" which was presented to him on 11 November 2009 at his family home in Loutulim by Don Miguel Nieto Sandoval and on 29 December 2009 Portugal, under the President of the Republic Aníbal António Cavaco Silva, made him "Commander of the [[Order of Prince Henry]]", a Portuguese National Order of knighthood. Mario Miranda was posthumously awarded the [[Padma Vibhushan]], the second highest civilian award in the Republic of India, by the President on 4 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_president-pratibha-patil-confers-padma-awards_1671487]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has held solo exhibitions in over 22 countries, including the United States, Japan, Brazil, Australia, Singapore, France, Yugoslavia, and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goaartgallery.com/mario_miranda.htm Mario at goartgallery]&lt;/ref&gt;

Miranda's cartoons grace the walls of one of South Mumbai's most famous hotspots, [[Cafe Mondegar]], in Colaba. Mario Miranda's caricatures are also seen in the municipal market of [[Panjim]], [[Goa]].

Miranda is also featured in the "[[Mile Sur Mera Tumhara]]" video, which included a host of India's most notable personalities in arts, films, literature, music, and sports.

==Mural in Café Mondegar==
{{Main|Café Mondegar#Murals}}
In 1990s, Rushi Yazdegardi (then owner) asked Mario Miranda to draw [[mural]]s (cartoons) on two opposite walls of [[Café Mondegar]]. Both walls have different themes. Whilst one wall is dedicated to the ''Life in Mumbai'', the other wall is dedicated to ''Atmosphere in the Café''.&lt;ref name="Cartoonist who loved to draw"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cartoonist who loved to draw|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=Jul 2015|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai/mario-miranda-cartoonist-who-loved-to-draw/article1-781069.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Beyond cartooning==
Besides cartooning, Miranda's murals are present on various buildings in Goa and other parts of India. Late in life he took to paintings which received wide response.

Over the years, he published several books, including ''Laugh it Off'', ''Goa with Love'', and ''Germany in Wintertime''.

Besides his own books, he illustrated books by [[Dom Moraes]] (''A Journey to Goa''), Manohar Malgaonkar (''Inside Goa'') and Mario Cabral e Sá's (''Legends of Goa''). He also illustrated many children's books, including Dul-Dul, The Magic Clay Horse (1968), The Adventures of Pilla the Pup (1969), and Lumbdoom, The Long-Tailed Langoor (1968), all written by [[Uma Anand]] and published by [[India Book House]], Mumbai, under its Echo imprint.

He loved to travel and listening to music and it was his ambition to experiment further with water colours and to write memories of his early years in Goa, on retirement. He was not able to fulfil these two latter ambitions.

==Later years and death==
After retirement, Miranda lived in his ancestral home, at [[Loutolim]], a village in [[Salcete]], Goa, with his wife, younger son and their pets. This house features in the 1985 [[Shyam Benegal]] film, ''[[Trikaal]]''. Even after he retired, Miranda's work was seen regularly in Mumbai publications, and he was invited to travel to countries such as Mauritius and Spain, and draw their local cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ET_Features/Special_Pages/Culture_Cauldron/Travels_on_canvas_and_colour/articleshow/2493952.cms Travels on canvas and colour, The Economictimes, 27 Oct 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 December 2011, Mario Miranda died of natural causes at his home in Loutolim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/cartoonist-mario-miranda-dies-at-85/210847-3.html|title=Cartoonist Mario Miranda dies at 85|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|date=11 December 2011| accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral was held on 12/12/11 at Loutulim Saviour of the World Church, where the family choir of Miguel Cotta, rendered for the first time Andrew Lloyd Webber's version of Pie Jesu. Mario's body was then taken to the Hindu Crematorium in Pagifond, Margao, where he was cremated, thus fulfilling his wish, according to his wife.

Indian cartoonist Graphi and fine artist, [[Vins (cartoonist)|Vijay N Seth (Vins)]] paid tribute to Miranda, whom he considered as a mentor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With pen &amp; ink that were at his command to churn out lines that every nib would be jealous of, he brushed aside the old school of cartooning using the brush, and set a new norm to use the nib pen and to master it for this branch of art. Mario created characters that gave his daily audience their quota of a smile without malice. His trips around the globe produced subtle close observations of the local musings – a fitting example of how far can one stretch the parameters of this branch of neglected art.&lt;ref name=vijay&gt;{{cite web|last=Seth (vinns)|first=Vijay N|title=Cartoon-artist Mario: a tribute|date=16 December 2011|url=http://www.indiaartndesign.com/2011/12/cartoon-artist-mario-tribute.html|publisher=India Art and Design|accessdate=16 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707082316/http://www.indiaartndesign.com/2011/12/cartoon-artist-mario-tribute.html|archivedate=7 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2013, a road junction in Mumbai was named after Miranda.&lt;ref name="mmc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Raj Thackeray inaugurates chowk named after cartoonist Mario Miranda |url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/columns/mumbai-001/Raj-Thackeray-inaugurates-chowk-named-after-cartoonist-Mario-Miranda/articleshow/19554304.cms |date=15 April 2013 |location=Mumbai |publisher=[[Mumbai Mirror]] |accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, [[Google]] honoured him with a [[Google Doodle|doodle]] on his 90th birth anniversary. The doodle showcased a typical Mumbai
neighbourhood scene during the rains.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRUmXeiLP-Q Mario Miranda Google Doodle on the occasion of his 90th birthday.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibition on the works of Mário Miranda===
An exhibition named ''A pocketful of chuckles'' on the works of Mário de Miranda is also being held by Galeria Gitanjali, [[Panjim]] from the 30th April, 2016. This is the largest exhibition on the original paintings of Mario de Miranda. ''The life of Mario: 1949'' was also brought out by Gerard da Cunha, a 288-page compilation of caricatures by the 23-year old Mario Miranda in 1949. This is the third in a series that includes the years 1950 and 1951 {{cite news|title=Mario Miranda's biggest exhibition in state gets under way in Panaji |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Mario-Mirandas-biggest-exhibition-in-state-gets-under-way-in-Panaji/articleshow/52061719.cms |accessdate=2 May 2016}}.
