'''Dalia Messick''' (April 11, 1906 &amp;ndash; April 5, 2005) was an American [[comic strip]] artist who used the pseudonym '''Dale Messick'''. She was the creator of ''[[Brenda Starr, Reporter]]'', which at its peak during the 1950s ran in 250 newspapers.

==Early life==
Messick was born in [[South Bend, Indiana]], on April 11, 1906.&lt;ref name=Chronicle&gt;{{cite news|last=Gaura|first= Maria Alicia|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/04/08/BAGFJC54MA1.DTL |title=Dale Messick—cartoonist who drew Brenda Starr,|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=April 8, 2005|accessdate=July 11, 2017|archivedate=March 6, 2016| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306224841/http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Dale-Messick-cartoonist-who-drew-Brenda-Starr-2717059.php| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Cephas Messick, was a sign painter and vocational arts teacher. Her mother Bertha was a milliner and [[seamstress]]; her work inspired some of the glamorous hats used in the Brenda Starr strip.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; After her family moved to [[Hobart, Indiana]], Messick, who repeated third and eighth grades,&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; attended [[Hobart High School (Indiana)|Hobart High School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/lifestyles/ct-ptb-brenda-starr-st-0317-20170309-story.html |title=Porter County Museum honors Brenda Starr creator| work=[[Post-Tribune]]| location=Northwest Indiana| first=Philip |last=Potempa|date=March 9, 2017|accessdate= July 11, 2017|archivedate=April 21, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421084006/http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/lifestyles/ct-ptb-brenda-starr-st-0317-20170309-story.html|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; earning her degree at age 20.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; She studied for one summer at the Ray Commercial Art School in [[Chicago]], but left to begin a career as a professional artist.&lt;ref name=AWN&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/dale-messick-comic-strip-life|title=Dale Messick: A Comic Strip Life|first=Jackie|last=Leger|date=July 1, 2000|accessdate=July 11, 2017|publisher=Animation World Network|archivedate=July 11, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6rt7gubPW?url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/dale-messick-comic-strip-life|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greeting cards==
Messick began working for a Chicago [[greeting card]] company&lt;ref name=Post/&gt; and was successful but quit when her boss lowered her pay during the [[Great Depression]]. In 1933, she moved to [[New York City]] where she found work with another greeting card company at a higher salary, $50 a week, sending nearly half of it back to her family in Indiana. She recalled, "I had $30 a week to live it up. You could walk down 42nd Street and have bacon and eggs and toast and coffee and hash brown potatoes and orange juice&amp;mdash;the works&amp;mdash;for 25 cents."&lt;ref name=Post/&gt;&lt;ref name=Howell/&gt;

==Comic strips==
She began assembling a portfolio of comic strip samples. Messick was not the first female comic strip creator; [[Nell Brinkley]], [[Gladys Parker]] and [[Edwina Dumm]] had all achieved success in the field, but there was still a bias against women. Messick decided to change her first name to the androgynous "Dale" so her work would be seen by editors.&lt;ref name=Post&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35837-2005Apr7.html|title=Cartoonist Dale Messick Dies; Creator of ''Brenda Starr'' Strip|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 8, 2005|page=B06|accessdate=July 11, 2017|archivedate=February 5, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130205182620/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35837-2005Apr7.html|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She created a variety of comic strips (''Weegee'', ''Mimi the Mermaid'', ''Peg and Pudy, the Struglettes'', ''Streamline Babies''), but none was selected for publication.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==''Brenda Starr, Reporter''==
Messick created the character of Brenda Starr in 1940, naming it after 1930s [[debutante]] [[Brenda Frazier]],&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; and basing her appearance on [[Rita Hayworth]].&lt;ref name=Chronicle/&gt; Messick wanted to produce a strip with a female protagonist; she decided a career as a reporter would allow her character to travel and have adventures, albeit adventures more glamorous than those actually experienced by most reporters. She said in a 1986 article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', "I used to get letters from girl reporters saying that their lives were nowhere near as exciting as Brenda's. I told them that if I made Brenda's life like theirs, nobody would read it."&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''Editor &amp; Publisher''&lt;/ref&gt;

Her break came when she came to the attention of another woman, [[Mollie Slott]],&lt;ref name=Chronicle/&gt; who worked as a "[[Girl Friday (idiom)#Idiom|girl Friday]]" (''à la'' ''[[His Girl Friday]]'') for ''[[New York Daily News]]'' publisher (and syndicate head) [[Joseph Medill Patterson]]. Patterson, reputedly biased against female cartoonists, would not sign her up for daily publication in the ''News'',&lt;ref name=Chronicle/&gt; but he accepted ''Brenda Starr, Reporter'' for syndication as a [[Sunday strip|Sunday comic]], and it made its debut on June 30, 1940. The strip was an immediate success, since the mix of adventure and romance was popular with both male and female readers. By 1945, the strip was syndicated nationally and published daily.

Messick stopped drawing the strip in 1980 and ended her role writing the script two years later. [[Ramona Fradon]] (artist) and Linda Sutter (writer) took over production of the strip. [[Mary Schmich]] took over as writer in 1985, and [[June Brigman]] as artist in 1995. The final strip was published on January 2, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Stop the Presses: ‘Brenda Starr, Reporter’ Comic Is Ending|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/stop-the-presses-brenda-starr-reporter-comic-is-ending/|date=December 9, 2010|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messick was not impressed with her successors' versions of Starr, according to a 1998 quote in the ''Sonoma County Independent'': "Now it doesn't look like Brenda at all. She looks more like she works at a bank. No glamour, no curves, no fashion &amp;mdash; but it's still going pretty good.".&lt;ref name=Howell&gt;{{cite news|last= Howell|first= Daedalus|url= http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/02.19.98/comics-9807.html|title= Brenda Starr's Dale Messick is a firecracker|work= [[Sonoma County Independent]]|location= California|date= February 19–25, 1998|publisher= [[Metro Publishing]]|accessdate= July 11, 2017|archivedate= January 29, 2013|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130129030502/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/02.19.98/comics-9807.html|deadurl= no|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Other endeavors==
Messick worked on other comic strips, but none achieved the success of ''Brenda Starr, Reporter''. The only other strip which she worked on which is generally remembered was ''[[Perry Mason]]'', which she illustrated.

On April 24, 1955, she appeared on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' After [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] correctly identified her as a comic strip artist, the panel was given a full description of her real name, professional name and job as "illustrator" of ''Brenda Starr, Reporter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEXL3d1RKBk |title=What's My Line? - Rosemary Clooney|date= April 24, 1955|publisher=The ''[[What's My Line?]]'' Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accolades==
In 1995, ''Brenda Starr, Reporter'' was one of 20 comic strips honored by a series of United States [[postage stamp]]s; Messick was the only living creator. She received the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Story Comic Book Award for 1975 and their [[Milton Caniff]] Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997 for her work on ''Brenda Starr, Reporter''.&lt;ref name=Post/&gt;

==Personal life==
Messick was married twice. With first husband, Everett George, she had one child, a daughter named Starr. Messick later married attorney Oscar Strom.&lt;ref name=Chronicle /&gt; Both marriages ended in divorce.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

Following her retirement from ''Brenda Starr, Reporter'', Messick moved to Oakmont, California, to be near her daughter and grandchildren.&lt;ref name=Chronicle/&gt; She continued to work, creating a strip, ''Granny Glamour'', which ran in ''Oakmont Gardens Magazine'', a local weekly magazine.&lt;ref name=Howell/&gt; It ended after she had a stroke in 1998 and could not draw any more.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/08/arts/design/dale-messick-98-creator-of-brenda-starr-strip-dies.html |title=Dale Messick, creator of Brenda Starr strip, dies at 98|last=Severo|first= Richard|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= April 8,  2005|accessdate=July 11, 2017| archivedate= November 8, 2015| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151108231418/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/08/arts/design/dale-messick-98-creator-of-brenda-starr-strip-dies.html|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end she was being cared for by her daughter in [[Penngrove, California|Penngrove, Sonoma County, California]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Messick died on April 5, 2005, in [[Sonoma County, California]].&lt;ref name=Chronicle /&gt;
