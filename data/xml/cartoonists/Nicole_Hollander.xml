'''Nicole Hollander''' (born April 25, 1939) is an American cartoonist and writer. Her [[daily strip|daily comic strip]] ''[[Sylvia (comic strip)|Sylvia]]'' was syndicated to newspapers nationally by [[Tribune Media Services]].

== Biography ==
[[File:Sylvia lots of happy fat women.jpeg|thumb|alt=Example of Sylvia cartoon strip|360px|Nicole Hollander's ''Sylvia'' from ''The Whole Enchilada'' (1982)]]
Born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], Hollander was the daughter of Shirley Mazur Garrison and Henry Garrison, a labor activist and member of the carpenters union. Growing up in a working-class Chicago neighborhood, she was educated in Chicago public schools. She earned a B.F.A. from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1960 and an M.F.A. from [[Boston University]] in 1966. Her marriage to Hungarian sociologist Paul Hollander ended in a 1962 divorce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jiffynotes.com/a_study_guides/book_notes/aww_02/aww_02_00567.html Beyer, Janet M. ''Jiffy Notes: Nicole Hollander, 2000''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.forward.com/the-arty-semite/129274/#ixzz1Qf4PF7H0 Ivry, Benjamin. "Who Is Sylvia? What Is She?" ''The Arty Semite'', July 8, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badgirlchats.com/nicole-hollander-long-dinner/ Hollander, Nicole.

During the 1970s, she was the graphic designer of a feminist publication, ''The Spokeswoman'', where she had the opportunity to transform the newsletter into a monthly magazine. While designing pages, she occasionally added her own political illustrations. "Around 1978,"&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, Nicole. ''The Whole Enchilada,'' p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; she created a comic strip, ''The Feminist Funnies'', later introducing the character who became Sylvia. Selections from ''The Feminist Funnies'' appeared as a calendar, ''Witches, Pigs and Fairy Godmothers: The 1978 Feminist Funnies Appointment Calendar'', and in her 1979 book, ''I'm in Training to Be Tall and Blonde''. The book's success led [[Field Newspaper Syndicate]] to distribute ''Sylvia'' to newspapers as a daily [[comic strip]] starting in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thelantern.com/1998/08/sylvia-makes-an-exclusive-stop-at-osu/ Power, Amy.

''Jiffy Notes: Nicole Hollander, 2000''.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Hollander drew comics for ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine. Many of these did not include the Sylvia character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badgirlchats.com/blast-imother-jonesi-magazines/ Hollander, Nicole. "A Blast from Mother Jones Magazine's Past"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollander has donated the archive of her work to the [[Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum]] at [[Ohio State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McGirk |first1=Caitlin |title=Spotlight on the Nicole Hollander Collection |url=https://library.osu.edu/blogs/cartoons/2018/08/01/spotlight-on-the-nicole-hollander-collection/ |website=Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum Blog |accessdate=10 August 2018 |date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of her drawings are in the collection of the [[Library of Congress]]. She is a faculty member at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], in 2011 offering a course in writing the [[graphic novel]]. She has led workshops and taught at [[Ohio State University]], [[Columbia College Chicago]], the Ox-Bow School of Art, Chicago's Printers Row Lit Fest, and for the [http://www.capeweb.org/ Chicago Arts Partnership in Education]. Her frequent appearances as a public speaker since 2001 have occurred at [[The New School]], [[Loyola University Chicago]], [[DePaul University]], the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]], the [[Library of Congress]], [http://www.stagebridge.org/ Stagebridge], and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Hollander, Nicole. Professional résumé.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Hollander curated a show of women's humor, ''And You Think This Is Funny?'', for Chicago's Woman Made Gallery; the show included the work of some 50 women artists. The gallery's simultaneous ten-year retrospective exhibit of Hollander's work was titled ''It's Enough to Make a Cat Laugh.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicagoist.com/2009/01/23/an_interview_with_nicole_hollander.php/ An Interview with Nicole Hollander, ''Chicagoist,'' January 23, 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203174549/http://chicagoist.com/2009/01/23/an_interview_with_nicole_hollander.php |date=February 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womanmade.org/ Woman Made Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Nicole Hollander's "unique collection of condom packages and sex toys" entered the collection of the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badgirlchats.com/condom-collection/ Hollander, Nicole. "The Condom Collection"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Hollander appeared in a one-woman show, ''Return to Lust'', at Pegasus Players in Chicago. A second show, ''Plastic Surgery or a Real Good Haircut'', opened in 2008 at Chicago's Live Bait Theatre. In these performances, she described her experiences as an aging woman dealing with physical vanity, sexual desire and an overlong birthday-party guest list.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.chicagoreader.com/chicago/return-to-lust/Content?oid=920732/ Reid, Kerry.

"Plastic Surgery or a Real Good Haircut?" ''Chicago Reader''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
On March 26. 2012, Hollander announced that she was retiring her ''Sylvia'' strip from newspaper syndication.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.badgirlchats.com/sylvia-nicole-announcement/&lt;/ref&gt; She plans to continue posting archival strips on her blog—"many of them, unfortunately, are as relevant now as they were then"—with occasional new strips.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2012/03/28/nicole-hollander-eases-up-a-little/ Miner, Michael. "Nicole Hollander eases up a little" ''Chicago Reader''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Hollander has published 19 ''Sylvia'' collections, including ''The Whole Enchilada'' (1982), ''[[Tales from the Planet Sylvia]]'' (1990), with an introduction by [[Barbara Ehrenreich]], and ''The Sylvia Chronicles: 30 Years of Graphic Misbehavior from Reagan to Obama'' (2010), with an introduction by [[Jules Feiffer]]. She is the author of ''Tales of Graceful Aging from the Planet Denial'' (2007) and the illustrator of many books by other writers, including children's books by [[Robie Harris]] and books in praise of cats by Allia Zobel.

With Skip Morrow and Ron Wolin, Hollander edited ''Drawn Together: Relationships Lampooned, Harpooned, &amp; Cartooned'' (Crown, 1983) for the Cartoonists Guild. Her work was included in the satirical pro-choice comic book ''Choices'' (Angry Isis Press, 1990) alongside such fellow contributors as [[Howard Cruse]], [[Jules Feiffer]], [[Bill Griffith]], [[Cathy Guisewite]], [[Bill Koeb]], [[Lee Marrs]], [[Nina Paley]] and [[Garry Trudeau]]. [[Gina Barreca]] and Nicole Hollander collaborated on ''An ABC of Vice: An Insatiable Woman's Guide'' (Bibliopola Press, 2003), which combines Barreca's text and Hollander's cartoons. Hollander's cartoons are featured on the covers and in the text of ''Getting in Touch with Your Inner Bitch'' (Hysteria, 1994) and ''The Inner Bitch: Guide to Men, Relationships, Dating, Etc.'' (Hysteria, 1999), by Elizabeth Hilts.

==Critical reception==
* "Nicole Hollander has been one of our nation's leading satirists. This means she is in the business of telling the truth and making it funny... She is a radical social critic who is certain that nothing works, and so what?" ([[Jules Feiffer]], Introduction to ''The Sylvia Chronicles'')
* "What working commentator can confront Sylvia's range of subject matter—from macro-economics to stretch marks, from foreign policy to kitty litter—without gnawing anxiously on his or her writing instrument?... her supernatural insight into matters of public policy, her ability to see, as with x-ray vision, through the stupefying drone of media rhetoric." ([[Barbara Ehrenreich]], Introduction to ''Tales from the Planet Sylvia'')
* "There are precious few women cartoonists, and Nicole is the only one with a daily strip who presents the believable struggles of women in contemporary society." ([[Sara Paretsky]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.forward.com/the-arty-semite/129274/#ixzz1Qf4PF7H0 Ivry, Benjamin. "Who Is Sylvia? What Is She?" The Arty Semite, July 8, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Many [respondents to a reader survey] who voted for Mr. Boffo did so simply to vote against Sylvia. Several claimed they would have voted for a blank space. Their message: Get rid of Sylvia." (''Providence Journal'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/projo/access/580563091.html?dids=580563091:580563091&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+17%2C+1990&amp;author=JACK+MAJOR+Journal-Bulletin+Features+Editor&amp;pub=The+Providence+Journal&amp;desc=The+big+news+about+the+comics+page&amp;pqatl=google/ "The Big News About the Comics Page," ''Providence Journal'', December 17, 1990.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* "The unofficial cartoonist laureate of women’s studies programs around the country... Her cartoons allow us to track the shifting landscape of right-versus-left politics that brought us to where we are now." (Audrey Bilger)&lt;ref&gt;[http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2010/07/09/sylvia-says-what-nicole-hollander-couldnt/ "Sylvia Says What Nicole Hollander Can't," ''MS. blog,'' July 9, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Sylvia...is the mother who lets you swear and talk about sex. She is the friend who advises you to hold the emerald eyeshadow until after dark. She is the sister who appreciates vasectomy humor." (Susan Swartz)&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1aVVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pkANAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1110,4167127&amp;dq=nicole-hollander&amp;hl=en/ "Sylvia Character All Dolled Up; Now You Can Buy a Best Friend," ''The Palm Beach Post'', November 26, 1988.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The comic strip equivalent of TV's ''[[Hazel (comic strip)|Hazel]]''." (G.J.Angelo)&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kIRIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pW8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3711,6110115&amp;dq=nicole-hollander&amp;hl=en/ "Bring Back the Fuscos," ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,'' April 25, 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt;
