'''Michael Leunig''' (born 2 June 1945), typically referred to as '''Leunig''' (his signature on his cartoons), is an Australian [[cartoonist]], poet and cultural commentator. His best known works include ''The Adventures of Vasco Pyjama'' and the ''Curly Flats'' series. He was declared an [[Australian Living Treasures|Australian Living Treasure]] by the [[National Trust of Australia]] in 1999.

== Life and career ==
Leunig, a fifth generation Australian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1001 Australians You Should Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqtinbjO0oEC&amp;pg=PT157&amp;dq=Michael+Leunig+fifth+generation#v=onepage&amp;q=Michael%20Leunig%20fifth%20generation&amp;f=false|publisher=Pluto Press Australia]|accessdate=13 December 2013|author=Toby Creswell, Samantha Trenoweth|date=1 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[East Melbourne, Victoria|East Melbourne]] and grew up in [[Footscray, Victoria|Footscray]], an inner western suburb, where he went to Footscray North Primary School.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.leunig.com.au/index.php/about/biography|work=Leunig.com.au website|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to [[Maribyrnong College|Maribyrnong High School]] but as the school had not finished being built, he first had to attend classes held at the nearby [[Royal Melbourne Showgrounds]] in Ascot Vale.&lt;ref name="TAbunghole"&gt;{{cite web|title=Education and the bunghole of life|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/michael-leunig/education-and-the-bunghole-of-life/2008/02/08/1202234140168.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=13 December 2013|author=Michael Leunig|date= 9, 20 February}}&lt;/ref&gt; He failed his final year examinations, twice.&lt;ref name="TAbunghole" /&gt;

After working as a labourer in an abattoir,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood and guts, violence and death|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/blood-and-guts-violence-and-death/2007/01/11/1168105114893.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=13 December 2013|author=Michael Leunig|date=13 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leunig enrolled at the [[Swinburne University of Technology|Swinburne Film and Television School]] where he was at first interested in making documentaries. He was conscripted in the [[Vietnam War]] call-up, but he registered as a [[conscientious objector]]; in the event, he was rejected on health grounds when it was revealed that he was deaf in one ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lest we forget|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/lest-we-forget/2006/10/12/1160246257830.html?page=fullpage|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=13 December 2013|author=Michael Leunig|date=14 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leunig began his cartoon career while at Swinburne in 1965&lt;ref&gt;Gravett, Paul, ''1001 Comics You Should Read Before You Die'', Universe, 2011, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; when his cartoons appeared in the [[Monash University]] student newspaper ''[[Lot's Wife (student newspaper)|Lot's Wife]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leunig, Michael (1945–) – People and organisations|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/498419?q=creator%3A%22Leunig%2C+Michael%2C+1945-%22&amp;c=people|work=Trove|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s his work appeared in the radical/satirical magazines ''[[Nation Review]]'', ''[[The Digger (alternative magazine)|The Digger]]'' and London's ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' magazine as well as mainstream publications including ''[[Newsday]]'' and ''[[Woman's Day]]''.

The main outlet for Leunig's work has been the daily Fairfax press, Melbourne's ''[[The Age]]'' and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''. In more recent years he has focused mainly on political commentary, sometimes substituting his simple drawings with reproduced photographic images with speech balloons attached. The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] has also provided airtime to Leunig to discuss his views on a range of political and philosophical issues.

=== Family ===
Leunig's first marriage, to Pamela Munro, ended in divorce. He married his second wife, Helga, in 1992. His four children were all born on notable dates: Gus on [[Guy Fawkes Day]] 1974; Sunny on [[Valentine's Day]] 1977; Minna on [[Australia Day]] 1992 and Felix on [[Christmas Day]] 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rewind|journal=''Sunday Life'' magazine [[The Sunday Age]]|date=16 December 2007|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His sister, [[Mary Leunig]] (b. 1950), is also an accomplished cartoonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.maryleunig.com/|work=maryleunig.com website|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cartoons ==
Leunig's drawings are done with a sparse and quivering line, usually in black and white with [[ink|ink wash]], the human characters always drawn with exaggerated noses. This style served him well in his early years when he gained a loyal following for his quirky take on social issues. He also made increasingly frequent forays into a personal fantasy world of whimsy, featuring small figures with teapots balanced on their heads, grotesquely curled hair and many ducks.

Leunig has frequently satirised concepts such as [[Americanisation]], greed, consumerism, corporations and warmongering, in a personal proclamation against the [[War on Terror]]. Of particular note were his parodies of political matters, especially those concerning former Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] and former American president [[George W. Bush]]. This has earned Leunig the description of "political cartoonist",&lt;ref name="wsws"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zionists witch-hunt Australia's leading cartoonist|url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2006/02/leun-f23.html|work=World Socialist Web Site|accessdate=13 December 2013|author=Richard Phillips|date=23 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is misleading as only some of his works are political in nature or reference.

His work has also frequently explored spiritual and religious themes.

=== Controversial works ===
[[Image:Michael Leunig.jpg|thumb|Michael Leunig speaks at a demonstration in [[Melbourne]] against [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict|Israel's military action in Gaza]], 2009]]

In 2008, Leunig wrote that "Artists must never shrink from a confrontation with society or the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art from the heart|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/michael-leunig/art-from-the-heart/2008/06/05/1212259005269.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=13 December 2013|author=Michael Leunig|date=7 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His cartoons have occasionally been a source of controversy. Between 1995 and 2000 he drew the ire of "working mothers" by satirising the heavy reliance upon childcare services in Australian culture in several of his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Care...|url=http://www.cartoonists.com.au/cartoonists-articles/2000/4/29/all-care/|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=13 December 2013|author=[[Bettina Arndt]]|date=29 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leunig's opposition to the 2003 [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], although in line with over three-quarters of the Australian populace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australian PM censured over Iraq|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2727551.stm|work=BBC News website|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 December 2013|date=5 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew some criticism in the press.  He commented that "...if a cartoonist is representing the government line on Iraq, they're nothing better than a propagandist."&lt;ref name="wsws" /&gt;

In 2006, [[Fairfax Media]] censored a cartoon in [[New South Wales]] but not in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], which criticised the then-Prime Minister, [[John Howard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leunig and Good Taste|url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1650231.htm|work=[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=13 December 2013|date=29 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leunig has also stated his opposition to the Israeli government and three of his 2004 – 2006 pieces drew letters of protest nationally and internationally in relation to this.  The three pieces took as their subjects: [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] bomber pilots (13 April 2004); [[Sheikh Ahmed Yassin]]'s assassination order from [[Ariel Sharon]] (11 January 2006); and the renewed [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] occupation (12 July 2006). A fourth piece was refused publication and has since been more widely criticised for potentially confounding his opposition to the policies of Israel, with an antisemitic, generalised subversion of the Jewish experience, by relying upon a reference to the Jewish Holocaust.  This piece came to international attention after it won an Iranian competition conceived by the newspaper ''[[Hamshahri]]'' as retaliation for the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Muhammad cartoons controversy]].  Leunig denied he had submitted the cartoon as an entry to the competition and said "I've been set up horribly, maliciously".&lt;ref name="BBChoax"&gt;{{cite news|title=Australian in Iran cartoon 'hoax'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4711504.stm|work=BBC news website|accessdate=13 December 2013|date=14 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He demanded the cartoons be withdrawn, which the newspaper did and also apologised to him.&lt;ref name="BBChoax" /&gt; It later emerged that the cartoon had been submitted as a prank by a web contributor to the Australian comedic team ''[[The Chaser (newspaper)|The Chaser]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaser behind Leunig stunt|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/chaser-behind-leunig-stunt/2006/02/15/1139890807095.html|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=13 December 2013|author=Justin Norrie|date=16 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leunig has partially defined his position with this statement:
{{cquote|I have a Jewish friend, a Holocaust survivor, who says that she never could have lived in Israel because in her view it is a totalitarian state.... I believe that something fundamental and vital, not just to Israel but to the entire world, has been gravely mishandled by the present Israeli administration and it bothers me deeply. It is my right to express it.&lt;ref name="wsws" /&gt;|20px|20px|Michael Leunig | 13 January 2006, The Age}}

==Characters and themes==

In the series of cartoons that Leunig has created over the duration of his career, a number of characters have persisted.

* ''The Duck'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Croggon, Alison | title=My life with a duck. -Cartoonist Michael Leunig- | journal=Bulletin (Sydney) | publication-date=1991-04-02 | issue=2 Apr 1991 | pages=98–99 | issn=1440-7485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Mr Curly'' is one character that has regularly appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Holland, Angus | title=Mr Curly comes clean. -Inside the Michael Leunig asylum.- | journal=Sydney Weekly | publication-date=21 | issue=21-27 Nov 1995 | pages=12–15 | issn=1324-3993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also Leunig has from a very early stage in his career, included verse within his cartoons,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Leunig, Michael | title=Michael Leunig: poetry in pictures. -Interview conducted by Ewins, Rory- | journal=Togatus | publication-date=1987-10 | volume=58 | issue=8 | pages=16–19 | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/39145266 | accessdate=27 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently he has also published books of poetry.

Leunig has also been very open about his themes in interviews about his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Leunig, Michael | title=Michael Leunig, a very unpretentious man. -Interview- | journal=Lot's Wife | publication-date=1991-05-06 | volume=21 (i.e. v.31) | issue=6 | pages=12–14 | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/39102856 | accessdate=27 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Leunig, Michael | title=Making a cartoon: despair, chaos ... and the clock keeps ticking. - Interview with Michael Leunig by O'Connor, Peter- | journal=Temenos (Canberra) | publication-date=1995 | issue=1 | pages=19–22 | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/39040814 | accessdate=27 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Leunig, Michael | title=A Leunig kind of thing [For more than 30 years Michael Leunig has presented his unique cartoon vision of the human condition.

== Celebrity and tribute ==
Leunig was declared one of [[Australian Living Treasures]] by the [[National Trust of Australia]] in 1999.

Melbourne, his hometown, has taken him into their hearts. Not only has there been a [[Trams in Melbourne|Leunig tram]] but Leunig featured strongly in the [[2006 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2006 Commonwealth Games|2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games]]. In this performance, the philosophical and mystical nature of his work was on display. It featured a "boy and his duck" and the boy's dreams and visions. Leunig was heard reading a stanza of his poem as a voice-over.

Leunig was also the creator of a popular [[iGoogle#Themes|iGoogle theme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iGoogle Artist Themes – Michael Leunig|url=http://www.google.com.au/help/ig/art/artists/leunig.html|accessdate=13 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215181213/http://www.google.com.au/help/ig/art/artists/leunig.html|archivedate=15 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Metrosideros leunigii]]'', the oldest described fossil species of the flowering plant genus Metrosideros, was named after Leunig.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite journal |last1=Tarran |first1=Myall| last2=Wilson| first2=Peter| last3=Hill| first3=Robert| title=Oldest record of Metrosideros (Myrtaceae): Fossil flowers, fruits, and leaves from Australia.| journal=American Journal of Botany| date=2016| volume=103| issue=4| pages=754–768| url=http://www.amjbot.org/content/103/4/754.abstract |subscription=yes | doi=10.3732/ajb.1500469 | pmid=27056926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration with Gyan===
In 2006 Australian musician [[Gyan Evans]] released the album ''[[Billy the Rabbit]]'' which was based on the poetry of Leunig.  Gyan and Leunig launched the album at the [[Melbourne Writers Festival]] with Leunig illustrating during Gyan's singing.  They also performed together at the [[Byron Bay Writers' Festival]] and the [[Sydney Opera House]].

According to Gyan:

{{cquote|It came about through a complete labour of love. I set a lot of his poetry to music over the space of a year without really knowing what I was doing. I had no motive, no plan. A friend of mine knew him and I contacted him at [[The Age]] and sent it to him, he fell madly in love with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gyan and Mr Curly|url=http://echo.net.au/archives/19_10/pdf/p22.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831065850/http://echo.net.au/archives/19_10/pdf/p22.pdf|archivedate=2006-08-31|work=The Echo – Echonetdaily|accessdate=13 December 2013|page=2|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
