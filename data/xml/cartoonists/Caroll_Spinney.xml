'''Caroll Edwin Spinney''' (born December 26, 1933) is an American puppeteer, cartoonist, author and speaker most famous for playing [[Big Bird]] and [[Oscar the Grouch]] on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' since 1969. He is usually credited as '''Caroll Spinney''' but has sometimes been credited using the alternate spelling ''Carroll Spinney'' or under the name '''Ed Spinney'''.

==Early life==
Caroll Edwin Spinney was born in [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], [[Massachusetts]] on December 26, 1933. His mother, a native of [[Bolton]], [[England]], named him Caroll because he was born the day after Christmas. He has been drawing and painting since he was a child. He developed a love of puppeteering when he saw a performance of [[Three Little Kittens]] at the age of five. This motivated him to purchase a monkey puppet from a [[jumble sale|rummage sale]] three years later and put on a puppet show utilizing the monkey and a plush snake. The following Christmas his mother gifted him with a [[Punch and Judy]] puppet theater. He continued puppeteering throughout his childhood and adolescence and used his performances to raise money for college tuition.&lt;ref&gt;Spinney, Caroll. ''The Wisdom of Big Bird (and the Dark Genius of Oscar the Grouch)'', pages 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

After he graduated from [[Acton-Boxborough Regional High School]] in [[Acton, Massachusetts]], Spinney served in the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]].&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1249919|title=A Life Inside Big Bird|publisher=National Public Radio|date=May 5, 2003|accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Comics and cartoons===
While in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], Spinney wrote and illustrated ''[[Harvey (comic strip)|Harvey]]'', a [[comic strip]] about military life. He also animated a series of black-and-white [[cartoon]]s called ''[[Crazy Crayon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I AM BIG BIRD: Exclusive CRAZY CRAYON|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAAgch5swvQ|website=YouTube|publisher=Copper Pot Pictures|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early puppeteering===
In 1955, Spinney relocated to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], where he performed in the show ''Rascal Rabbit''.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; He returned to [[Boston]], joining ''The Judy and Goggle Show'' in 1958 as a [[puppeteer]] "Goggle" to [[Judy Valentine]]'s Judy. Throughout the 1960s, he performed on the Boston broadcast of ''[[Bozo the Clown|Bozo's Big Top]]'', where he played various costumed characters which included Kookie the Boxing Kangaroo as well as Mr. Lion, who created [[cartoon]] drawings from the names of children participating in the show. Through that decade, he was also a commercial artist and animator.

Spinney created a puppet duo consisting of two cats named Picklepuss and Pop, which he utilized throughout the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Spinney, Caroll. ''The Wisdom of Big Bird (and the Dark Genius of Oscar the Grouch)'', pages 18-19 ({{ISBN|0-375-50781-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Many years later, Spinney's Picklepuss and Pop puppets were characters in ''Wow, You're a Cartoonist!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Art of Caroll Spinney Comes to Pittsburgh|url=http://www.toughpigs.com/art-of-spinney-pittsburgh/|website=Tough Pigs|accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a ''Sesame Street'' Muppeteer===
[[File:Carroll Spinney and Oscar the Grouch 2014.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Spinney with [[Oscar the Grouch]], May 2014]]
Spinney first met [[Jim Henson]] in 1962 at a puppeteering festival, where Henson asked if he would like to "talk about the [[The Muppets|Muppets]]". As Spinney failed to realize the question was an employment offer, the conversation never came to pass.&lt;ref&gt;Spinney, Caroll. ''The Wisdom of Big Bird (and the Dark Genius of Oscar the Grouch)'', page 24 ({{ISBN|0-375-50781-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Spinney performed at a [[Puppeteers of America]] festival in [[Utah]]. His show was a mixture of live actors and puppets but was ruined by an errant spotlight that washed out the animated backgrounds. Henson was once again in attendance and noticed Spinney's performance. "I liked what you were trying to do," Henson said, and he asked once more if they could "talk about the Muppets". This time, they did have the conversation, and Spinney joined the Muppeteers full-time by late 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, Kathy; Horiuchi, Vince. "Q is for 'quiz': Celebrating 40 years of 'Sesame Street'". ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', November 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinney joined ''[[Sesame Street]]'' for the inaugural season in 1969. However, he nearly left after the first season because he was not getting acceptable pay, but [[Kermit Love]] persuaded him to stay.&lt;ref&gt;Spinney, Caroll. ''The Wisdom of Big Bird (and the Dark Genius of Oscar the Grouch)'', pages 63-65 ({{ISBN|0-375-50781-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt; He has performed the Big Bird and Oscar characters in [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I AM BIG BIRD: Exclusive OSCAR IN AUSTRALIA|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klA6NmAHiOc|website=YouTube|publisher=Copper Pot Pictures|accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;Spinney, Caroll. ''The Wisdom of Big Bird (and the Dark Genius of Oscar the Grouch)'', pages 82-83; 88 ({{ISBN|0-375-50781-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]], and across [[Europe]]. As Big Bird and Oscar, he has conducted orchestras across the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]], including the [[Boston Pops Orchestra|Boston Pops]], as well as visited the [[White House]] multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/11/nyregion/public-lives-30-happy-years-as-an-8-foot-tall-yellow-bird.html|title=30 Years as an 8&amp;nbsp;foot bird |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has provided the characters' voices on dozens of albums.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

As Oscar, Spinney has written ''How to Be a Grouch'', a [[Western Publishing|Whitman Tell-A-Tale]] picture book. With J. Milligan, he wrote the 2003 book ''The Wisdom of Big Bird (and the Dark Genius of Oscar the Grouch): Lessons from a Life in Feathers'' ({{ISBN|0-375-50781-7}}). Spinney narrated the audiobook ''Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street'' by Michael Davis.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Street-Gang-Complete-History-Sesame/dp/1593161409/ref=tmm_abk_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1498886176&amp;sr=8-3&lt;/ref&gt; His work has been studied by other international puppeteers who structure their performance styles after his, most evidently with full-body puppet costumes. The Chinese performer of [[Big Bird|Da Niao]] on ''[[Zhima Jie]]'' is most evident of this, as the character is an exact physical replica of Big Bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I AM BIG BIRD: Exclusive TRAINING CHINESE BIG BIRD|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_YaZmujaO4|website=YouTube|publisher=Copper Pot Pictures|accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Big Bird and Oscar are his main characters, Spinney has also performed as other characters. At one point, he created and performed Bruno the Trash Man, a full-bodied puppet representing a garbage carrier, who also carried [[Sesame Street (fictional location)#Oscar the Grouch's Trash Can|Oscar's trash can]]. Bruno was used until the foam plastic of the character broke down.&lt;ref&gt;Spinney, Caroll. ''The Wisdom of Big Bird (and the Dark Genius of Oscar the Grouch)'', page 62 ({{ISBN|0-375-50781-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinney has performed as [[Granny Bird]], Big Bird's grandmother. The puppet used for Granny Bird is actually a spare Big Bird puppet, and Spinney provides her voice. As Granny Bird's appearances are often alongside Big Bird (who is, as she stated, her "favorite grandson"), her voice is usually pre-recorded so that Spinney can perform Big Bird. Spinney was one of many puppeteers of a Muppet named Baby Monster in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, Michael.

May 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This character was an "anything monster" Muppet played by various Muppeteers until [[Brian Meehl|Brian Muehl]] took over the character in 1980, and the character was given the name [[Elmo]]. The character was taken over by [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]] in 1984 and finally given to [[Kevin Clash]] by Hunt a year later. Spinney reprised his role as Oscar the Grouch in ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]'' in a [[cameo appearance]] next to [[Darth Vader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Night At The Museum 2|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/night-at-the-museum-2/cast/306359/|website=TV Guide.com|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artwork===
Some of his artwork include the 1996 painting called ''[[Luna Bird]]'' showing [[Big Bird]] walking on the [[moon]] and the 1997 painting ''Autumn'', showing him playing in autumn leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carollspinney.com/artist.html |title=Caroll Spinney |publisher=Caroll Spinney |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Spinney has been honored with four [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s for his portrayals on the series and two [[Grammy Award]]s for his related recordings. Two recordings of Spinney's voice have earned [[Music recording sales certification|Gold Record]] status.

At the [[33rd Daytime Emmy Awards]] in 2006, Spinney received the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]]' Lifetime Achievement Award. "I am elated and amazed to receive this honor from those who are committed to the best of what television and media have to offer, for doing what I've always wanted to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emmyonline.com/day_33rd_lifetime|website=emmyonline.com|title=SESAME STREETâ€™S CAROLL SPINNEY, ALTER EGO OF BIG BIRD AND OSCAR TO RECEIVE NATIONAL TELEVISION ACADEMYâ€™S LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD|publisher=The National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
