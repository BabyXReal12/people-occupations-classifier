The ''Compu-toon'' strip ran in approximately 150 newspapers from 1994 until 1997. Boyce is still producing ''Compu-toon'' by way of syndication. [[Universal Uclick|Andrews McMeel Syndicate]] distributes it.

== Career ==

=== The cARToon Exhibit ===
Boyce was a part of the cARToon exhibit at the [[Barrington Area Library]] in January 2007. The show featured a collection of artwork titled the ''Blues Arrangement Exhibit''. According to Boyce, the artwork showed scenes about the blues in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] from the early turn of the century to now by "way of events which he had seen or heard of", and contained portraits of [[List of blues musicians|blues musicians]] in various paintings such as ''Lead Belly'', ''Harmonica Player'', ''Ducks 1'', and ''Ducks 2''.&lt;ref&gt;Insprucker, Mary Jekielek. "Barrington Man's Cartooning Will make You Laugh." Daily Herald Correspondent, 1 Jan 10 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diversity and lack thereof in syndicated cartoons ===
Although there was and still is a lack of diversity within cartoons, there was an increase in cartoonists of color between the years of 1988-1998. In 1988, there was only one cartoonist of color at a large syndicate; ''[[Wee Pals]]'' creator [[Morrie Turner]]. There are several potential causes to this seemingly sudden increase, such as the [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] and [[The Detroit News]] hosting a contest for minority cartoonists as well as there being more focused press space on the issue of diversity. However, despite the increased attention and focus on improving diversity, many minority comic artists have still been rejected from major newspapers based on the fact that the newspaper "already has a minority comic", including comic artists [[Barbara Brandon-Croft|Barbara Brandon]] and [[Ray Billingsley|Rey Billingsley]]. On this topic, Boyce comments that “people are people” and that race has little effect on the enjoyment of a comic; that minority created comics have wide appeal. This is proved by the fact that many cartoonists of color receive fan mail from white readers, as well as the fact that nearly every minority-created comic has continued through 1988-1998, which was an especially impressive rate for the decade.&lt;ref&gt;Astor, David. "Diversity Push Makes the Comics a Little Less White." Editor &amp; Publisher 131.49. 5 December 1998, p. 34-5. Accessed 1 Nov. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protesting through artwork ===
In February 2008, Boyce was involved in a protest which called for a greater representation of black cartoon artists in newspaper comics. The protest sought to bring attention to the problem of “[[tokenism]]” in newspapers, and brings to light the issues that many black comic artists face when trying to publish their works. In addition to Boyce, the artists that participated in the protest were [[Jerry Craft]], [[Charlos Gary]], Steve Watkins, [[Keith Knight (cartoonist)|Keith Knight]], [[Bill Murray (cartoonist)|Bill Murray]], and Tim Jackson. For one day, these cartoonists all drew a very similar comic strip, which showed a scene with a white reader looking at a minority-drawn strip and complaining that it is a rip-off of the [[The Boondocks (comic strip)|''Boondocks'']].&lt;ref&gt;Wiltz, Teresa.
