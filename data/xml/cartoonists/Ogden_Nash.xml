'''Frederic Ogden Nash''' (August 19, 1902 – May 19, 1971) was an American poet well known for his [[Light poetry|light verse]], of which he wrote over 500 pieces. With his unconventional [[rhyme|rhyming schemes]], he was declared the country's best-known producer of humorous poetry.

==Early life==

Nash was born in [[Rye (city), New York|Rye]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the son of Mattie (Chenault) and Edmund Strudwick Nash.&lt;ref name="Lehman2006"&gt;{{cite book|first=David |last=Lehman |title=The Oxford Book of American Poetry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gO0AK7qCvmoC&amp;pg=PA475 |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-516251-6 |page=475}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Mo-Ni/Nash-Ogden.html|title=Ogden Nash Biography - life, family, children, parents, death, school, book, information, born, movie|website=''notablebiographies.com''|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father owned and operated an import–export company, and because of business obligations, the family relocated often. Nash was descended from [[Abner Nash]], an early governor of North Carolina. The city of Nashville, Tennessee, was named for Abner's brother, [[Francis Nash|Francis]], a Revolutionary War general.&lt;ref name="NCHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=NC Highway Markers, printable view|url=http://www.ncmarkers.com/print_marker.aspx?MarkerId=G-10|website=North Carolina Office of Archives and History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Powell|editor1-first=William|title=Dictionary of North Carolina Biography, v4|page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his life, Nash loved to rhyme.  "I think in terms of rhyme, and have since I was six years old," he stated in a 1958 news interview.&lt;ref name="APQuote"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Hal |last=Boyle |title=Ogden Nash Finds Light Verse Doesn't Flow Easy |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zu0KAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3U8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6654,1365475 |agency=Associated Press |work=Prescott Evening Courier |date=December 1, 1958 |accessdate=19 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a fondness for crafting his own words whenever rhyming words did not exist, though admitting that crafting rhymes was not always the easiest task.&lt;ref name="APQuote"/&gt;

His family lived briefly in [[Savannah, Georgia]], in a carriage house owned by [[Juliette Gordon Low]], founder of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]]; he wrote a poem about [[Juliette Gordon Low#Founding the Girl Scouts|Mrs. Low's House]].  After graduating from [[St. George's School, Newport|St. George's School]] in [[Newport County, Rhode Island]], Nash entered [[Harvard University]] in 1920, only to drop out a year later.

He returned as a teacher to St. George's for one year before returning to New York.&lt;ref name="georev"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillips |first=Louis |title=Reviewed work(s): Ogden Nash: The Life and Work of America's Laureate of Light Verse by Douglas M. Parker |journal=The Georgia Review |year=2005 |volume=59 |issue=4 |page=961 |jstor=41402690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he took up selling bonds, about which Nash reportedly quipped, "Came to New York to make my fortune as a bond salesman and in two years sold one bond—to my godmother. However, I saw lots of good movies."&lt;ref name="georev"/&gt; Nash then took a position as a writer of the [[streetcar]] card ads for [[Barron Collier]],&lt;ref name="georev"/&gt; a company that previously had employed another Baltimore resident, [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]. He spent three months in 1931 working on the editorial staff for ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="georev"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hasley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hasley|first=Louis|title=The Golden Trashery of Ogden Nashery|journal=The Arizona Quarterly|year=1971|volume=27|issue=3|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 he married Frances Leonard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baltimoreauthors.ubalt.edu/writers/ogdennash.htm|title=Ogden Nash|website=baltimoreauthors.ubalt.edu|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published his first collection of poems, ''Hard Lines'', that same year, earning him national recognition.&lt;ref name="CbsStamp"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vries|first1=Lloyd|title=Postage Stamp Bash / For Ogden Nash|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/postage-stamp-bash-for-ogden-nash/|accessdate=April 11, 2017|publisher=CBS News|date=July 19, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his poems reflected an anti-establishment feeling. For example, one verse, titled ''Common Sense'', asks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Why did the Lord give us agility,
If not to evade responsibility?&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1934, Nash moved to [[Baltimore]], Maryland, where he remained until his death in 1971. Nash thought of Baltimore as home. After his return from a brief move to New York, he wrote, apropos Richard Lovelace, "I could have loved New York had I not loved Balti-more."

==Writing career==
When Nash wasn't writing poems, he made guest appearances on comedy and radio shows and toured the United States and the United Kingdom, giving lectures at colleges and universities.

Nash was regarded with respect by the literary establishment, and his poems were frequently anthologized even in serious collections such as Selden Rodman's 1946 ''A New Anthology of Modern Poetry.''

Nash was the lyricist for the Broadway musical ''[[One Touch of Venus]]'', collaborating with librettist [[S. J. Perelman]] and composer [[Kurt Weill]]. The show included the notable song "[[Speak Low]]." He also wrote the lyrics for the 1952 [[revue]] ''[[Two's Company (musical)|Two's Company]]''.

Nash and his love of the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] were featured in the December 13, 1968 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Nash | first =Ogden | date =December 13, 1968 | title =My Colts, verses and reverses | journal =[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |volume=65 |issue=24 |pages=75 |ISSN=0024-3019 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=ogden#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=1 August 2014 | format = – &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3ANash+intitle%3AMy+Colts%2C+verses+and+reverses&amp;as_publication=%5B%5BLife+%28magazine%29%7CLife%5D%5D&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; with several poems about the [[American football]] team matched to full-page pictures. Entitled "My Colts, verses and reverses," the issue includes his poems and photographs by Arthur Rickerby.  "Mr. Nash, the league leading writer of light verse (Averaging better than 6.3 lines per carry), lives in Baltimore and loves the Colts," it declares. The comments further describe Nash as "a fanatic of the Baltimore Colts, and a gentleman."  Featured on the magazine cover is defensive player [[Dennis Gaubatz]], number 53, in midair pursuit with this description:  "That is he, looming 10 feet tall or taller above the [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]]' signal caller...Since Gaubatz acts like this on Sunday, I'll do my quarterbacking Monday." Memorable Colts [[Jimmy Orr]], [[Billy Ray Smith Sr.|Billy Ray Smith]], [[Bubba Smith]], [[Willie Richardson]], [[Dick Szymanski]] and [[Lou Michaels]] contribute to the poetry.

Among his most popular writings were a series of animal verses, many of which featured his off-kilter rhyming devices. Examples include "If called by a panther / Don't anther"; "Who wants my jellyfish? / I'm not sellyfish!"; "The one-L lama, he's a priest.  The two-L llama, he's a beast.  And I will bet a silk pajama: there isn't any three-L lllama!". Nash later appended the footnote "  *The author's attention has been called to a type of conflagration known as a three-alarmer. Pooh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wonderingminstrels.blogspot.com/2002/08/lama-ogden-nash.html|title=The Lama – Ogden Nash|website=wonderingminstrels.blogspot.com|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best of his work was published in 14 volumes between 1931 and 1972.

==Death and subsequent events==
Nash died at Baltimore's [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] on May 19, 1971, of complications from [[Crohn's disease]] aggravated by a [[lactobacillus]] infection transmitted by improperly prepared [[coleslaw]].&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt; He is buried in East Side Cemetery in [[North Hampton, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Ogden Nash Letters, 1968–1969|url=https://www.library.unh.edu/find/archives/collections/ogden-nash-letters-1968-1969|publisher=University of New Hampshire|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death in 1971, ''[[The New York Times]]'' said his "droll verse with its unconventional [[rhyme]]s made him the country's best-known producer of humorous poetry."&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Albin |last=Krebs |title=Ogden Nash, Master of Light Verse, Dies |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |quote=Ogden Nash, whose droll verse with its unconventional rhymes made him the country's best-known producer of humorous poetry, died yesterday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. His age was 68. |date=May 20, 1971 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0613FC3954127B93C2AB178ED85F458785F9 |accessdate=24 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A biography, ''Ogden Nash: the Life and Work of America's Laureate of Light Verse'', was written by Douglas M. Parker, published in 2005 and in paperback in 2007. The book was written with the cooperation of the Nash family, and quotes extensively from Nash's personal correspondence as well as his poetry.

His daughter Isabel was married to noted photographer Fred Eberstadt, and his granddaughter, [[Fernanda Eberstadt]], is an acclaimed author. Nash had one other daughter, Linell Nash Smith.

==Poetic style==
Nash was best known for surprising, [[pun]]-like rhymes, sometimes with words deliberately misspelled for comic effect, as in his retort to [[Dorothy Parker]]'s humorous dictum, ''Men seldom make passes / At girls who wear glasses:''

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;A girl who's bespectacled
May not get her nectacled&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this example, the word "nectacled" sounds like the phrase "neck tickled" when rhymed with the previous line.

Sometimes the words rhyme by mispronunciation rather than misspelling, as in:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Farewell, farewell, you old rhinoceros,
I'll stare at something less prepoceros&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another typical example of rhyming by combining words occurs in "The Adventures of Isabel", when Isabel confronts a witch who threatens to turn her into a toad:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;She showed no rage and she showed no rancor,
But she turned the witch into milk, and drank her.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nash often wrote in an exaggerated verse form with pairs of lines that rhyme, but are of dissimilar length and irregular meter:

:Once there was a man named Mr. Palliser and he asked his wife, May I be a gourmet?
:And she said, You sure may.

Nash's poetry was often a playful twist of an old saying or poem. For one example, he expressed this playfulness in what is perhaps his most famous rhyme, a twist on [[Joyce Kilmer]]'s poem [[Trees (poem)|"Trees"]] (1913): "I think that I shall never see / a poem lovely as a tree," which drops "[[billboard]]" in place of poem and adds, "Indeed, unless the billboards fall / I'll never see a tree at all."&lt;ref name="facefamiliar"&gt;Nash, Ogden, "Song of the Open Road, ''The Face Is Familiar'' (Garden City Publishing, 1941), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; That same playfulness produced a number of often quoted quips, including "Progress might have been all right once, but it has gone on too long" and "People who work sitting down get paid more than people who work standing up."

==Other poems==
Nash, a [[baseball]] fan, wrote a poem titled "[[Line-Up for Yesterday]]," an alphabetical poem listing baseball immortals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Tim |last=Wiles |title=Who's on Verse? |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 31, 1996 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/specials/baseball/bbo-baseball-preview-poetry.html |accessdate=23 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20001217013500/http://www.nytimes.com/specials/baseball/bbo-baseball-preview-poetry.html |archivedate = December 17, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in [[Sport (US magazine)|''Sport'' magazine]] in January 1949, the poem pays tribute to the baseball greats and to his own fandom, in alphabetical order. Here is a sampling from his A to Z list:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Baseball Almanac|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_line.shtml|accessdate=23 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;&lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt; is for [[Ty Cobb|Cobb]], Who grew spikes and not corn, And made all the basemen Wish they weren't born.
&lt;u&gt;D&lt;/u&gt; is for [[Dizzy Dean|Dean]], The grammatical Diz, When they asked, Who's the tops? Said correctly, I is.
&lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt; is for [[Johnny Evers|Evers]], His jaw in advance; Never afraid To [[Joe Tinker|Tinker]] with [[Frank Chance|Chance]].
&lt;u&gt;F&lt;/u&gt; is for [[Frankie Frisch|Fordham]] And Frankie and Frisch; I wish he were back With the [[San Francisco Giants#New York Giants history|Giants]], I wish.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nash particularly loved Baltimore sports teams.

Nash wrote humorous poems for each movement of the [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] orchestral suite ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'', which are sometimes recited when the work is performed. The original recording of this version was made by [[Columbia Records]] in the 1940s, with [[Noël Coward]] reciting the poems and [[Andre Kostelanetz]] conducting the orchestra.

He wrote a humorous poem about the [[IRS]] and [[income tax]] titled ''Song for the Saddest Ides'', a reference to March 15, the [[ides (calendar)|ides]] of March, when federal taxes were due at the time.  It was later set to music and performed by the IRS Chorale until its composer/conductor's later retirement.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Many of his poems, reflecting the times in which they were written, presented [[ethnic stereotype|stereotypes of]] different nationalities. For example, in ''Genealogical Reflections'' he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;No McTavish
Was ever Lavish&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Japanese'' published in 1938, Nash presents an allegory for the expansionist policies of the Empire of Japan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;How courteous is the Japanese;
He always says, "Excuse it, please."
He climbs into his neighbor’s garden,
And smiles, and says, "I beg your pardon";
He bows and grins a friendly grin,
And calls his hungry family in;
He grins, and bows a friendly bow;
"So sorry, this my garden now."&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Ogden. ''I'm a Stranger Here Myself'' (Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1938), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He published some poems for children, including "The Adventures of Isabel", which begins: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Isabel met an enormous bear,
Isabel, Isabel, didn't care;
The bear was hungry, the bear was ravenous,
The bear's big mouth was cruel and cavernous.
The bear said, "Isabel, glad to meet you,
How do, Isabel, now I'll eat you!"
Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry.
Isabel didn't scream or scurry.
She washed her hands and she straightened her hair up,
Then Isabel quietly ate the bear up.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Postage stamp==
The [[US Postal Service]] released a postage stamp featuring Ogden Nash and text from six of his poems on the centennial of his birth on August 19, 2002. The six poems are "The Turtle", "The Cow", "Crossing The Border", "The Kitten", "The Camel", and "Limerick One". It was the first stamp in the history of the USPS to include the word "sex", although as a synonym for gender.&lt;ref name="CbsStamp" /&gt; It can be found under the "O" and is part of "The Turtle".  The stamp is the eighteenth in the Literary Arts section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2008/sr08_015.htm |publisher=U. S.
