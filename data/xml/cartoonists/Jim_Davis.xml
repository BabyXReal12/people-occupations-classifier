'''James Robert Davis''' (born July 28, 1945) is an [[United States|American]] [[cartoonist]], best known as the creator of the [[comic strip]]s ''[[Garfield]]'' and ''[[U.S. Acres]]'' (a.k.a. ''Orson's Farm''). Published since 1978, ''Garfield'' is one of the world's most widely syndicated comic strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/stories/2002/01/28/daily4.html|title=Garfield comic strip makes Guinness Book of World Records |website=[[bizjournals]]|date=2002-01-28|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis's other comics work includes ''[[Tumbleweeds (comic strip)|Tumbleweeds]]'', ''[[Gnorm Gnat]]'' and ''[[Mr. Potato Head]]''.

Davis wrote or co-wrote all of the ''Garfield'' TV specials for [[CBS]], originally broadcast between 1982 and 1991. He also produced the ''[[Garfield &amp; Friends]]'' Saturday Morning series, which aired on the channel from 1988 to 1994. Davis was the writer and executive producer for a series of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] direct-to-video feature films about Garfield, as well as an executive producer for the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animated TV series ''[[The Garfield Show]]''.

==Personal life==
Jim Davis was born in [[Marion, Indiana]] on July 28, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Weyer |first1=Geert |title=100 stripklassiekers die niet in je boekenkast mogen ontbreken |year=2008 |publisher=Atlas |location=[[Amsterdam]] / [[Antwerp]] |language=Dutch |isbn=978-90-450-0996-4 &lt;!--|page=214--&gt; |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis grew up on a small farm in [[Fairmount, Indiana]], with his father James William "Jim" Davis, mother Anna Catherine "Betty" (née Carter) Davis, brother Dave and 25 [[cat]]s. Davis's childhood on a farm parallels the life of Garfield's owner, [[Jon Arbuckle]], who was also raised on a farm with his parents and a brother, Doc Boy. Jon is a cartoonist, who also celebrates his birthday on July 28. Davis attended [[Ball State University]] where he studied [[art]] and [[business]]. While attending Ball State, he became a member of the [[Theta Xi]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]].

Unlike the bachelor, Jon Arbuckle, Davis has been married twice, first to Carolyn (Altekruse), who was allergic to cats,&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;"Those Catty Cartoonists,"  ''Time'' magazine, Dec. 07, 1981; available online at [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953256-1,00.html Time magazine] website.&lt;/ref&gt; though they owned a dog named Molly.&lt;ref name="everything2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=Jim+Davis|title=Jim Davis - Everything2.com|website=everything2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a son, James Alexander Davis.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/523/000023454/ NNDB profile]. Retrieved March 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 16, 2000, Davis married his current wife, Jill, and had two more children: Ashley and Christopher.&lt;ref name="everything2"/&gt;

In the fall of 2016 Jim Davis joined the faculty of Ball State University in Muncie as an adjunct professor.

Davis resides in [[Albany, Indiana]], where he and his staff produce ''Garfield'' under his [[Paws, Inc.]] company, launched in 1981. Paws, Inc. employs nearly 50 artists and licensing administrators, who work with agents around the world managing Garfield's vast licensing, syndication, and entertainment empire.

Davis is a former president of the Fairmount, Indiana [[National FFA Organization|FFA]] chapter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ffa.org/documents/about_prominentmembers.pdf "National FFA Organization Prominent Members"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713074526/http://www.ffa.org/documents/about_prominentmembers.pdf |date=2010-07-13 }}, National F.F.A. Organization (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Prior to creating Garfield, Davis worked for an advertising agency, and in 1969, he began assisting Tom Ryan's comic strip, ''[[Tumbleweeds (comic strip)|Tumbleweeds]]''. He then created a comic strip, ''[[Gnorm Gnat]]'', that ran for five years in ''The Pendleton Times'', an [[Indiana]] newspaper. When Davis attempted to sell it to a national comic strip [[syndicate]], an editor told him: "Your art is good, your gags are great, but bugs—nobody can relate to bugs!"&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Jim. ''20 Years &amp; Still Kicking!: Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection''. New York: Ballantine Books, 1998, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 1978, ''Garfield'' started syndication in 41 newspapers. Today it is syndicated in 2,580 newspapers and is read by approximately 300 million readers every day.&lt;ref name="BW1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Garfield Named World's Most Syndicated Comic Strip. |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2002_Jan_22/ai_82001296 |accessdate=July 26, 2008 |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |date=January 22, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121005601/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2002_Jan_22/ai_82001296 |archivedate=January 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Davis created the barnyard slapstick comic strip ''U.S. Acres''. Outside the U.S., the strip was known as ''Orson's Farm''. Davis, along with Brett Koth, also made a 2000–03 strip based on the [[Mr. Potato Head]] toy.

Davis founded the Professor Garfield Foundation to support children's literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professorgarfield.org/parents_teachers/about/about.html|title=TRC About Us: Professor Garfield|accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His influences include [[Mort Walker]]'s ''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' and ''[[Hi and Lois]]'', [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]'', [[Milton Caniff]]'s ''[[Steve Canyon]]'' and [[Johnny Hart]]'s ''[[B.C. (comic strip)|B.C]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.calendars.com/2012/11/interview-with-jim-davis/ |date=November 9, 2012 |title=Interview with Jim Davis |publisher=calendars.com |accessdate=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
