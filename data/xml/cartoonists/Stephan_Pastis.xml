==Background==
Pastis was raised in [[San Marino, California]].&lt;ref name="Chron"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hartlaub |first=Peter |title=Cartoonist Stephan Pastis cast aside his career in law to put Pearls on the comics page |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-09-16/entertainment/17389937_1_stephan-pastis-charles-schulz-comic-strip-artists |date=September 16, 2005 |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started cartooning as a child; his mother brought him pens and paper to amuse him when he was "sick a lot" and had to stay in bed. He attended the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]], earning a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Political Science in 1989. The following year Pastis attended [[law school]] at [[UCLA School of Law|UCLA]], where he received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The State Bar of California |title=Stephan Thomas Pastis - #168717 |work=Attorney Search |url=http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/168717 |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stephan |last=Pastis |work=Pearls Before Swine |title=Comic for March 18, 2011 |url=http://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2011/03/18 |date=March 18, 2011 |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept drawing all during this time, coming up with the first ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comics)|Pearls Before Swine]]'' character, Rat, during what he said was a boring class in law school.&lt;ref name="jd"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=JDBliss |title=Interview: Stephan Pastis: Attorney Turned Cartoonist |url=http://www.jdblissblog.com/2006/11/stephan_pastis_.html |date=November 2006 |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;When I wrote for him [Rat] it seemed pretty honest. It was the first character where I could really say what's on my mind. When I put it on paper, it's my voice. So it works for me.&lt;ref name="rsmith91"&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Richard L. |title=Stephan Pastis: Animal Attitude |work=Crescent Blues |url=http://www.crescentblues.com/8_9issue/int_pastis.shtml |volume=9 |issue=1 |year=2006 |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 1993 to 2002, Pastis was an insurance defense litigation attorney in the San Francisco Bay area, but quickly became disenchanted with the legal profession. He did not like its adversarial nature, nor "the anxiety and tension it produced,"&lt;ref name="jd" /&gt; so in the mid-1990s he revisited his earlier ambition of becoming a [[Print syndication|syndicated]] cartoonist by submitting various concepts to syndication agencies.

==''Pearls Before Swine''==
{{main|Pearls Before Swine (comic strip)}}
The character of [[Rat (Pearls Before Swine)|Rat]] came from Pastis's earlier strip, ''Rat''. The character of [[Pig (Pearls Before Swine)|Pig]], who is Rat's opposite, had been featured in ''The Infirm'', which was about an attorney who numbered an evil pig farmer among his clients. Although Pastis had developed the characters, they were still just stick figures with jokes. One day in 1996, Pastis drove to an ice rink in Santa Rosa where [[Charles Schulz]], the creator of ''[[Peanuts (comic strip)|Peanuts]]'', had his coffee every day. The meeting did not begin auspiciously, since Pastis blurted out: "Hi, Sparky [Schulz's nickname], my name is Stephan Pastis and I'm a lawyer."  Schulz turned pale; he thought Pastis was there to serve him with a subpoena. However, he recovered, and Pastis remembers Schulz's graciousness: &lt;blockquote&gt;I was a total stranger to him, and he let me sit down at his table and we talked for an hour.  I took a picture with him. He looked at some of the strips that I had been doing and gave me some tips. Man, I was on cloud nine.&lt;ref name="Chron" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to ''Peanuts'', Pastis drew inspiration from ''[[Dilbert]]''. &lt;blockquote&gt;What worked for me personally was to study the writing of Dilbert. I just bought a bunch of Dilbert books and studied how to write a 3-panel strip.  Then I showed them to a group of people who were acquaintances (but not quite friends) in order to get their honest assessment of which ones were funny and which ones weren't. As to the ins and outs of getting syndicated, I bought a book called "Your Career in the Comics" by Lee Nordling.&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;{{cite web |first=Stephan |last=Pastis |work=The Official Pearls Before Swine Blog |title=About |url=http://stephanpastis.wordpress.com/about/ |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Pastis drew about 200 strips for the new comic and selected 40 of the best, but fearing more rejection, let them sit on the counter in his basement for the next two years. It was not until 1999, when he visited the grave of a college friend who had been a free spirit and had encouraged him to be the same, that he overcame his fear and submitted them to three different syndicates, including [[United Media|United Features]]. United took the unprecedented step of first running the strips on its comics.com Internet site to gauge reader response. When [[Scott Adams]], ''Dilbert'''s creator, whom Pastis had never met, endorsed the strip the response "went through the roof".&lt;ref name="rsmith91"/&gt;

Pastis also credits ''Get Fuzzy'' cartoonist [[Darby Conley]] with contributing to the development of the strip.  They met through their syndication attorney, and Conley taught him how to color the Sunday strips and add gray tones to the dailies.&lt;ref name="rsmith91"/&gt;

Eight months afterwards, Pastis gleefully quit his law practice.&lt;ref name="jd" /&gt; Pastis attributes his dissatisfaction with the law in being helpful insofar that "humor is a reaction to and defense against unhappiness",&lt;ref name="jd" /&gt; and that wanting to get out of his job provided him with the impetus to create better comic strips so that he could get selected for syndication.&lt;ref name="rsmith91"/&gt;

Fifteen years later, ''Pearls'' was still one of the fastest-growing comic strips, appearing in more than 650 newspapers worldwide.&lt;ref name="blog" /&gt;  Pastis generally works five to nine months ahead of deadline, a rarity in the world of newspaper comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stephan |last=Pastis |work=The Official Pearls Before Swine Blog |title=About |url=http://stephanpastis.wordpress.com/about/ |date=April 27, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastis lives in [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], California with his wife and two children, where he is on the board of the Charles Schulz Museum, helping with merchandising rights issues and answering questions about ''Peanuts''. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Schulz is to comic strips what Marlon Brando was to acting.  It was so revolutionary. Before ‘Peanuts,’ the writing was physical, over the top, but Sparky goes inside the soul.  His influence on me is enormous. I’ve taken his backgrounds, the front porch, the beach and the TV beanbag. Rat is Lucy, Goat is Linus and Pig is Charlie Brown. Sparky is a template, whether or not you know it, he’s the template.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreesen |first=Kathleen |title=A pig, a rat and a goat |work=[[Napa Valley Register]] |url=http://napavalleyregister.com/news/local/a-pig-a-rat-and-a-goat/article_e9f30798-0162-500b-bcb4-d4b2479d6d56.html |date=September 2, 2006 |accessdate=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June 2014, Pastis collaborated with [[Bill Watterson]], the creator of ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'', to do a week-long story line in which a second-grade girl named "Libby" wrote a few of Pastis's cartoon frames for him. After the strips were published, Pastis revealed that the artwork for three of the strips&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2014/06/04 |title=''Pearls Before Swine'' |date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2014/06/05 |title=''Pearls Before Swine'' |date=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2014/06/06 |title=''Pearls Before Swine'' |date=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was in fact drawn by Watterson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stephanpastis.wordpress.com/2014/06/07/ever-wished-that-calvin-and-hobbes-creator-bill-watterson-would-return-to-the-comics-page-well-he-just-did |author=Stephan Pastis |date=7 June 2014 |title=Ever Wished That Calvin and Hobbes Creator Bill Watterson Would Return to the Comics Page? Well, He Just Did.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last cartoon of the sequence, Libby explains to Pastis that she would not continue drawing comic strips, saying that "There's a magical world out there," a reference to the words spoken by Calvin in the final strip of ''Calvin and Hobbes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailydot.com/lol/bill-watterson-pearls-before-swine |title='Calvin and Hobbes' creator Bill Watterson's secret return to comics |publisher=''[[The Daily Dot]]'' |author=Cooper Fleishman |date=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treasuries==
Pastis's first treasury, ''Sgt. Piggy's Lonely Hearts Club Comic'', was published in 2004. In addition to the content of the previous books, ''BLTs Taste So Darn Good'' and ''This Little Piggy Stayed Home'', and Sunday strips in full color, Pastis included responses from readers and a section in which he explained why certain strips were not successful, and how he would have corrected the content. He continues to release the treasuries at the rate of about one every two years, with his ninth one, ''Pearls Hogs the Road'', released in 2017. Each book in the series is subtitled "A ''Pearls Before Swine'' Treasury".
