'''Ed Subitzky''', full name Edward Jack Subitzky (born March 19, 1943), is an American writer and artist, who is best known as a [[cartoonist]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farleftside.com/extras/subitzky.html/ "Saturday Night on Antarius! The planet with 12 different sexes)"] by Ed Subitzky for [[National Lampoon (magazine)]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[comics artist]], and [[humorist]]/humor writer. He has also worked as a [[television]] [[comedy]] writer and [[performer]], a writer and performer of [[radio]] [[comedy]], and a writer of radio [[drama]], as well as creating comedy and humor in various other [[published media|media]]. He is a member of the [[Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]], and the [[Writers Guild of America]]. He appears in the 2015 documentary film ''[[National Lampoon: Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead]]'', and was featured on one of the posters for the film.

In the early 1970s, Subitzky became a [[contributing editor]] at [[National Lampoon magazine|''National Lampoon'']] magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marksverylarge.com/booksetc/encyclopedia.html/''The National Lampoon Encyclopedia of Humor'', editor Michael O'Donoghue, 1973, table of contents, shown at "Mark's Very Large National Lampoon Site" downloaded Aug 9, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; where he worked with many well-regarded humor and comedy creators including [[Henry Beard]], [[Doug Kenney]], [[Michael O'Donoghue]], [[P. J. O'Rourke]], and [[Michael C. Gross|Michael Gross]]. Subitzky also worked with ''National Lampoon'' comedy performers [[John Belushi]] and [[Chevy Chase]], both in numerous episodes of the ''[[National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'', and on the comedy record album ''[[Official National Lampoon Stereo Test and Demonstration Record]]''.

Subitzky went on to various other kinds of humor and comedy work, including appearing on television multiple times with [[David Letterman]], and more work for radio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.review-mag.com/archive/650-659/658/brian.htm/See section, "Theater of the Air"] written 2009, downloaded Aug 9th 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written broadcast [[horror fiction|horror stories]].

During the 1990s, several comic strips of his appeared as "Op/Art" in the [[op-ed]] pages of the ''[[New York Times]]''.

Since 2003, Subitzky has contributed 17 pieces (including essays, stories, cartoons, and comic strips) on the subject of [[consciousness]] to a serious science [[academic journal|journal]], the ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imprint.co.uk/jcs_10_12.html]/Journal of Consciousness Studies December 2003, contents, listed under "Off the Page"]&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, Subitzky had a [[day job]] as an advertising [[copywriter]].

==Early life==
Subitzky was born in and grew up in [[Mount Vernon, New York]], just outside [[New York City]]. As a child, he read a wide variety of comic books and '' [[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine. He was greatly influenced by the work of [[Harvey Kurtzman]] and to a lesser extent that of [[Will Elder]], both of whom he met briefly in Mount Vernon when he was about 12 years old.

He was educated at what is now [[Binghamton University]], where he was a [[mathematics]] major who also took many [[philosophy]] courses.

A few years later, he moved into [[Manhattan]], and took cartooning classes at the [[School of Visual Arts]]. The classes were taught by [[R.O. Blechman|Bob Blechman]] and Charles Slackman.

==''National Lampoon'' magazine==
Subitzky ended up doing a great deal of work for ''National Lampoon'' magazine. His contributions primarily consisted of comic strips, cartoons, and humor writing.

His connection with ''National Lampoon'' magazine was first established in 1972, when contributing editor [[Michel Choquette]] visited the cartooning class which Subitzky attended.&lt;ref&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;47, Levin, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Choquette took a liking to Subitzky's work, and brought him over to the offices of ''National Lampoon''.

Subitzky subsequently became a long-term contributing editor; one or more of his [[comic strips]], [[cartoons]], and written [[Article (publishing)|articles]] appeared in almost every issue of the magazine. In September 1974, he guest-edited the "[[Old Age]]" issue of the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7409.html/Mark's Very Large National Lampoon Site, table of contents for National Lampoon Issue September 1974, Vol. 1. No. 54]&lt;/ref&gt;
His name remained on the [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]] of ''National Lampoon'' all through the 1970s, through the decline of the magazine in the 1980s, and almost up to the point of its eventual demise.

[[Shary Flenniken]], in the biography on her official website, describes Subitzky as "hysterically funny and unassuming".&lt;ref&gt;Fedge.net, Shary Flenniken, Biography, 2005-2009, [http://www.fedge.net/sharyflenniken/] accessed 2014-6-13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic strips===
Subitzky's roughly 100 comic strips for the ''National Lampoon'' included “Saturday Night on Antarius!”, “Two-way Comics!", "Eight Comics in One!”, and “Come Too Soon Comics!” Many of his comic strips ran to several pages, and featured numerous very small panels.

===Written humor===
His approximately 100 articles and written pieces for ''National Lampoon'' included “How I Spent My Summer” in the ''Self-Indulgence'' issue (December 1973, Vol. 1, No. 45)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7312.html Marksverylarge.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Stupidworld" in the ''Stupid'' issue (March 1974, Vol 1, No 48).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7403.html Marksverylarge.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fumetti===
Two of the many [[Photo strip|fumetti]], also known as photo funnies, that Subitzky wrote were "The Perfect Date" and "Every Red-Blooded American Boy's Dream: Three Pretty Girls Doing Just What You Want So You Can Masturbate!"

===''National Lampoon''  books===
In 1974, Subitzky wrote two sections of the infamous ''[[National Lampoon 1964 High School Yearbook Parody]]'': the first piece in the yearbook, which is the Principal's letter, and "In Memorium" {{sic}}, which is a parody of a student [[wiktionary:in memoriam|In Memoriam]] piece.

In the same year, Subitzky wrote numerous sections of the ''National Lampoon''  book,''[[The Job of Sex]]'', which was a parody of ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''.

His writing and cartooning were reprinted in many ''National Lampoon'' [[anthologies]].

==Other anthologies==
Pieces of his have been included in several other [[anthology|anthologies]], including the 1990 Harper/Collins  ''Big Book of New American Humor'', and more than one collection edited by the cartoonist [[Sam Gross]].

In 1972, a comic of Subitzky's, "Two-headed Sam in the Singles Bar!", was drawn especially for the comic book about the 1960s entitled ''[[The Someday Funnies]]'', which was put together by [[Michel Choquette]] during the 1970s, and which was finally published in 2011.

==Works for radio==

===''National Lampoon'' radio===
Subitzky was a writer for and an occasional performer on ''[[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'', which ran for a little over a year in 1973 to 1974. He conceptualized and wrote all, or nearly all, of the “Public Disservice Announcements” (which were parodies of [[public service announcements]]), as well as a number of other pieces. Some selections from the ''Radio Hour'' work appeared on the CD [[album]] ''[[Gold Turkey]]''.

He also conceived, wrote, and starred in a one-hour, two-episode [[radio play]] for ''The National Lampoon Radio Hour''. The play was a spoof of popular [[science-fiction]]/[[Horror fiction|horror]] dramas, and was entitled ''The Sluts from Space''. The two episodes aired on May 25 and June 2 of 1974. Subitzky [[voice acting|voiced]] the part of the science-[[nerd]] hero, Timmy Johnson, who by clever control of the supply of [[deodorant]]s, manages to save the world from [[alien invader]]s disguised as beautiful and seductive women. The ''Sluts from Space'' episodes of the show are listed in detail at: [http://www.marksverylarge.com/nlrh/nlrh740525_28.html] and [http://www.marksverylarge.com/nlrh/nlrh740602_29.html].

===Horror stories===
In 1980, Subitzky wrote numerous pieces for a nationally [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series of five-minute [[horror story|horror stories]], which were broadcast on radio. The series was entitled ''The Nightwatch''. Some of these stories were also made available on an album by Clack, Inc., called ''Ten Horror Stories: For Radio''.&lt;ref&gt;Amazon,com The Nightwatch - Ten Horror Stories for Radio [https://www.amazon.com/The-Nightwatch-Horror-Stories-Radio/dp/B005Y0RDWY] accessed 2014-6-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==''National Lampoon'' comedy albums==
Subitzky was the sole author of two ''National Lampoon'' comedy albums:

* ''[[Official National Lampoon Stereo Test and Demonstration Record]]'', 1974, was voiced by John Belushi and Chevy Chase, among others.
* ''[[The Official National Lampoon Car Stereo Test &amp; Demonstration Tape]]'', 1980, was on [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] for [[car stereo]].

==Television work with David Letterman==

===Comedy writing and performing===
Subitzky was a comedy writer on ''[[The David Letterman Show]]'' for its first season on the air in 1982, and he also appeared on the show many times, in variations of a [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] which is sometimes referred to as “the imposter".

In these sketches, Letterman starts by introducing Subitzky as someone else altogether. In the earliest of his ''Late Night'' appearances, the person supposedly featured was often a minor [[celebrity]], such as an author. After a few minutes of interviewing, Subitzky breaks down and admits to Letterman that he is not that person, and had only pretended to be that person so that he could be on television. He then runs out through the audience apologizing abjectly.

Subitzky reprised this role in 12 more appearances on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''. Although he wears a [[tuxedo]] as [[James Clavell]], a [[motorcycle jacket]] as [[Don Henley]], and a wig and women's clothing as "Elizabeth Callahan", usually no attempt is made to have him look more like the people he is pretending to be.

As ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer  David Browne explained:&lt;ref&gt;Website: RollingStone.com, Culture, News, "David Letterman Year One: A backstage and in-depth look at how a gap-toothed failed morning-show host and a ragtag band of misfits and rejects changed television forever", issue date
 September 29th, 2011 [https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/david-letterman-year-one-20110929] Accessed 2016-9-28&lt;/ref&gt;

"One night, Letterman introduced Don Henley – and out came Ed Subitzky, a balding, overweight staff writer who answered all of Letterman's questions as if he actually were the Eagles drummer. At the end of the segment, Subitzky broke down and confessed, "I'm not Don Henley – I'm just a sick man!" before running offstage. Then, a few weeks later, Letterman would repeat the gag all over again with another celebrity name."

==The ''New York Times'' Op-Ed page, and magazine work==
During the 1990s, Subitzky had seven cartoons published as "Op-Art" on the [[Editorial|Opinion-Editorial]] page of the ''[[New York Times]]'': February 22, 1997; June 27, 1997; September 27, 1997; November 22, 1997; February 16, 1998; August 15, 1998; and October 9, 1998.

His cartoons have also appeared in ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', and ''[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]]'', and some written pieces of his appeared in ''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]''.

==Science-related work==

Subitzky has created a number of science-related pieces. Starting in 1997, but primarily since 2012, he has had 12 letters, some humorous, and some serious, primarily about ideas in physics and cosmology, published in the international science magazine, ''[[New Scientist]]'', and he has also had a letter published in ''[[Science News]]''.

===''Journal of Irreproducible Results''===
In 1991, Subitzky co-wrote a science humor piece for the science humor magazine ''[[Journal of Irreproducible Results]]'' entitled, “A Call For More Scientific Truth in Product Warning Labels”, by Susan Hewitt and Edward Subitzky.[http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~geoffo/humour/truth/truth.html] This piece was subsequently quoted by both ''New Scientist'' and ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. Over 20 years after the piece was first published, it was still featured (both with and without its title, attribution, and introduction) on hundreds of [[websites]], including versions translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

==Philosophy-related work==

===''Journal of Consciousness Studies''===
[[File:Ed Subitzky 2012.JPG|thumb|left|Subitzky at his drawing table in 2012, working on a JCS comic strip]]
Subitzky has a life-long interest in both [[science]] and [[philosophy]], and he is especially fascinated by the very challenging [[Hard problem of consciousness|"hard problem" of consciousness]], i.e. why there is a subjective component to experience. Because of these interests, in 2003, Subitzky started contributing to the ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]'' (JCS),  an interdisciplinary, [[peer-reviewed]] academic journal that is dedicated entirely to the field of consciousness studies. JCS is published by Imprint Academic, of [[Exeter]], England.

Since 2003, Subitzky has had 9 drawn pieces and 10 written pieces published in the ''Journal of Consciousness Studies''. All the pieces make serious points, although some have a humorous perspective. The pieces include an essay, a visual essay, cartoons, comic strips, science-fiction short stories, a poem, and a fictional research paper. All of the pieces contain philosophical commentary on theories concerning the nature of consciousness.

==2011 [[Lynda Barry]] book ''Blabber, Blabber, Blabber''==
On page 13 of her 2011 book, ''Blabber, Blabber, Blabber: Volume 1 of Everything'', American cartoonist [[Lynda Barry]] lists Ed Subitzky as one of her early influences:

"By the time I graduated from high school I knew about bitter and sweet, but thanks to cartoonists like [[M.K. Brown]], [[Gahan Wilson]], and Ed Subitzky, I also knew about weird and rare and hilarious ways of changing one into the other.
