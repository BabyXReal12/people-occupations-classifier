'''Ted Key''' (born '''Theodore Keyser'''; August 25, 1912 &amp;ndash; May 3, 2008),&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/arts/design/06key.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;ref=obituaries&amp;adxnnlx=1210255335-eI4U3i0bNHL9FkaFQKLVvA Weber, Bruce. "Ted Key, 95, Creator of 'Hazel' Cartoon, Is Dead"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] [[cartoonist]] and writer.  He is best known as the creator of the cartoon panel ''[[Hazel (comic strip)|Hazel]]'', which was later the basis for a [[Hazel (TV series)|television series of the same name]], and also the creator of ''[[Mister Peabody|Peabody's Improbable History]]''. 

==College to cartoons==
Born in [[Fresno, California]], Key was the son of [[Latvia]]n immigrant Simon Keyser, who had changed his name from Katseff to Keyser, and then to "Key" during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Though his family thereafter went by Key, Theodore Keyser did not legally adopt the name until the 1950s.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; Attending the [[University of California, Berkeley]], Key became the art editor of the student newspaper, ''[[The Daily Californian]]'', and was associate editor of the campus humor magazine, the ''[[California Pelican (magazine)|California Pelican]]''&lt;ref name=king&gt;

Key also worked as associate editor of ''Judge'' in 1937.

==''Hazel''==
[[image:Hazelbook46.jpg|thumb]]
Key's most famous creation, the single-panel ''Hazel'', about a wry and bossy household maid, came to Key in 1943 in a dream that he drew the next morning and sent to ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', where it was accepted and began running regularly.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; He soon afterward gave the character a name and employment at the Baxter household. In 2008, the cartoonist's son, Peter Key, said, "He picked the name Hazel out of the air, but there was an editor at ''The Post'' who had a sister named Hazel. She thought her brother came up with the name, and she didnâ€™t speak to him for two years."&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

The cartoon ran until the weekly magazine ceased publication in 1969. ''Hazel'' was then picked up for newspaper syndication by [[King Features Syndicate]].&lt;ref name=toonopedia-hazel&gt;[http://toonopedia.com/hazel.htm Hazel] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/66tVx9fSn?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/hazel.htm Archived] from the original on April 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; With the increased output of six cartoons a week, Key hired veteran gag cartoonist [[Stan Fine]] to lend a hand.

Key later adapted his comic panel into the television show ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]'', starring [[Shirley Booth]] as the titular maid.  It ran from 1961 to 1964 on [[NBC]]; for its final 1965 season, the show switched to [[CBS]].  Key continued to draw the strip until his retirement in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Evanier| first =Mark| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Ted Key, R.I.P.| work =| publisher =P.O.V.

Key's other work in the comics field includes ''Diz and Liz'', a two-page feature that ran in ''[[Jack and Jill (magazine)|Jack and Jill]]'' magazine from 1961 to 1972, as well as creating the segment ''[[Mister Peabody|Peabody's Improbable History]]'' for producer [[Jay Ward]]'s [[animated television series]] ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Films and books==
He was the screenwriter for three [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] films (''[[The Cat from Outer Space]]'', ''[[Million Dollar Duck]]'' and ''[[Gus (1976 film)|Gus]]''), and he created several classic children's books, including ''Phyllis'' and ''The Biggest Dog in the World'' (later adapted into the film ''[[Digby, the Biggest Dog in the World]]'').&lt;ref name=pbj&gt;{{Cite news
