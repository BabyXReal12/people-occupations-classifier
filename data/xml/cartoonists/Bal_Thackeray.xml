'''Bal Keshav Thackeray''' ({{IPA-mr|ʈʰaːkəɾeː}}; 23 January 1926&amp;nbsp;– 17 November 2012) was an Indian politician who founded the [[Shiv Sena]], a [[Hindu]] right-wing [[Marathi people|Marathi]] [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] party active mainly in the western state of [[Maharashtra]].

Thackeray began his professional career as a [[cartoonist]] with the English language daily ''[[The Free Press Journal]]'' in [[Mumbai]], but left it in 1960 to form his own political weekly ''[[Marmik (periodical)|Marmik]]''. His political philosophy was largely shaped by his father [[Keshav Sitaram Thackeray]], a leading figure in the [[Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti|Samyukta Maharashtra]] (United Maharashtra) movement, which advocated the creation of a separate linguistic state. Through ''Marmik'', he campaigned against the growing influence of non-Marathis in Mumbai. In 1966, Thackeray formed the Shiv Sena party to advocate for the interests of [[Maharashtrians]] in Mumbai's political and professional landscape. Holding views attacking Muslims and once praising Adolf Hitler, he was known for his writings and was seen as a good orator.&lt;ref name="Time world" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaminsky" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

He had a large political influence in the state, especially in [[Mumbai]]; his party frequently used violent means against its detractors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thackeray and Chief Minister [[Manohar Joshi]] were blamed for inciting the shivsainiks to commit violence against Muslims during the 1992–1993 [[Bombay riots]] in the Srikrishna Commission Report, an inquiry by the government.&lt;ref name="narula99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fln" /&gt;

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Thackeray built the party by forming temporary alliances with nearly all of state's political parties.&lt;ref name="Kaminsky"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaminsky|first1=Arnold P.|last2=Long|first2=Roger D.|title=India Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37462-3|pages=693–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VVxlfDHGTFYC&amp;pg=PA694&amp;dq=|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thackeray was also the founder of the Marathi-language newspaper ''[[Saamana]]''.&lt;ref name="wan-ifra"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wan-press.org/3may/2000/profiles/IndiaGoenka.html|title = India|publisher = WAN-IFRA|date = |accessdate = 30 September 2012|dead-url = yes|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150410095734/http://www.wan-press.org/3may/2000/profiles/IndiaGoenka.html|archive-date = 2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the riots of 1992-93, he and his party took a [[Hindutva]] stance. In 1999, Thackeray was banned from voting and contesting in any election for six years on the recommendations of the Election Commission for indulging in seeking votes in the name of religion. Besides getting arrested multiple times and briefly going to prison, Thackeray never faced any major legal repercussions for his actions.&lt;ref name="Time world" /&gt; Upon his death, he was accorded a [[state funeral]] with a large number of mourners present. Thackeray did not hold any official position and never was formally elected as the leader of his party.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Early life ==

Thackeray was born in [[Pune]] on 23 January 1926 to Ramabai and [[Keshav Sitaram Thackeray]] (also known as 'Prabodhankar').&lt;ref name="Kaminsky" /&gt; He was the eldest of nine siblings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Milestones in the life of Sena chief Bal Thackeray|url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai/milestones-in-the-life-of-sena-chief-bal-thackeray/article1-960556.aspx|website = hindustantimes|publisher = HT Media Limited.|accessdate = 2 November 2014|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121120120712/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Milestones-in-the-life-of-Sena-chief-Bal-Thackeray/Article1-960556.aspx|archivedate = 20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and belonged to the Marathi [[Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu]] or CKP community.&lt;ref name="South Asia Bulletin"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East | journal  = South Asia Bulletin | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-AUAQAAIAAJ | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | page = 116 | accessdate=15 November 2012 | year=1996 | publisher=University of California, Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keshav was a progressive social activist and writer who was involved in the [[Samyukta Maharashtra Movement]] of the 1950s that argued for the creation of a unified state called Maharashtra for [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking areas with [[Mumbai]] as its capital. Keshav's political philosophy inspired Thackeray.&lt;ref name="Time world"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Firebrand Who Renamed Bombay: Bal Thackeray (1926–2012) |url=http://world.time.com/2012/11/17/the-firebrand-who-renamed-bombay-bal-thackeray-1926-2012/|publisher=Nov. 17, 2012 Time World|accessdate=14 June 2013|date=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Thackeray began his career as a cartoonist in the ''[[Free Press Journal]]'' in Mumbai. His cartoons were also published in the Sunday edition of ''[[The Times of India]]''. In 1960, he launched the cartoon weekly ''[[Marmik]]'' with his brother Srikant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He used it to campaign against the growing numbers and influence of non-Marathi people in Mumbai, targeting south Indians. After Thackeray's differences with the ''Free Press Journal'', he and four or five people, including politician [[George Fernandes]], left the paper and started their own daily ''News Day''. The paper survived for one or two months.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Pinto, Naresh Fernandes. Bombay, Meri Jaan: Writings on Mumbai, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
{{Further|Shiv Sena}}

==== 1966–1998 ====
The success of ''Marmik'' prompted him to form the [[Shiv Sena]] on 19 June 1966. The name "Shiv Sena" ([[Shivaji]]'s Army) was after the 17th century [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] king. Initially, Thackeray said it was not a political party but an army of Shivaji, inclined to fight for the Marathi ''manoos'' (person).&lt;ref name="Prakash2010"&gt;{{cite book|author = Gyan Prakash|title = Mumbai Fables|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TeRWxaJLoDUC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate = 4 December 2012|date = 21 September 2010|publisher = Princeton University Press|isbn = 978-0-691-15317-9|page = |pages = 228–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It demanded that native speakers of the state's local language [[Marathi language|Marathi]] (the "sons of the soil" movement) be given preferential treatment in private and public sector jobs. The early objective of the Shiv Sena was to ensure their job security competing against [[South Indian]]s and [[Gujaratis]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In its 1966 party manifesto, Thackeray primarily blamed south Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why no one dared to mess with Shiv Sena? : Special Report - India Today|url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bal-thackeray-death-shiv-sena-harvester-of-fear/1/234428.html|website = indiatoday.intoday.in|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Marmik'', Thackeray published a list of corporate officials from a local directory, many being south Indians, citing it as proof that Maharashtrians were being discriminated against.&lt;ref name="Prakash2010" /&gt;

His party grew in the next ten years. Senior leaders such as [[Babasaheb Purandare]], chief attorney for Trade Union of Maharashtra Madhav Mehere joined the party and chartered architect Madhav Gajanan Deshpande backed various aspects of the party operations. In 1969, Thackeray and [[Manohar Joshi]] were jailed after participating in a protest demanding the merger of [[Karwar]], [[Belgaum border dispute|Belgaum]] and [[Nipani]] regions in Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Obituary: Bal Thackeray-the tiger who ruled Mumbai : Bal Thackeray, News - India Today|url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bal-keshav-thackeray-obituary/1/229596.html|website = indiatoday.intoday.in|access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, it did not succeed in the local elections and it was active mainly in Bombay, compared to the rest of the state. The party set up local branch offices and settled disputes, complaints against the government.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It later started violent tactics with attacks against rival parties, migrants and the media; the party agitated by destroying public and private property.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = Bal Thackeray's political career - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-20180376|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-01-29|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Thackeray Controlled Mumbai for Four Decades|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324556304578124701259492508|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2016-02-08|issn = 0099-9660|first = Megha|last = Bahree}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thackeray publicly supported [[Indira Gandhi]] during the [[The Emergency (India)|1975 Emergency]] to avoid getting arrested; Thackeray supported the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] numerous times.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Dr.Hemchandra Gupte, [[Mayor of Mumbai|Mayor of Bombay]] and the former family physician and confidante of Thackeray, left Shivsena in 1976 citing importance given to money, violence committed by the Shiv Sena members and Thackeray's support for Mrs.Gandhi and the 1975 emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Wages of Violence : Naming and identity in postcolonial Bombay|author= Thomas Blom Hansen|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2001|page=238|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-y3iNt0djbQC&amp;pg=PA238|quote=18: According to Hemchandra Gupte, a former confidante of Thackeray, his major reason for leaving the party for his growing disgust with the prominence of money and the "goonda'ization" of the party(interview , 5th october 1992). 21.Interview, 3 october 1992, with Hemchandra Gupte, physician, formerly Bal Thackeray's family doctor, and Shiv Sena's mayor of Bombay from 1971 to 1972.

Politically, the Shiv Sena was [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], and wrested control of trade unions in Mumbai from the [[Communist Party of India|Communist Party of India (CPI)]]. Local unemployed youth from the declining textile industry joined the party&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and it further expanded because of Marathi migrants from the [[Konkan|Konkan region]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Leader who brought ethnic politics to Mumbai melting pot|url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bal-thackeray-leader-who-brought-ethnic-politics-to-mumbai-melting-pot/article4105715.ece|newspaper = The Hindu|date = 2012-11-17|access-date = 2016-01-30|issn = 0971-751X|language = en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, it became a threat to the ruling Congress party which initially encouraged it because of it rivalling the CPI. In 1989, the Sena's newspaper ''[[Saamna]]'' was launched by Thackeray.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-11-19/pune/35204806_1_bal-thackeray-saamna-sena-leader How Sena got the title 'Saamna' for mouthpiece], timesofindia.com, 19 November 2012.

Following the [[Bombay riots|1992 Bombay riots]], Thackeray took stances viewed as anti-Muslim and based on [[Hindutva]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The SS later allied itself with the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP). The BJP-Shiv Sena alliance won the 1995 [[Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha|Maharashtra State Assembly]] elections and were in power from 1995 to 1999. Thackeray declared himself to be the "remote control" chief minister.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Godbole1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Madhav Godbole|title=Unfinished Innings: Recollections and Reflections of a Civil Servant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ItQF4g08KbwC&amp;pg=PA414|accessdate=4 December 2012|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-0883-5|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thackeray and the Chief Minister [[Manohar Joshi]] were explicitly named for inciting the Shivsainiks for violence against Muslims during the 1992–1993 riots in an inquiry ordered by the [[government of India]], the Srikrishna Commission Report. However, [[Manohar Joshi]], then a part of the BJP-Sena government called the report "anti-Hindu, pro-Muslim and biased" and refused to adopt the commission's recommendations.&lt;ref name="fln"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1517/15170200.htm|title = The Shiv Sena indicted|publisher = Frontlineonnet.com|date = |accessdate = 2013-06-14|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130328163323/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1517/15170200.htm|archivedate = 28 March 2013|quote=The Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party Government in Maharashtra has rejected the core of the report, which was presented before the two Houses of the legislature on August 6 along with a memorandum of action to be taken thereon.

He had influence in the film industry. His party workers agitated against films he found controversial and would disrupt film screenings, causing losses. [[Bombay (film)|''Bombay'']], a 1995 film on the riots was opposed by them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== 1999–2012 ====
On 28 July 1999 Thackeray was banned from voting and contesting in any election for six years from 11 December 1999 till 10 December 2005 on the recommendations of the Election Commission for indulging in corrupt practice by seeking votes in the name of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/NM1/Thackeray-votes-after-expiry-of-ban/Article1-16731.aspx|title = Thackeray votes after expiry of ban|publisher = Hindustan Times|date = 2004-04-26|accessdate = 2013-06-14|dead-url = yes|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140111201658/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news-feed/archives/thackeray-votes-after-expiry-of-ban/article1-16731.aspx|archive-date = 2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banned from voting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/revents/01/19990199.htm#jul |title=Banned from voting |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=28 July 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030425223423/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/revents/01/19990199.htm |archivedate=25 April 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he was arrested for his role in the riots but was released because the [[statute of limitations]] expired.&lt;ref name="Time world" /&gt; In 2002, Thackeray issued a call to form Hindu [[suicide bomber]] squads to take on the menace of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Thackeray for Hindu suicide squads"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-10-15/india/27292201_1_suicide-squads-annual-dussehra-rally-state-and-central-govenments|title=Thackeray for Hindu suicide squads|accessdate=2013-06-27|publisher=[[Times of India]]|date=15 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Maharashtra government registered a case against him for inciting enmity between different groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=15895|title=Case filed against Thackeray for urging anti-terror suicide-squads|accessdate=25 August 2007|publisher=ExpressIndia.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181915/http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=15895| archivedate= 30 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least two organisations founded and managed by retired Indian Army officers, Lt Col Jayant Rao Chitale and Lt Gen.

In 2006, Thackeray's nephew [[Raj Thackeray]] broke away from Shiv Sena to form the [[Maharashtra Navnirman Sena]] (MNS) during Thackeray's retirement and appointment of his son, [[Uddhav Thackeray|Uddhav]] rather than Raj as the leader of Shiv Sena.

=== Political views ===
Thackeray was criticised for his praise&lt;ref&gt;P. 90 India and the International System By Gupta, Mannaraswamighala Sreeranga Rajan, Shivaji Ganguly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. 201 Jawaharlal Nehru on Communalism By Nand Lal Gupta&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Adolf Hitler]] which he later neither admitted nor denied.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was quoted by ''[[Asiaweek]]'' as saying: "I am a great admirer of Hitler, and I am not ashamed to say so! I do not say that I agree with all the methods he employed, but he was a wonderful organiser and orator, and I feel that he and I have several things in common...What India really needs is a [[dictator]] who will rule benevolently, but with an iron hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/95/0922/nat5.html |title=TIME Magazine&amp;nbsp;— Asia Edition&amp;nbsp;— November 19, 2012 No. 21 |publisher=Asiaweek.com |date= |accessdate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1993 interview, Thackeray stated, "There is nothing wrong" if "[[Muslim]]s are treated as [[Jew]]s were in [[Nazi Germany]]." In another 1992 interview, Thackeray stated, "If you take ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and if you remove the word 'Jew' and put in the word 'Muslim', that is what I believe in".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=D’Souza|first=Dilip|title=Hitler's Strange Afterlife in India|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/hitlers-strange-afterlife-in-india|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Indian Express]]'' published an interview on 29 January 2007: "Hitler did very cruel and ugly things.

He told ''[[India Today]]'' "[Muslims] are spreading like a cancer and should be operated on like a cancer. The...country should be saved from the Muslims and the police should support them [Hindu Maha Sangh] in their struggle just like the police in Punjab were sympathetic to the Khalistanis."&lt;ref&gt;Bal Thackeray in ''[[India Today]]'', Shiv Sena leader of Bombay, June 15, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview in 1998, he said that his stance had changed on many issues that the Shiv Sena had with Muslims, particularly regarding the Babri Mosque or [[Ram Janmabhoomi]] issue:&lt;ref name="1998 interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/jan/21nandy.htm |title=The Rediff Interview/ Bal Thackeray |publisher=Rediff.com |date=21 January 1998 |accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We must look after the Muslims and treat them as part of us."&lt;ref name="1998 interview" /&gt; He also expressed admiration for Muslims in Mumbai in the wake of the [[11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings]] perpetrated by [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalists]]. In response to threats made by [[Abu Azmi]], a leader of the [[Samajwadi Party]], that accusations of terrorism directed at Indian Muslims would bring about communal strife, Thackeray said that the unity of Mumbaikars (residents of Mumbai) in the wake of the attacks was "a slap to fanatics of Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi" and that Thackeray "salute[s] those Muslims who participated in the two minutes' silence on July 18 to mourn the blast victims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-07-20/india/27814176_1_blast-victims-serial-blasts-sena-chief-bal-thackeray | work=The Times Of India | title=Mumbai's unity a slap to fanatics: Thackeray | date=20 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again in 2008 he wrote: "Islamic terrorism is growing and Hindu terrorism is the only way to counter it. We need suicide bomb squads to protect India and Hindus."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/politicians-indulge-in-hate-speech-with-impunity/89623-37-64.html Leaders deliver hate speech with impunity].

In 2008, following agitation against [[Biharis]] and other north Indians travelling to Maharashtra to take civil service examinations for the [[Indian Railways]] due to an overlimit of the quota in their home provinces, Thackeray also said of Bihari MPs that they were "spitting in the same plate from which they ate" when they criticised Mumbaikars and Maharashtrians. He wrote: "They are trying to add fuel to the fire that has been extinguished, by saying that Mumbaikars have rotten brains." He also criticised [[Chhath Puja]], a holiday celebrated by Biharis and those from eastern Uttar Pradesh, which occurs on six days of the Hindu month of Kartik. He said that it was not a real holiday.&lt;ref name="IE_rattled" /&gt; This was reportedly a response to MPs from Bihar who had disrupted the proceedings of the [[Lok Sabha]] in protest to the attacks on North Indians.&lt;ref name="IE_rattled"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/story/281062.html|title= Rattled by Raj, Thackeray abuses Biharis news|publisher=''[[The Indian Express]]''|accessdate=2 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bihar Chief Minister [[Nitish Kumar]], upset with the remarks, called on the prime minister and the central government to intervene in the matter. A ''Saamna'' editorial prompted at least 16 MPs from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, belonging to the [[Rashtriya Janata Dal]], [[Janata Dal (United)]], Samajwadi Party and the [[Indian National Congress]], to give notice for [[breach of privilege]] proceedings against Thackeray.&lt;ref name="IE_rattled" /&gt; After the matter was raised in the Lok Sabha, [[Speaker of Lok Sabha|Speaker]] [[Somnath Chatterjee]] said: "If anybody has made any comment on our members' functioning in the conduct of business in the House, not only do we treat that with the contempt that it deserves, but also any action that may be necessary will be taken according to procedure and well established norms. Nobody will be spared.'"&lt;ref name="IE_rattled" /&gt;

In 2009, he criticised Marathi cricketer [[Sachin Tendulkar]] for saying he was an Indian before he was a Maharashtrian.&lt;ref name="Time world" /&gt;

=== Support for Kashmiri Pandits ===
In 1990, an Islamic militant organization, through the columns of an Urdu daily, warned [[Kashmiri Pandits]] to leave the valley within 36 hours. Bal Thackeray got seats reserved in engineering colleges for the children of these [[Kashmiri Pandits]] in Maharashtra. He was one of the first persons to help them after which Punjab also followed suit. At a meeting with them he supported the idea that the [[Kashmiri Pandits]] could be armed for their self-defence against the violent Jihadis.

In response to these reports, the party later sent a cheque of Rs. 500,000 to the Corporation.&lt;ref name="Zee news" /&gt;

''[[The Hindu]],'' in an editorial, said regarding the shutdown that "Thackeray’s legion of followers raised him to the status of a demigod who could force an entire State to shut down with the mere threat of violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = A troubling legacy|url = http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-troubling-legacy/article4108876.ece|newspaper = The Hindu|date = 2012-11-19|access-date = 2016-02-07|issn = 0971-751X|language = en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death, police arrested a 21-year-old woman who posted a Facebook comment against him, as well as her friend who "liked" the comment.

== Legacy ==
Thackeray was called 'Balasaheb' and ''Hindu Hruday Samrat'' ("Emperor of Hindu Hearts") by his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Nationalism and Governance|author=John McGuire, Ian Copland|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|quote=described as the 'Supremo' of the Shiv Sena, goes by the nickname 'Hindu Hriday Samrat' or 'Emperor of the Hindu Heart'}}&lt;/ref&gt; His yearly address at [[Shivaji Park]] was popular among his followers. In 2012, he instead gave a video-taped speech and urged his followers "to give the same love and affection to his son and political heir Uddhav as they had given him".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thackeray was known to convert popular sentiment into votes, getting into controversies and making no apologies for it though his son has tried to tone down the party's stance after his death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was known for his inflammatory writings,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; was seen as a good orator who used cruel humour to engage his audience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He had a large political influence throughout the state, especially in Mumbai.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His party never had any formal internal elections nor was he ever formally elected as its chief at any point.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Gyan Prakash]] said, "Of course, the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement had mobilized Marathi speakers as a political entity, but it was Thackeray who successfully deployed it as an anti-immigrant, populist force."&lt;ref name="Prakash2010" /&gt;

A memorial for him was proposed at Shivaji Park but legal issues and opposition from local residents continue to delay it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Thackeray is satirised in [[Salman Rushdie]]'s 1995 novel ''[[The Moor's Last Sigh]]'' as 'Raman Fielding'. The book was banned by the Maharashtra state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burns|first=John F.|title=New Delhi Journal; Another Rushdie Novel, Another Bitter Epilogue|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/02/world/new-delhi-journal-another-rushdie-novel-another-bitter-epilogue.html|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 December 1995|authorlink=John F.

Thackeray previewed director [[Ram Gopal Verma|Ram Gopal Verma's]] film ''[[Sarkar (film)|Sarkar]]'', which is loosely based on him, released in 2005.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The 2011 documentary ''[[Jai Bhim Comrade]]'' depicted a speech by Thackeray at a public rally, in which he articulated "genocidal sentiments" about Muslims, stating that they were the "species to be exterminated." The documentary followed this by showing several [[Dalit]] leaders criticizing Thackeray for his beliefs.&lt;ref name="Matzner 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matzner|first1=Deborah|title=''Jai Bhim Comrade'' and the Politics of Sound in Urban Indian Visual Culture|journal=Visual Anthropology Review|date=Fall 2014|volume=30|issue=4|pages=127–138|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
