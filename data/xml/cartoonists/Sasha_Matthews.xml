==Activism==

===''Everyday Superheroes'' Fundraiser for ACLU===


From early 2017 through early 2018 Matthews worked on a fundraiser for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. Her idea was to represent everyday people doing what they do in everyday life, but in the iconic form of a superhero. She called this project ''Everyday Superheroes.'' In the end she completed 95 commissioned drawings and collected $11,635.83, which she presented to ACLU President [[Susan Herman]] at the ACLU headquarters in downtown Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.westsiderag.com/2017/11/19/local-13-year-old-gives-aclu-11635-83-earned-from-her-everyday-superhero-drawings|title=Local 13-Year-Old Gives ACLU $11,635.83, Earned from Her 'Everyday Superhero' Drawings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the way Matthews' ''Everyday Superheroes'' earned recognition from United States Senator [[Kamala Harris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/841095968498036737|title=Kamala Harris on Twitter|work=twitter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was written about by [[Amy Poehler]]'s [[Amy_Poehler%27s_Smart_Girls|Smart Girls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amysmartgirls.com/meet-sasha-matthews-teen-artist-who-has-raised-almost-10-000-for-the-aclu-a21444d3f4f|title=Meet Sasha Matthews, Teen Artist Who Has Raised Almost $10,000 for the ACLU}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HuffPost|Huffington Post]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/girl-raises-more-than-2000-for-the-aclu-with-everyday-superheroes-art_us_58c086b5e4b0d1078ca3c036|title=Girl Raises More Than $2,000 For The ACLU With 'Everyday Superheroes' Art|first=Taylor|last=Pittman|date=9 March 2017|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ashton Kutcher]]'s [[A_Plus_(aplus.com)|A Plus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aplus.com/a/sasha-matthews-everyday-superheroes-drawings-aclu|title=This 12-Year-Old Girl's Comic Series Shows That Everyone Is A Superhero No Matter What|date=20 March 2017|work=aplus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNAinfo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170308/upper-west-side/donation-commission-illustrations-superheroes-aclu-sasha-harmon-matthews|title=12-Year-Old Cartoonist's 'Everyday Superheroes' Help Raise Money for ACLU|work=dnainfo.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322044022/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170308/upper-west-side/donation-commission-illustrations-superheroes-aclu-sasha-harmon-matthews|archivedate=2017-03-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and West Side Rag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westsiderag.com/2017/02/27/12-year-old-local-artist-creates-everyday-superheroes-to-raise-money-for-the-aclu|title=12-Year-Old Local Artist Creates 'Everyday Superheroes’ to Raise Money for the ACLU|work=westsiderag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.westsiderag.com/2017/11/19/local-13-year-old-gives-aclu-11635-83-earned-from-her-everyday-superhero-drawings|title=Local 13-Year-Old Gives ACLU $11,635.83, Earned from Her ‘Everyday Superhero’ Drawings|work=westsiderag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACLU President [[Susan Herman]] went on to commission an ''Everyday Superhero'' portrait of herself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rumblecomics.com/everyday-superheroes/susan-herman|title=Susan Herman Everyday Superhero by Rumble Comics|work=rumblecomics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another of ACLU Executive Director [[Anthony Romero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rumblecomics.com/everyday-superheroes/anthony-romero|title=Anthony Romero Everyday Superhero by Rumble Comics|work=rumblecomics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards===

The [[Scholastic_Corporation|Scholastic]] [[Alliance_for_Young_Artists_%26_Writers|Art &amp; Writing Awards]] recognize creative achievements of teenagers in grades 7-12. In 2018, nearly 350,000 works were submitted for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.artandwriting.org/what-we-do/the-awards/|title=The Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthews had intended to submit her ''Everyday Superheroes'' project under the Civic Expression category, for work that "expresses a vision of the society they are working to build, one that exemplifies democratic values and that allows all voices and viewpoints to be heard and respected."

Before she submitted her work, Matthews read the Terms &amp; Conditions and discovered that the Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards were claiming ownership of kids' copyrights. She highlighted the questionable text and tweeted a question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RumbleComics/status/940691277166927872|title=Rumble Comics on Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; She didn't receive a sensible response, so she wrote a cartoon about the situation and tweeted it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RumbleComics/status/944192049833791489|title=Rumble Comics on Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still no response, so next Matthews wrote up the experience for an 8th grade homework assignment. This report was then published by web site [[Boing_Boing|Boing Boing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2018/02/08/terms-and-conditions-apply.html|title=How a kid cartoonist avoided Scholastic's digital sharecropping trap}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards announced their intention to revise their Terms before the upcoming 2019 contest. This outcome was written about by [[Hyperallergic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/433005/kid-cartoonist-pushes-scholastic-art-contest-reconsider-copyright-policy/|title=Kid Cartoonist Pushes Scholastic Art Contest to Reconsider Its Copyright Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish national newspaper [[Politiken]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RumbleComics/status/981551991166992384|title=Rumble Comics on Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AM_New_York|AM New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amny.com/news/scholastic-awards-sasha-matthews-1.17127599|title=Manhattan teen cartoonist prompts review of Scholastic awards’ copyright rules}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Boing Boing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2018/03/12/after-copyright-wrangle-schol.html|title=After copyright wrangle, Scholastic promises better deal for competition entrants}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Editorial Cartooning===

Matthews responded to the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]] with a series of editorial cartoons, which were then written about by web site [[Hyperallergic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/432442/sasha-matthews-cartoonist-parkland-shooting/|title=How a 13-Year-Old Cartoonist Responded to the Parkland School Shooting}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously Matthews had responded to the [[Unite the Right rally]] in Charlottesville, which was written about by web site The Mary Sue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/charlottesville-cartoon-by-rumble-comics/|title=Our Favorite 12-Year-Old Cartoonist Had the Perfect Response to Trump and Charlottesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvel Comics &amp; Internet Trolls===

Matthews took a stand when a group of conservative [[Internet_troll|Internet trolls]] began attacking a group of women working at [[Marvel Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/news/female-marvel-comics-editor-harassed-online-milkshake-selfie/|title=Female Marvel Comics editor harassed online for milkshake selfie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative pundit [[Michelle_Malkin|Michelle Malkin]] wound up publicly siding with Matthews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/michellemalkin/status/892874887211212800|title=Michelle Malkin on Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the whole incident was covered by web site The Mary Sue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/the-case-of-the-12-year-old-brilliant-cartoonist/|title=A 12-Year-Old Cartoonist Got Trolled For Her Social Justice Views (So Let’s Help Her Out)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
