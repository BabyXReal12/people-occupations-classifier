== Early life and education ==
MacFarlane was born and raised in [[Kent, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; His parents, Ronald Milton MacFarlane (born 1946) and Ann Perry (née Sager; 1947–2010), were born in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="annperry" /&gt; His sister is voice actress [[Rachael MacFarlane|Rachael Ann MacFarlane]] (born 1976). He has roots in [[New England]] going back to the 1600s, and is a descendant of ''[[Mayflower]]'' passenger [[William Brewster (Mayflower passenger)|William Brewster]].&lt;ref name=wrgsou /&gt; MacFarlane's parents met in 1970, when they both lived and worked in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and married later that year.&lt;ref name="annperry" /&gt; The couple moved to Kent in 1972, where Ann began working in the Admissions Office at [[South Kent School]]. She later worked in the College Guidance and Admissions Offices at the [[Kent School]], a selective [[college preparatory school]], where Ronald was a teacher.&lt;ref name="annperry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="teacher"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=ST&amp;s_site=dfw&amp;p_multi=ST&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF920E64F34493&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=One-man campaign out for 'Family Guy' |work= Fort Worth Star-Telegram |agency=Associated Press |date=July 2, 1999 |accessdate=February 13, 2008 |quote=Seth MacFarlane has been out of prep school for eight years, but the headmaster is still on his case. The top administrator of the Kent School is leading a one-man campaign to get advertisers to drop The Family Guy, an animated TV comedy created by MacFarlane, a 1991 Kent alumnus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his childhood, MacFarlane developed an interest in illustration and began drawing cartoon characters [[Fred Flintstone]] and [[Woody Woodpecker]], as early as two years old.&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Levin|title='Dad' joins 'Guy' for yuks|date=February 2, 2005|publisher=Gannett Co. Inc.|url =https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-02-02-macfarlane_x.htm|work =USA Today|accessdate = December 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of five, MacFarlane knew that he would want to pursue a career in animation, and began by creating [[flip book]]s, after his parents found a book on the subject for him.&lt;ref name="studio1"&gt;{{cite video |people=MacFarlane, Seth |date=2009 |title=Inside the Actors Studio |medium=Television production |publisher=Bravo |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |quote= I was two years old when I started drawing... I knew by five that I wanted to get into animation, and there was just no... there was no information at the time. And I think my parents found one book on animation, that they scrounged up for me, and they got it from a library, you know, two towns over.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, aged nine, MacFarlane began publishing a weekly comic strip titled "Walter Crouton" for ''The Kent Good Times Dispatch'', the local newspaper in Kent, Connecticut, which paid him five dollars per week.&lt;ref name="E" /&gt;&lt;ref name="studio2"&gt;{{cite video |people=MacFarlane, Seth |date=2009 |title=Inside the Actors Studio |medium=Television production |publisher=Bravo |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |quote= Walter Crouton was a comic strip that I did for our local paper, and I started when I was about nine years old, and, I would do it every week for, you know, five bucks a pop.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one anecdote from the time, MacFarlane said in an October 2011 interview that as a child he was always "weirdly fascinated by the [[Mass (liturgy)|Communion]] ceremony". He created a strip with a character kneeling at the altar taking Communion and asking "Can I have fries with that?" The paper printed it and he got an "angry letter" from the local priest; it led to "sort of a little mini-controversy" in the town.&lt;ref name=MusicToo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/10/17/140946967/seth-macfarlane-tvs-family-guy-makes-music-too |title=Seth MacFarlane: TV's 'Family Guy' Makes Music, Too |date=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacFarlane received his high school diploma in 1991 from the Kent School.&lt;ref name="annperry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="teacher" /&gt; While there, he continued experimenting with animation, and his parents gave him an [[8 mm film|8 mm camera]].&lt;ref name="studio3"&gt;{{cite video |people=MacFarlane, Seth |date=2009 |title=Inside the Actors Studio |medium=Television production |publisher=Bravo |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |quote= I didn't really take a hard crack at {{interp|animation}} until I was in high school. My parents got me an 8&amp;nbsp;mm movie camera.}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane went on to study film, video and animation at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (RISD), where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.&lt;ref name="E" /&gt; As a student, he had originally intended to work for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], but changed his mind upon graduating.&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tv.yahoo.com/seth-macfarlane/contributor/663655/bio;_ylt=Aon954w635FJbS9IA6nuh_2.o9EF |title=Seth MacFarlane – Biography |publisher=Yahoo! |accessdate=December 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At RISD MacFarlane created a series of independent films, eventually meeting future ''Family Guy'' cast member [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]], whose brother Patrick was MacFarlane's classmate. During his time at RISD, MacFarlane performed stand-up comedy.&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/seth-macfarlane-family-guy-star-trek-247364 |title=Seth MacFarlane Secretly Wants 'Family Guy' to End; Relaunch 'Star Trek' for TV |publisher=''The Hollywood Reporter'' |date=October 12, 2011 |accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his senior year at RISD MacFarlane created a thesis film titled ''[[Larry shorts|The Life of Larry]]'', which eventually would become the inspiration for ''Family Guy''.&lt;ref name="E"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/celebs/c116217_seth_macfarlane.html |title=Seth MacFarlane – Profile |publisher=E!

== Career ==

=== Television career ===

==== Hanna-Barbera years ====
MacFarlane was recruited during the senior film festival by development executive Ellen Cockrill and President [[Fred Seibert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/nicktoons/2006/06/09/seth-macfarlane/ |title=The Nicktoons Network Animation Festival-Seth MacFarlane |publisher=Frederator Studios |date=June 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to work at Hanna-Barbera (then Hanna-Barbera Cartoons) based on the writing content of ''The Life of Larry'', rather than on cartooning ability. He was one of only a few people hired by the company solely based on writing talent.&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; He worked as an animator and writer for [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Cartoon Cartoons]]'' series.&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; He described the atmosphere at Hanna-Barbera as resembling an "old-fashioned Hollywood structure, where you move from one show to another or you jump from a writing job on one show to a storyboard job on another". MacFarlane worked on four television series during his tenure at the studio: ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', and ''[[Johnny Bravo]]''.&lt;ref name="stlouis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=My TV hero: Daniel Roche on Seth MacFarlane |author=Hickman, Leo |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/29/my-tv-hero-seth-macfarlane |publisher=The Guardian |date=August 29, 2011 |accessdate=September 20, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working as both a writer and [[storyboard artist]], MacFarlane spent the most time on ''Johnny Bravo''. He found it easier to develop his own style at ''Johnny Bravo'' through the show's process of scriptwriting, which ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''Cow and Chicken'', and ''I Am Weasel'' did not use.&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; As a part of the ''Johnny Bravo'' crew, MacFarlane met actors and voiceover artists such as [[Adam West]] and [[Jack Sheldon]] of ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'' fame. Meeting these individuals later became significant to the production and success of his ''Family Guy'' series.

He also did freelance work for [[Walt Disney Television Animation]], writing for ''[[Jungle Cubs]]'', and for [[Nelvana]], where he wrote for ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (TV series)|Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]''. Through strict observation of writing elements such as story progression, character stakes and plot points, MacFarlane found the work for Disney was, from a writing standpoint, very valuable in preparation for his career (particularly on ''Ace Ventura'').&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; MacFarlane also created and wrote a short titled ''Zoomates'' for [[Frederator Studios]]' ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' on [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frederatorblogs.com/channel_frederator/2006/02/25/rumor-confirmed/ |title=Rumor Confirmed |date=February 25, 2006 |accessdate=May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, MacFarlane created a sequel to ''The Life of Larry'' entitled ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve|Larry &amp; Steve]]'', which features a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. The short was broadcast as one of [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[What-A-Cartoon!|World Premiere Toons]]''. Executives at Fox saw both ''Larry'' shorts and negotiations soon began for a prime-time animated series.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://greatreporter.com/mambo/content/view/1383/11/|title = Seth MacFarlane – he's the "Family Guy"|accessdate = December 31, 2007|last = Bartlett|first = James|date = March 12, 2007|work = greatreporter.com|publisher = Presswire Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Family Guy'' ====
{{Main|Family Guy}}
Although MacFarlane enjoyed working at Hanna-Barbera, he felt his real calling was for prime-time animation, which would allow a much edgier style of humor.&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; He first pitched ''Family Guy'' to Fox during his tenure at Hanna-Barbera. A development executive for Hanna-Barbera, who was trying to get back into the prime-time business at the time, introduced MacFarlane to Leslie Kolins and Mike Darnell, heads of the alternative comedy department at Fox. After the success of ''[[King of the Hill]]'' in 1997, MacFarlane called Kolins once more to ask about a possible second pitch for the series. The company offered the young writer a strange deal: Fox gave him a budget of US$50,000 to produce a pilot that could lead to a series (most episodes of animated prime-time productions cost at least US$1 million).&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="megadeal"&gt;{{cite news|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|title=Family Guy'' creator seals megadeal|date=May 5, 2008|work=Reuters |url =https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN0435504220080505|accessdate = May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recalling the experience in an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', MacFarlane stated, "I spent about six months with no sleep and no life, just drawing like crazy in my kitchen and doing this pilot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bernard|last=Weinraub|title= The Young Guy Of 'Family Guy'; A 30-Year-Old's Cartoon Hit Makes An Unexpected Comeback|date=July 7, 2007|publisher=The New York Times Company|url =https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/07/arts/young-guy-family-guy-30-year-old-s-cartoon-hit-makes-unexpected-comeback.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2|work =The New York Times|page =2|accessdate = January 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After six months, MacFarlane returned to Fox with a "very, very simply, crudely animated film – with just enough to get the tone of the show across" to present to the executives, who loved the pilot and ordered the series immediately.&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; In July 1998, the Fox Broadcast Company announced the purchase of ''Family Guy'' for a January 1999 debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mink|last=Eric|title= Fox Fine-'Toons Its Midseason Lineup|date=July 24, 1998|publisher=|url =http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/07/24/1998-07-24_fox_fine-_toons_its_midseaso.html|archive-url =https://archive.is/20120906034211/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/07/24/1998-07-24_fox_fine-_toons_its_midseaso.html|dead-url =yes|archive-date =September 6, 2012|work =[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |page =|accessdate = May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Family Guy'' was originally intended to be a series of shorts on ''[[MADtv]]'', much in the same way ''[[The Simpsons]]'' had begun on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' a decade earlier. Negotiations for the show's ''MADtv'' connection fell through early on as a result of budgetary concerns.&lt;ref name="ignint" /&gt; At age 24, MacFarlane was television's youngest executive producer.&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;

''Family Guy'' first aired January 31, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/media-telecommunications/information-services/5639961-1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717064830/http://www.allbusiness.com/media-telecommunications/information-services/5639961-1.html|archivedate=2009-07-17 |title=''Family Guy'' Returns to Production with an Initial Order of 22 New Episodes to Premiere in Early 2005 |date=March 26, 2004 |accessdate=May 31, 2008 |work=Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane's work in animating ''Family Guy'' has been influenced by [[Jackie Gleason]] and Hanna-Barbera along with examples from ''The Simpsons'' and ''[[All in the Family]]''.&lt;ref name="personal"&gt;{{cite news|first=Thomas |last=McLean |title=Seth MacFarlane: ''Family Guy'', ''American Dad!'' |date=June 1, 2007 |publisher=Reed Business |url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117966166.html?nav=eproducer07 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65bly3WCg?url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117966166.html?nav=eproducer07 |archivedate=February 21, 2012 |work=Variety |accessdate=January 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to writing three episodes, "[[Death Has a Shadow]]", "[[Family Guy Viewer Mail 1]]" and "[[North by North Quahog]]", MacFarlane voices ''Family Guy''{{'}}s main male characters – [[Peter Griffin]], [[Stewie Griffin]], [[Brian Griffin]], and [[Glenn Quagmire]] as well as Tom Tucker, his son Jake Tucker, and additional characters. Bolstered by high DVD sales and established fan loyalty, ''Family Guy'' developed into a US$1-billion franchise.&lt;ref name="megadeal" /&gt; On May 4, 2008, after approximately two and a half years of negotiations, MacFarlane reached a US$100-million agreement with Fox to keep ''Family Guy'' and ''American Dad!'' until 2012. The agreement makes him the world's highest paid television writer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddytv.com/articles/family-guy/family-guy-creator-signs-lucra-19173.aspx ''Family Guy'' Creator Signs Lucrative Deal with Fox.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115154922/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/family-guy/family-guy-creator-signs-lucra-19173.aspx |date=January 15, 2016 }} BuddyTV.

MacFarlane's success with ''Family Guy'' has opened doors to other ventures relating to the show. On April 26, 2005, he and composer [[Walter Murphy]] created ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]''. The soundtrack features a Broadway show tune theme, and MacFarlane voiced Stewie in the track "Stewie's Sexy Party".&lt;ref&gt;Spence D.

During the sixth season, episodes of ''Family Guy'' and ''American Dad!'' were delayed from regular broadcast due to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]] (which MacFarlane participated in to support the writers while Fox aired three ''Family Guy'' episodes without MacFarlane's permission).

==== ''American Dad!'' ====
{{Main|American Dad!}}
MacFarlane has a second long-running, successful [[adult animation|adult]] [[animated sitcom|animated series]] in ''American Dad!'' which has been in production since early 2005. To date, ''American Dad!'' is MacFarlane's only animated series never to have suffered an official cancellation, though it did undergo a network relocation from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] to [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] on October 20, 2014, following the show's [[American Dad! (season 11)|11th season]]. TBS announced on July 16, 2013, that they had picked up the series for a 15-episode [[American Dad! (season 12)|12th season]]. Reportedly, the purpose of the network relocation was originally to make room for new animated broadcasts on Fox's now-defunct "[[Animation Domination]]" lineup. It was reported that the relocation of ''American Dad!'' allowed room for other shows, such as ''[[Mulaney]]'' and another animated series from Seth MacFarlane called ''[[Bordertown (2016 TV series)|Bordertown]]''. ''Bordertown'' ran during the 2015–16 television season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bubbleblabber.com/bordertown-being-pushed-til-fox-fall-2015/|title=Bordertown being pushed til FOX Fall 2015?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While MacFarlane regularly does extensive [[voice acting]] work for ''American Dad!'', he has left much of the show's [[creative direction]] up to Weitzman and Barker. MacFarlane has credited this move with helping to give the series its own distinct voice and identity.&lt;ref name="doorly1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sean Doorly |url=http://www.doorly.com/writing/seth-macfarlane.htm |title=Seth MacFarlane Interview |publisher=Doorly.com |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though, as announced on November 4, 2013, Barker departed ''American Dad!'' after 10 seasons of serving as the show's producer/co-[[showrunner]], resulting from creative differences as production for season 11 on TBS commenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/11/american-dad-executive-producerco-showrunner-mike-barker-exits/ |title='American Dad' Executive Producer/Co-Showrunner Mike Barker Exits |publisher=Deadline.com |date=October 30, 2013 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=May 11, 2013, 8:44 am EST |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/05/american-dad-shakeup_n_4218021.html |title='American Dad' Shakeup: Co-Creator Leaving Before TBS Move |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=November 1, 2013 |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''American Dad!'' was first shown after [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], debuting with the episode "[[Pilot (American Dad!)|Pilot]]", which MacFarlane co-wrote.

Because of atypical scheduling of the show's [[American Dad!

What with Barker's departure from the series however, it is unclear if any of these plans have been scrapped or modified in any way.

MacFarlane has described the initial seasons of ''American Dad!'' as being similar to ''[[All in the Family]]'', likening [[title role|title character]] [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]]'s originally [[bigotry|bigoted]] persona to [[Archie Bunker]].&lt;ref name="norton"&gt;Norton James.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071229222114/http://www.flakmag.com/features/macfarlane.html "Seth MacFarlane's Third Act"].

His fellow co-creators have sensed this through MacFarlane's greatly increased attention to the series after its early seasons. MacFarlane has also revealed he is an ''American Dad!'' fan himself. He has taken note of the positive reaction to the "[[Roger (American Dad!)|Roger]]" character by fans via his Twitter.&lt;ref name="by Todd VanDerWerff September 28, 2012" /&gt;

The show focuses on the Smith family: Stan Smith, the endangering, [[wikt: dog-eat-dog|dog-eat-dog]], rash and inconsiderate head of the household. He has an exaggeratedly large chin and masculine manner about him. As the family's [[breadwinner model|breadwinner]], he works as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer and was initially portrayed in the series as an old-fashioned conservative bigot but has since grown out of these traits (the show is known for its [[story arc]] elements and other [[American Dad!#Plot techniques|distinguishing plot techniques]]); Stan's [[wikt: paradox|paradoxically]] moralistic yet simultaneously inappropriate, corrupt wife, [[Francine Smith|Francine]]; and their two children, new-age hippie daughter [[Hayley Smith (American Dad!)|Hayley]] and nerdy son [[Steve Smith (American Dad!)|Steve]].

MacFarlane developed a ''Family Guy'' spin-off called ''The Cleveland Show'', which focuses on the character of [[Cleveland Brown]] and his family.

In 2011, it was announced that MacFarlane would be reviving ''[[The Flintstones#Cancelled Seth MacFarlane reboot|The Flintstones]]'' for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network, with the first episode airing in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/1/willllllllllmmmmaaa-animated-flinstones-to-be-resurrected-by-seth-macfarlane/|title=Willllllllllmmmmaaa!

Regarding Broadway, MacFarlane told ''The Hollywood Reporter'', "If I did a Broadway musical, I'd probably want to do something a little bit more old-fashioned", and went on saying "I wouldn't necessarily do something that was as edgy as what they &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Book of Mormon (musical)|have done]]. The challenge to me would be more along the lines of, gosh, can somebody write ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' for 2011?"&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter" /&gt; He has also said that, "The good thing about Broadway is that you don't have to worry about an airdate.

In late 2011, it was confirmed that MacFarlane is working on another animated series with [[Alex Borstein]] and [[Gary Janetti]].

MacFarlane appeared on the November 11, 2006 episode of Fox's comedy show ''[[MADtv]]'' and performed a live action re-enactment of a scene from the ''Family Guy'' episode "[[Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High]]". In the scene, Peter and Lois suspect [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] of murdering his teacher's husband. As a reaction, a terrified Meg jumps out the window. For the live-action sequence, besides MacFarlane, [[Nicole Parker]] played Lois, [[Ike Barinholtz]] played Chris, [[Nicole Randall Johnson]] played Meg, and [[Keegan-Michael Key]] played Stewie. According to MacFarlane, the live-action thing didn't work at all and to make matters somewhat worse, when Johnson jumped out the window, her face was believed to be covered with fake blood. After that clip, MacFarlane showed the same scene, but with celebrities who didn't pay attention to the script. [[Kathy Griffin]], [[Dane Cook]], [[Queen Latifah]], and [[Snoop Dogg]] voiced Lois, Chris, Meg, and Stewie, respectively. They messed up their lines so badly that MacFarlane, in his Peter voice, screamed "The script, guys! Come on!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awn.com/news/television/mad-tv-gets-more-animated-fox "MAD TV Gets More Animated on FOX"]. AWN Headline News. November 2, 2006.

==== LGBT issues ====

A man with gray hair, looking straight forward, and wearing suit, sits behind him.|MacFarlane speaking at a ceremony for [[Bill Maher]] to receive a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in September 2010]]
MacFarlane is passionate about his support for [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay rights]]. In 2008 he called it "infuriating and idiotic" that two gay partners "have to go through this fucking [[Dog and pony show|dog and pony act]] when they stop at a hotel and the guy behind the counter says, 'You want one room or two?'" He went on to say, "I'm incredibly passionate about my support for the gay community and what they're dealing with at this current point in time".&lt;ref name=Advocate2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/news/2008/01/25/bgf-seth-macfarlane|title=BGF: Seth MacFarlane|publisher=Advocate|author=Voss, Brandon|accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane continued, "Why is it that Johnny Spaghetti Stain in fucking [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] can knock a woman up, legally be married to her, and then beat the shit out of her, but these two intelligent, sophisticated writers who have been together for 20 years can't get married?"&lt;ref name=Advocate2 /&gt;

MacFarlane, in recognition of "his active, passionate commitment to [[humanism|humanist]] values, and his fearless support of equal marriage rights and other social justice issues", was named the Harvard Humanist of the Year in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harvardhumanist.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=166:seth-macfarlane-harvard-humanist-of-the-year-2011&amp;catid=6:latest-news&amp;Itemid=38|work=Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard|title=Seth MacFarlane, Harvard Humanist of the Year 2011!|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, MacFarlane was criticized for his portrayal of [[transsexualism]] in the ''Family Guy'' episode "[[Quagmire's Dad]]". Gay novelist [[Brent Hartinger]] found the episode's inclusion of [[transphobia|transphobic]] remarks from Peter and [[Lois Griffin]]—as well as a scene of Brian vomiting profusely upon discovering his new girlfriend to be [[Glenn Quagmire]]'s father—to be "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, "Frankly, it's literally ''impossible'' for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I come to the conclusion that the man is pretty much a complete idiot".&lt;ref name="aeidiot"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hartinger, Brent |title=Is Family Guy's Seth MacFarlane a Complete Idiot? |publisher=AfterElton.com |date=May 10, 2010 |url=http://www.afterelton.com/TV/2010/5/seth-macfarlane-complete-idiot |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513151543/http://www.afterelton.com/TV/2010/5/seth-macfarlane-complete-idiot |archivedate=May 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]], a LGBT media watchdog organization, shared "serious concerns being voiced from members of the community" about the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Rosales, Jonathan| title = GLAAD Shares Community Concerns About Last Night's Family Guy| publisher = [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] | date =May 10, 2010| url = http://glaadblog.org/2010/05/10/glaad-shares-community-concerns-about-last-nights-family-guy/| accessdate =May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane said he was "surprised" by the negative reaction to "Quagmire's Dad", saying that "it seemed that [gay commentators] were not picking up on the fact that it was a very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He further added, "Look, Brian happens to be a [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] character, as I am. If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a [[vagina]] and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'"&lt;ref&gt;Amy Wallace (2010-08).

After the fact, it was sobering, but people have a lot of close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive.

=== Lawsuits ===
On October 3, 2007, [[Bourne Co. Music Publishers]] filed a lawsuit accusing ''Family Guy'' of [[copyright infringement|infringing its copyright]] on the song "[[When You Wish upon a Star]]", through a parody song titled "I Need a Jew" appearing in the episode "[[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein]]". Bourne Co., which holds the copyright, alleged the parody pairs a "thinly veiled" copy of their music with [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] lyrics. Named in the suit were MacFarlane, [[20th Century Fox Film Corporation|20th Century Fox Film Corp.]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Broadcasting Co.]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Walter Murphy]]; the suit sought to stop the program's distribution and asked for unspecified damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Bourne Co., vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Fox Broadcasting Company, Twentieth Century Fox Television, Inc., Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Inc., Fuzzy Door Productions, Inc., The Cartoon Network, Inc., Seth MacFarlane, Walter Murphy |court=[[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|United States District Court, Southern District of New York]] |date=October 3, 2007|accessdate=September 5, 2010|url=http://www.schwimmerlegal.com/family%20guy%20complaint.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourne argued that "I Need a Jew" uses the copyrighted melody of "When You Wish Upon a Star" without commenting on that song, and that it was therefore not a [[First Amendment]]-protected parody per the ruling in ''[[Campbell v.

In December 2007, ''Family Guy'' was again accused of copyright infringement when actor [[Art Metrano]] filed a lawsuit regarding a scene in ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'', in which Jesus performs Metrano's signature magic parody act, involving absurd faux magical hand gestures while humming the distinctive tune "[[Fine and Dandy (song)|Fine and Dandy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/12/06/6128/magician_sues_over_cartoon_jesus |title=Magician sues over cartoon Jesus |work=Chortle |accessdate=September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane, [[20th Century Fox]], [[Steve Callaghan]], and Alex Borstein were all named in the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Arthur Metrano, vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Seth MacFarlane, Steve Callaghan and Alex Borstein |court=[[United States District Court for the Central District of California|United States District Court, Central District of California]] |accessdate=April 27, 2010|date=December 5, 2007|url=http://www.aolcdn.com/tmz_documents/1206_metrano_fox_wm.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, a federal district court judge rejected Fox's motion to dismiss, saying that the first three fair use factors involved—"purpose and character of the use", "nature of the infringed work", and "amount and substantiality of the taking"—counted in Metrano's favor, while the fourth—"economic impact"—had to await more fact-finding. In denying the dismissal, the court held that the reference in the scene made light of Jesus and his followers—not Metrano or his act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Metrano v.

On July 16, 2014, MacFarlane was served with a lawsuit from the production company of a series of Internet videos called ''Charlie the Abusive Teddy Bear'' claiming that ''Ted'' infringes on the copyright of its videos due to the Ted bear largely matching the background story, persona, voice tone, attitude, and dialogue of the Charlie bear.&lt;ref name="lawsuit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/16/showbiz/charlie-versus-ted-lawsuit/|title=Lawsuit: Seth MacFarlane's 'Ted' ripped off 'Charlie the Abusive Bear'|first=Alan|last=Duke|accessdate=July 16, 2014|date=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was dropped on March 23, 2015, after the plaintiffs withdrew the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.hollywoodreporter.com/v/MoviesNews/SethMcfarlaneBeats03|title=Seth MacFarlane Beats ''Ted'' Lawsuit With Independently Created Bear|accessdate=March 25, 2015|date=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
