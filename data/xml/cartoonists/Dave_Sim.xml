'''Dave Sim''' (born 17 May 1956) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] cartoonist and publisher, best known for his comic book ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark|Cerebus]]'', his artistic experimentation, his advocacy of [[self-publishing]] and [[creator's rights]], and his controversial political, philosophical and religious beliefs.

Sim rose to prominence with ''Cerebus'', which began in December 1977. Sim initially conceived it as a parody of ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' and other [[sword and sorcery]] comics, but after two years began to consider the series a self-contained work that would run for 300 issues and be subdivided into "[[Graphic novel|novels]]". By the time the 6000-page work was completed in March 2004, Sim had delved into [[politics]], [[theology]], [[metaphysics]], and a controversial examination of [[feminism]] and gender, while becoming progressively more sophisticated and experimental in his storytelling and artwork. Sim worked on ''Cerebus Archives'' afterward, and produced the comic books ''[[Glamourpuss (comics)|Glamourpuss]]'', which examines the history of photorealistic comics, and ''[[Judenhass (comics)|Judenhass]]'', about the [[Holocaust]].

Sim co-founded the [[small press]] publisher [[Aardvark-Vanaheim]] with his wife-to-be, [[Deni Loubert]], in 1977. Most of the titles it published moved to Loubert's [[Renegade Press]] after the couple's divorce in the mid-1980s.  The publishing company later was co-owned by Sim's creative partner, [[Gerhard (cartoonist)|Gerhard]], who dissolved their partnership and sold his stake in the company to Sim in 2007.

Sim helped create the [[Creator's Bill of Rights]] in 1988. He has criticized the use of [[copyright]] to restrict creators, and has arranged for his body of work to fall into the [[public domain]] following his death.

==Early life==
Sim was born 17 May 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller |first=John Jackson |authorlink=John Jackson Miller |url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |title=Comics Industry Birthdays |work=[[Comics Buyer's Guide]] |date=June 10, 2005 |location=Iola, Wisconsin |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5trAbNQWw?url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |archivedate=October 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a factory supervisor at [[Budd Company|Budd Automotive]], and did work as a labour negotiator.{{sfn|Hoffman|2012|p=7}}

He became interested in comic books when he was eight. [[Berni Wrightson]] ''Badtime Stories'' (1971) inspired him to devote himself to drawing.{{sfn|Hoffman|2012|p=8}} Sim also found inspiration in ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, particularly [[Harvey Kurtzman]] and [[Wally Wood]]'s "Superduperman" parody, as well as [[Underground comix|underground]] cartoonist [[Jaxon|Jack Jackson]]'s ''Conan'' parody.{{sfn|Hoffman|2012|pp=9–10}}

He wrote and drew comics throughout his adolescence, and began submitting work to [[fanzine]]s. His first published work was some articles in the comics [[fanzine]] ''[[Rocket's Blast Comicollector]]''. He had submitted artwork as well, and although it was rejected, Sim struck up a relationship with editor Gabe Quintanilla, who encouraged him to continue submitting material. [[Now &amp; Then Books]] owner Harry Kremer allowed him to produce a newsletter called ''Now &amp; Then Times''. The first issue arrived in summer 1972. Sim produced another issue in 1973, but had begun devoting his time to John Balge's ''Comic Art News and Reviews'', another Canadian comics fanzine.  For ''CANAR'' he did interviews with subjects such as Barry Windsor-Smith.{{sfn|Hoffman|2012|pp=8–9}} Sim also worked on ''Oktoberfest Comics'', a [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] published by Kramer.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} He became friends with artist [[Gene Day]] in 1974. The two worked together on a proposed character called the Partisan, which they hoped would run in Jim Waley's ''Orb Magazine''.  

Inspired by [[Charles Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts (comic strip)|Peanuts]]'' and ''Outhouses of the North'', a small book of cartoons published by Norther Ontario's Highway Bookshop, Sim spent 1975 and 1976 developing a comic strip called ''The Beavers''. Highway Bookshop published the strip as a book in 1976. A second book failed to materialize when the publisher shut down. Sim then pursued syndication, pitching ''The Beavers'' to the ''[[Kitchener-Waterloo Record]]''. With Day inking the strips, a year's worth was produced in three days.{{sfn|Hoffman|2012|pp=12–13}} Sim also wrote or drew stories published in anthologies such as ''Phantacea''&lt;ref name=phantacea&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim McPherson's Phantacea Mythos Online |url=http://home.istar.ca/~jmcp/phhome1.htm |accessdate=2007-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514190503/http://home.istar.ca/~jmcp/phhome1.htm |archivedate=2007-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Star*Reach''. ''The Beavers'' also saw print in ''Star*Reach's'' sister [[funny animal]]s comic ''Quack!''.

Around this time, Sim had work published by [[Charlton Comics]] and [[Warren Publishing]].{{sfn|Hoffman|2012|p=10}}  In 1976, Sim took the only job he ever held outside of comics, as an employee at [[Now &amp; Then Books]].{{sfn|Walcoff|2007}}

==Career==

===''Cerebus''===
In December 1977, Sim began publishing ''Cerebus'', an initially bi-monthly, black-and-white comic book series. It began as a [[parody|parodic]] cross between [[Conan the Barbarian]] and [[Howard the Duck]]. Progressively, Sim shifted his narrative style to story arcs of a few issues' length.  Soon he moved to longer, far more complex "novels", beginning with the 25-issue storyline ''[[High Society (comics)|High Society]]'' which began in issue #26. The [[sword and sorcery]] elements in the series, prominent up to that point, were minimized as Sim concentrated more on [[politics]] and [[religion]].

''Cerebus'' was published through Sim's company, [[Aardvark-Vanaheim]], which was run by his wife, [[Deni Loubert]]. The two met in 1976, married in 1979, and divorced after nearly five years of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;"Cerebus Biweekly" #6, Feb 1989, inside front cover. [[Aardvark-Vanaheim]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, during a time when he was taking large doses of [[LSD]], Sim was hospitalized for treatment of [[schizophrenia]]-like symptoms.&lt;ref name="Tinker"&gt;Tinker, Emma (2008) ''[http://emmatinker.oxalto.co.uk/thesis/ Identity and Form in Alternative Comics, 1967 - 2007]'', University College of London, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It was about this time that Sim began to envision ''Cerebus'' as a single, lengthy story that would run exactly 300 issues, ending with the lead character's death.  25 years later, in 2004, Sim's plan was fulfilled with the 300th and last issue.

In the 1980s, Sim traveled widely to promote ''Cerebus'', which became a very successful independently-produced comic book, with a circulation peaking at 36,000 copies. In 1984 he began a collaboration with [[Gerhard (cartoonist)|Gerhard]], who handled the background artwork in the series. Aardvark-Vanaheim, managed by Loubert, began publishing other comics besides ''Cerebus'', such as [[William Messner-Loebs]]' ''[[Journey (comics)|Journey]]'' and [[Bob Burden]]'s ''[[Flaming Carrot]]''. After Sim and Loubert's separation, Loubert started [[Renegade Press]], which assumed publishing duties for all non-''Cerebus'' Aardvark-Vanaheim titles in 1985.

Although Sim did not maintain a consistent monthly schedule for the entire run, which at times required an accelerated production schedule to catch up, he completed the ''Cerebus'' series on schedule in March 2004.  As the series progressed, it was noted for its tendency towards artistic experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Wolk, Douglas. ''Reading comics: how graphic novels work and what they mean''.  Da Capo Press, 2007.  {{ISBN|978-0-306-81509-6}}. "[Sim] routinely pulls off technical feats that no other cartoonist would dare." (page 295)&lt;/ref&gt;  Sim has called the complete run of Cerebus a 6,000-page novel,&lt;ref&gt;Sim, Dave. ''Cerebus Number Zero'' ("Note from the President", inside front cover). [[Aardvark-Vanaheim]], June 1993. {{ISSN|0712-7774}}. "Cerebus is a six thousand page story-line, documenting the ups and downs of a single character's life (as well as the lives of those around him)."&lt;/ref&gt; a view shared by several academic writers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.comixpress.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=21_31&amp;products_id=1522&amp;zenid=oaql6ak5hob2ln8o2jk2l1iml7

"The Greatest Story Almost Told: The most ambitious comic ever turns 20". [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]], December 1997. "From the start, Sim planned ''Cerebus'' as a 300-issue, 6,000-page epic, the action revolving around an aardvark in a medieval city-state who becomes a prime minister, then a pope, then a bartender."&lt;/ref&gt; and comics historians.&lt;ref&gt;Wolk, Douglas. "Aardvark Politick", September 2005. "Dave Sim’s 6,000-plus-page Cerebus is a Deeply Misogynistic Graphic Novel about an Anthropomorphic, Hermaphroditic Aardvark. And it’s an Absolute Masterpiece."; "In March of last year, the Canadian cartoonist Dave Sim published the final twenty-page installment of Cerebus, the 6,000-plus-page comic-book epic he’d been writing and drawing since 1977."
&lt;/ref&gt;

He purchased Gerhard's stake in Aardvark-Vanaheim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/cerebus/message/107509|title=Gerhard and Aardvark-Vanaheim have parted ways.|accessdate=2007-02-28|work=Cerebus Yahoo!

===Post-''Cerebus'' work===
Following the completion of ''Cerebus'' in 2004, Sim produces occasional guest work, goes to conventions and regularly attends city council meetings, provides interviews and art for a Texas-based magazine called ''Following Cerebus'', and provided commentary and reports on Kitchener politics for two local magazines (called ''Xen'' and ''Versus'').

As of 2006, Sim was working on the Cerebus [[Archive]] Project, an [[online]] searchable [[database]] of Cerebus materials. Sim is also in the process of reading the [[Gospel]]s and The [[Book of Revelation]] out of [[Brooke Foss Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]]'s 1881 [[interlinear]] [[Greek language|Greek]] to English [[translation]] of The [[New Testament]] semi-weekly and taking notes. He wrote that he plans to publish a [[Bible commentary|commentary]] on it, using [[Chester Brown]]'s artwork for the [[Gospel of Mark]] from Brown's unfinished gospel project as illustrations. Sim wrote he may make his notes available as a free digital book. This project was discussed in ''Collected Letters: 2004'', and in recent letters between Sim and his readers.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Beginning in 2006, Sim began publishing an online comic-book biography of Canadian actress [[Siu Ta]] titled ''[[Siu Ta, So Far]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urge2film.com/index.php?go=12 Excerpt of Episode 1 of ''Siu Ta, So Far''], Urge2film.com&lt;/ref&gt;
In late 2006 and early 2007, Sim conducted public readings of the 1611 [[King James Bible]] at the Registry Theatre in Kitchener in order to raise money for the Food Bank of Waterloo Region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://davesim.blogspot.com/2006/11/dave-sims-blogandmail-76-november-26th.html Dave Sim's Blog &amp; Mail] entry from November 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007, Sim announced two projects. One, which he initially referred to only as "Secret Project One", is ''Judenhass'' (German for "Jew hatred"), a 56-page "personal reflection on The Holocaust" which was released on May 28, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judenhass.com/ |title=Dave Sim – Judenhass |publisher=Judenhass.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is ''[[glamourpuss (comics)|glamourpuss]]'', a comic-book series which is a combined parody of fashion magazines (wherein Sim traces photos from real fashion magazines) and a historical study of the [[photorealist]] style of comic-strip art, for which he did a promotional "tour" of online forums related to comics in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glamourpusscomic.com/ |title='&amp;#39;Glamourpuss'&amp;#39; |publisher=Glamourpusscomic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 2009, Sim began publishing ''Cerebus Archive'', a bimonthly presentation of his work before and surrounding ''Cerebus''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Craig. [http://www.comicsvillage.com/column.aspx?ArticleID=516 ''Dave Sim's Cerebus Archive'' #1] ComicsVillage.com, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 2009 the first episode of the web series ''Cerebus TV'' premiered. The show airs new episodes Fridays at 10 pm Eastern time, which then stream continuously throughout the week. Credits list Dave Sim as the executive producer. He is often the central hub of the shows, either interviewing comics legends or showing behind the scenes at Aardvark-Vanaheim. As of early 2013, there have been approximately 115 episodes of Cerebus TV.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In 2011, BOOM! Town announced that in 2012 it would publish ''Dave Sim's Last Girlfriend'', a collection of letters between Dave Sim and Susan Alston originally intended for Denis Kitchen's Kitchen Sink Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/11/16/boom-to-publish-dave-sim%E2%80%99s-last-girlfriend/|title=Boom! Town To Publish Dave Sim’s Last Girlfriend|last=Johnston|first=Rich|date=November 16, 2011|work=Bleedingcool.com|publisher=Avatar Press|accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of academic essays about ''Cerebus'' was published in 2012 by McFarland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6889-8|title=''Cerebus the Barbarian Messiah: Essays on the Epic Graphic Satire of Dave Sim and Gerhard''|editor=Eric Hoffman|publisher=McFarland Press|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appeared the 2012 end of ''Glamourpuss'' would mean the end of ''The Strange Death of Alex Raymond'' which was running in it; in 2013 it was announced [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] would publish the series in a reworked edition, as well as handle a number of other projects, including a ''Cerebus'' cover collection.&lt;ref&gt;Khouri, Andy (July 20, 2013).

==Legacy==
Sim's use of an extended, multi-layered storytelling canvas, divided in large arcs divided in mostly self-contained issues, was acknowledged by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] as his inspiration for the structure of ''[[Babylon 5]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Straczynski, J. Michael. "Dave Sim: Marathon Man", ''Following Cerebus #7'', February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Creators' rights===
During the 1980s and early 1990s, Sim used his [[leverage (finance)|sales leverage]] from ''Cerebus'' to act as a major proponent and advocate of creator's rights and [[self-publishing]]. After [[the Puma Blues|the ''Puma Blues'' distribution incident]], he helped write the [[Creators' Bill of Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottmccloud.com/inventions/bill/bill_of_rights.html |title=The Creators' Bill of Rights at |publisher=Scottmccloud.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Scott McCloud]], and [[Kevin Eastman]] and [[Peter Laird]], creators of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]. In addition to speaking on these topics at [[comic book conventions]] (as in his 1993 PRO/con speech&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cerebusfangirl.com/artists/nftp/procon.php |title=Text of Sim's 1993 PRO-Con speech at |publisher=Cerebusfangirl.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Sim also published the seminal ''The Cerebus Guide to Self-Publishing'' in 1997, which instructed readers on the practical matters of how to successfully self-publish their own comics. Sim often promoted other creators' fledgling work in the back pages of ''Cerebus''.

Sim has criticized the use of [[copyright]]s to restrict the use of creations which would have more quickly become public domain under earlier copyright law.&lt;ref name="cerebusfangirl"/&gt; He has stated that other creators are free to use his characters in their own works, which he characterizes as an attempt to be consistent with his own appropriation of others' works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davesim.blogspot.com/2007/07/dave-sims-blogandmail-302-july-10th.html |title=Dave Sim's blog, July 10, 2007 |publisher=Davesim.blogspot.com |date=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showpost.php?p=5113840&amp;postcount=83 Newsarama discussion, Feb 6, 2008]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misogyny===

In the course of writing ''Cerebus'', Sim expressed opposition to feminism and made controversial statements regarding men and women. Sim expressed his views on gender in issue #186 of ''Cerebus'', in a text piece as part of the story arc "Reads" (one of four books in the larger "Mothers &amp; Daughters" arc), using the pseudonym Viktor Davis. Among the various theories expounded upon in the piece, Sim's alter-ego Viktor Davis categorizes humanity into metaphorical ''lights'', which tended to reside in biological men, and ''voids'', which tended to be in biological women. He characterized Voids as "without a glimmer of understanding of intellectual processes" and declared that "Light does not Breed".

In 1995, ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #174 featured a [[Bill Willingham]] caricature of Sim on one of the covers, bearing the title "Dave Sim: [[misogyny|Misogynist]] Guru of Self-Publishers". Inside was a lengthy article written by [[Jonathan Hagey]] and [[Kim Thompson]] that published responses from comics creators such as [[Alan Moore]], [[Seth (cartoonist)|Seth]], [[Rick Veitch]], [[Steve Bissette]], and Sim's friend and fellow Canadian [[Chester Brown]]. The responses ranged from anger to a belief that Sim was joking. Others would later speculate that Sim was suffering from a mental illness related to his heavy drug use in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Tinker" /&gt; The article also included a short interview with Sim's ex-wife, wherein she described the essay as evidence of Sim being "very scared". Accompanying the article was an illustration of Sim as a [[nazism|Nazi]] German [[concentration camp]] warden, standing before a gate with the name of his publishing company, with emaciated camp prisoners behind the fence. In the essay in ''Cerebus'' #186, Sim characterized fellow self-publishing cartoonist [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] as an example of a man dominated by his wife. When Smith contested this,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boneville.com/bone/bone-history/#feud | title=The Feud with Dave Sim | last=Smith | first=Jeff | authorlink=Jeff Smith (cartoonist) | work=[[Boneville]] |  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223210611/http://www.boneville.com/bone/bone-history/#feud | archivedate=2007-02-23 | accessdate=2014-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sim accused Smith of lying and challenged Smith to a [[boxing|boxing match]], which Smith declined.&lt;ref name="ComicsJournal"&gt;Dean, Micheal (2001). [http://www.tcj.com/234/n_sim.html "In the Company of Sim"]. ''[[The Comics Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Sim published another essay, "Tangent", in ''Cerebus'' #265 (April 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Sim, Dave. [http://www.theabsolute.net/misogyny/tangents.html "Tangent"]. TheAbsolute.net&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Sim furthered the themes from "Reads", describing the tangent he contends [[western culture|western society]] has taken due to the widespread acceptance and proliferation of feminism, beginning in 1970. ''The Comics Journal'' posted the full essay on its website, although a short introduction by staff distanced the ''Journal'' from the ideas therein, calling them "nutty and loathsome". The following issue included a rebuttal to the first "Tangent" by "Ruthie Penmark". Several years later, in issue #263, the ''Journal'' devoted a section to discussion of ''Cerebus''. It reprinted a 2001 essay by Renee Stephen, "Masculinity's Last Hope, or Creepily Paranoid Misogynist?: An Open Letter to Dave Sim",&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcj.com/263/e_stephen.html Stephen, R.S.; "Masculinity's Last Hope, or Creepily Paranoid Misogynist? An Open Letter to Dave Sim"; tcj.com; Reprinted from ''The Comics Journal'' #263] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413041011/http://archives.tcj.com/263/e_stephen.html |date=April 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; addressing the "Tangent" controversy. Sim's reply to Stephen, and Stephen's reply to Sim's reply, were published in ''The Comics Journal'' # 266.

Despite the description of his views and his reputation as a misogynist,&lt;ref name=ComicsJournal/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theabsolute.net/misogyny/sim.html#texts |title=Writings from "Reads" by Dave Sim; |publisher=Theabsolute.net |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/02/02/spawn-compendium-20-years-todd-mcfarlane/ |title=Spawn 20 Years Later: Looking Back at the Quintessential '90s Comic Book; |publisher=[[Comics Alliance]] |date=2012-02-02 |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205034443/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/02/02/spawn-compendium-20-years-todd-mcfarlane |archivedate=2012-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sim maintains that he is not one.&lt;ref name=picofdavesformletter&gt;{{cite web|last=Sim|first=Dave|title=Dave Sim's form letter|url=http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ixm3LgR91qe0nur.jpg|accessdate=2015-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Sim sent out a self-written form letter to individuals who had sent him mail, detailing his disagreement with being called a misogynist and disenchantment with what he perceived as a dearth of support in refuting those claims to his character. Contending that society perceived misogynists as the "lowest, subhuman form of life in our society", he mentioned that few, if any, people had defended him, allowing him to be called "the lowest, subhuman form of life in our society with impunity." Sim's letter ended with an [[ultimatum]], requesting that those who wished to receive his return correspondence reply with a letter or online posting and the statement, "I do not believe Dave Sim is a misogynist." All others were asked not to attempt to contact him again.&lt;ref name=picofdavesformletter/&gt;

===Relationship with ''The Comics Journal''===
The coverage of his writings about feminism was not the only subject of Sim's conflict with ''The Comics Journal''. He and [[Gary Groth]], editor-in-chief of ''[[The Comics Journal]]'', have had a combative relationship over the years. The magazine was the first{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} to publish a review of the first dozen or so issues of ''Cerebus'', by [[Kim Thompson]] in December 1979, who called ''Cerebus'' "a true heir to [[Carl Barks]]' duck stories".{{sfn|Thompson|1979|p=25}}

Early in the 1990s, Groth took issue with Sim's stance of self-publishing as the best option for creators, and began to disseminate the view that it was best to work for a publisher, mentioning [[Ivan Boesky]]'s address to the University of California's commencement ceremony in May 1986, where Boesky informed his audience that "greed is all right, by the way. I want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself."{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Later, on a panel at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] Groth indicted Sim in what Sim characterized as a "[[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg]]-style tribunal designed to bring to light the most deserving criminals who had over the past decade and longer besmirched the good name of the comics art and industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=70 |title=The Comics Journal - The Comics Journal Performs a Public Service |publisher=Archives.tcj.com |date=1999-10-08 |accessdate=2011-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323162622/http://archives.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=70 |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this adversarial relationship, Groth later published an issue of the ''Journal'' featuring a critical roundtable on the series.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

==Theology and philosophy==
Following his reading of the [[Bible]] and the [[Qur'an]] beginning in December 1996, Sim underwent a [[religious conversion]] from [[atheism|atheist]] [[secular humanism]] to his own mixture of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s. Sim's beliefs are based on the premise that conflicts in scripture are the result of an ongoing argument between the true male God and Yoowhoo, a false female God.&lt;ref&gt;Sim, Dave. (2007) ''[[Latter Days (comics)|Latter Days]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He lives a lifestyle of [[fasting]], [[celibacy]], [[prayer]], and [[alms|alms-giving]], and considers [[religious text|scriptures]] from the [[Jewish]] (the [[Torah]], and [[Nevi'im]]), [[Christian]] (the [[Canonical gospels|Gospels]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] and the [[Book of Revelation]]), and [[Islam]]ic (the [[Qur'an]]) religions to be equally valid as the Word of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;"Just to be clear on the subject of what I consider scripture: the Torah, that is, the Law and the Prophets as held by Orthodox Judaism (i.e. no Ruth, no Esther, no Daniel, no Job, no Song of Songs, etc.), the First Book of Moshe through to Malachi, the four Gospels, Acts and John's Apocalypse, and all of the Koran." Sim, Dave. (2007) ''Collected Letters Volume 2'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; He explored theological themes heavily in the later issues of ''Cerebus''.

==Health==
Due to a wrist condition, Dave Sim has been physically unable to draw since February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/dave-sims-wrist-injury-may-prevent-him-from-ever-drawing-again/|title=Dave Sim’s wrist injury may prevent him from ever drawing again|first=Heidi|last=MacDonald|date=December 19, 2016|work=The Beat|accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began making signs of recovery in 2017, and did his first new drawing of Cerebus on September 29, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzM26dCdYjM&lt;/ref&gt;
