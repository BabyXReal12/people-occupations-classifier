      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7857">'''Jim Bamber''' (1948 – 20 June 2014) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[artist]] and [[editorial cartoonist]] specialising in [[motorsport]], who is best known for his motor racing related [[caricature]]s which incorporate his distinctive driver &lt;!--[[character design]] links to a literary article--&gt;designs, that now adorn every issue of ''[[Autosport]]'' magazines as well as his annual compilation of cartoons from the magazine called ''The Pits''.

==Background==
Bamber was born in [[Preston, Lancashire]] in 1948. After completing his studies at the Harris College of Art (now part of [[University of Central Lancashire]]) in Preston,&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.jimbamber.co.uk/cgi-bin/page.pl?title=&amp;page=biog Jim Bamber bio page]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522125746/http://www.jimbamber.co.uk/cgi-bin/page.pl?title=&amp;page=biog |date=May 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he moved to [[London]] to pursue a career as an artist, where he worked in numerous renowned publications and would soon gradually become freelance. There he worked for ''[[Car Magazine]]'' which led to a stint at the publisher of ''[[Autocourse]]''.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

==Yumping Yarns/The Pits==
During his time as an [[illustrator]], looking at a picture of [[Stig Blomqvist]] in his driver's overall and helmet, Bamber began to practice cartoon drawing of drivers in overalls and a full-face helmet, of whom Blomqvist was the first caricature drawn by Bamber.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onpole.com/the_jim_bamber_collection/jim_bambers_the_stig_figure-c165303p165305.html OnPole.com:Jim Bamber's 'The Stig' Figure] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041340/http://www.onpole.com/the_jim_bamber_collection/jim_bambers_the_stig_figure-c165303p165305.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than drawing faces of drivers, a common feature at the time, he shortcutted it by drawing a ball as a helmet and adding names above their visors to identify drivers.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; Bamber would continue to practice drawing drivers' caricatures, while working as an illustrator and as an Art Editor for [[Rallycourse]] yearbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjmautotechnik.com/books/rallybk_rallycourse.htm |title=SJM Autotechnik |publisher=SJM Autotechnik |date= |accessdate=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Bamber took his first commissioned job as a cartoonist for the monthly car magazine [[Car &amp; Car Conversions]], titled ''"[[Hill jumping|Yumping]] Yarns"'', to which he contributed monthly specialising in [[World Championship Rallying]].&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; This was followed by a stint for [[Autosport]] for a cartoon now known as ''"Bamber's view"'', specialising mostly in topics related to [[Formula One]]. Although appearing regularly in the magazine, his cartoon became a weekly feature in 1994 which continues to this day.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; In addition, Bamber also created a short lived comic strip called ''"Bumpa the Bear"'' that appeared weekly in [[Auto Express]] from 1991 to 1992.

By 1988, his drivers' caricatures had evolved from a lanky goggle-eyed character to a dumpier version. Bamber used this design for the rest of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Yumping Yarns, Tudor Journals, 1989, {{ISBN|0-907520-18-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[Stirling Moss]] became the only driver to have been given his own distinctive helmeted design, differing from Bamber's standard full face helmet style, incorporating his overalls, [[helmet]] and [[goggle]] that he had worn during his professional career, with which he has become associated. His cartoon incorporates a [[Damon Hill]] fan being asked a question by an [[ITV Network|ITV]] F1 correspondent, "Who's the greatest driver"; he is threatened at gunpoint from behind by a [[Michael Schumacher]] caricature, who in turn is threatened at gunpoint from behind by Moss, who says, "Moss - pass it on!".&lt;ref name=pits6&gt;Jim Bamber, The Pits 6: 1998 Edition, Page 81, {{ISBN|0-86024-933-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimbamber.co.uk/CARTOONS/1998/9829.jpg Bamber's cartoon of Schumacher and Moss]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927120329/http://www.jimbamber.co.uk/CARTOONS/1998/9829.jpg |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamber claimed the cartoon was not as funny with only Schumacher; as such, he drew in Moss, and found that it increased the humor of the cartoon.

There have been many people who have been given their own caricatures, namely top-line personnel including [[Bernie Ecclestone]], incorporating his suit and sunglasses (which often include the dollar symbol on the lenses), and [[Max Mosley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimbamber.co.uk/cgi-bin/jbpage.pl?action=page&amp;page=2005/0519&amp;title=Max%20&amp;%20Bernie Bamber's cartoon of Max &amp; Bernie] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927120245/http://www.jimbamber.co.uk/cgi-bin/jbpage.pl?action=page&amp;page=2005%2F0519&amp;title=Max%20&amp;%20Bernie |date=2007-09-27 }} with [[Uncle Sam]] and [[Michelin Man]] in regards to the [[2005 United States Grand Prix]] &lt;/ref&gt; and team managers including [[Jean Todt]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimbamber.co.uk/cgi-bin/jbpage.pl?action=page&amp;page=2002/0239&amp;title=Fokker Bamber's cartoon of Todt and Schumacher] in a [[Fokker Triplane]]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927120221/http://www.jimbamber.co.uk/cgi-bin/jbpage.pl?action=page&amp;page=2002%2F0239&amp;title=Fokker |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimbamber.co.uk/cgi-bin/jbpage.pl?action=page&amp;page=1994/9422&amp;title=Now%20Without%20Grinding%20Your%20Teeth Bamber's cartoon] of Frank Williams and [[Damon Hill]] {{Dead link |date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ron Dennis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimbamber.co.uk/cgi-bin/jbpage.pl?action=page&amp;page=1994/9402&amp;title=One%20Day%20my%20Prost%20Will%20Come Bamber's cartoon interpretation] of [[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]] {{Dead link |date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and drivers, sans helmet, such as [[Mika Häkkinen]] and [[Michael Schumacher]]&lt;ref name=pits6 /&gt; as well as celebrities, for instance [[Victoria Beckham|Posh]] and [[David Beckham|Becks]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimbamber.co.uk/cgi-bin/jbpage.pl?action=page&amp;title=Posh%20&amp;%20Becks&amp;page=2007/0718 Bamber's cartoon] of [[Lewis Hamilton]] with Posh &amp; Becks {{Dead link |date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large [[mural]] illustrated by Bamber is in the cafe of [[Castle Combe Circuit]].
