'''Allan''' "'''Al'''" '''Jaffee''' (born '''Abraham Jaffee''',{{sfn|Wiesman|2010|pp=152&amp;ndash;53}} March 13, 1921) is an American [[cartoonist]]. He is notable for his work in the [[satire|satirical]] magazine ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', including his trademark feature, the [[Mad Fold-in|''Mad'' Fold-in]]. As of 2018, Jaffee remains a regular in the magazine after 63 years and is its longest-running contributor. In the half-century between April 1964 and April 2013, only one issue of ''Mad'' was published without containing new material by Jaffee.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Slaubaugh, [http://users.ipfw.edu/slaubau/madstreak.htm "''Mad'' Magazine Streaks"] Issues #1–506, Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[Wondercon]] Special Guests"; ''[[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]]'' magazine; Winter 2010; page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 interview, Jaffee said, "Serious people my age are dead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mechanic, Michael |url=http://motherjones.com/media/2010/09/interview-al-jaffee-mad-life-snappy-answers |title=Cartoonist Al Jaffee, the Original Mad Man |publisher=Mother Jones |date=September 24, 2010 |accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Jaffee was honored by the [[Reuben Awards]] as the Cartoonist of the Year. ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' cartoonist [[Arnold Roth]] said, "Al Jaffee is one of the great cartoonists of our time."&lt;ref name="Warner Books 1997"&gt;''Fold This Book!'', Warner Books, 1997, {{ISBN|0-446-91212-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing Jaffee, ''[[Peanuts]]'' creator [[Charles Schulz]] wrote, "Al can cartoon anything."

==Early life==
Jaffee was born March 13, 1921, in [[Savannah, Georgia]], to Mildred and Morris Jaffee, the oldest of four children, all sons.  His parents were both Jewish immigrants from [[Zarasai]], [[Lithuania]].  His father had a management job at a department store.
In 1927, Mildred Jaffee took her four sons, with Morris's acquiescence, to Zarasai.  After one year, Morris Jaffee showed up and took the family back to the United States.  After a year, Mildred took the four sons back to Lithuania.  After four more years, Morris showed up, and took the eldest three sons back to the United States.{{sfn|Weisman|2010|pp=23&amp;ndash;102}}  The youngest son would get out in 1940,{{sfn|Weisman|2010|p=140}} and Mildred presumably perished after the Nazi invasion.{{sfn|Weisman|2010|p=141}}&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;Cowan, Alison Leigh (October 1, 2010). [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/books/02jaffee.html?pagewanted=all "New Sketch of a Madcap’s Mad Life"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaffee studied at the [[The High School of Music &amp; Art|High School of Music &amp; Art]] in New York City in the late 1930s, along with his brother Harry and future ''Mad'' personnel [[Will Elder]], [[Harvey Kurtzman]], [[John Severin]] and [[Al Feldstein]].&lt;ref name="Mark Evanier 2002"&gt;Mark Evanier, ''Mad Art'', Watson-Guptill Publications, 2002, {{ISBN|0-8230-3080-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=neil /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fotosdecomics.blogspot.com/2009/08/mad.html Al Jaffee y Will Elder en 1939. Posando para la foto en la cafetería de su escuela del Brooklyn.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Jaffee began his career in 1941, working as a [[comic-book]] artist for several publications, including [[Timely Comics]] and [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1940s and 1950s precursors, respectively, of [[Marvel Comics]]. While working alongside future ''Mad'' cartoonist [[Dave Berg (cartoonist)|Dave Berg]], Jaffee created several humor features for Timely, including "Inferior Man" and "[[Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal]]".

During the war, he worked as an artist for the military in various capabilities.  His work included the original floor plan for the [[Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine]].  During this time, he took advantage of the military's free name change service, first to "Alvin Jaffe" by mistake, then to "Allan Jaffee".{{sfn|Weisman|2010|pp=152&amp;ndash;53}}  While working at the Pentagon, he met Ruth Ahlquist, whom he married in 1945.

In 1946, Jaffee returned to civilian life, working for Stan Lee again.  For approximately a year and a half in the late 1940s, Jaffee was editing Timely's humor and teenage comics, including the ''[[Patsy Walker]]'' line.

Jaffee recalled in a 2004 interview,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I created Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal from scratch. &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;editor-in-chief&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[Stan Lee|Stan &lt;nowiki&gt;[Lee]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] said to me, "Create an animated-type character. Something different, something new." I searched around and thought, "I've never seen anyone do anything about a seal," so I made him the lead character. So I created "Silly Seal". One day, Stan said to me, "Why don't you give him a little friend of some sort?" I had already created Ziggy Pig, who had his own little feature, so it was quite easy to combine them into one series. I said, "How about Ziggy Pig?" Stan said, "Okay!" I should add that, while I created Ziggy Pig, it was Stan who named him.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]'' #35 (April 2004): Al Jaffee interview.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 1957 to 1963, Jaffee drew the elongated ''Tall Tales'' panel for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', which was syndicated to over 100 newspapers.  Jaffee credited its middling success with a pantomime format that was easy to sell abroad, but his higher-ups were unsatisfied with the strip's status:  "The head of the syndicate, who was a certifiable idiot, said the reason it was not selling [better] is we gotta put words in it.  So they made me put words in it.  Immediately lost 28 foreign papers."&lt;ref name="The Comics Journal' 2000, pg. 43"&gt;''The Comics Journal'' #225, Fantagraphics Publications, July 2000, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of Jaffee's ''Tall Tales'' strips was published in 2008.   Jaffee also scripted the short-lived strips ''Debbie Deere'' and ''Jason'' in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lambiek.net/artists/j/jaffee_al.htm Al Jaffee] at the [[Lambiek Comiclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1984, Jaffee has provided illustrations for "The Shpy," a lighthearted [[Jewish]]-themed adventure feature in [[Tzivos Hashem]]'s bimonthly children's publication ''The Moshiach Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/04/a-mad-artist-works-undercover-for-the-messiah/ | work=The New York Times | title=Best Known for Mad, Also Read by Chabad Youngsters | date=October 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mad''===
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage = [[File:10.9.10AlJaffeeByLuigiNovi.jpg|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SGzZsBhpAk MAD Man, Retro Report Voices], 2:59, [[Retro Report]]&lt;ref name="retro1"&gt;{{cite web | title =MAD Man | work = | publisher =[[Retro Report]] | date = | url =https://www.retroreport.org/voices/mad-man/ | accessdate =December 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Jaffee first appeared in ''Mad'' in 1955, shortly after its transformation from comic book format to magazine.  When editor [[Harvey Kurtzman]] left in a dispute, Jaffee went with Kurtzman.  Jaffee contributed to Kurtzman's first two post-''Mad'' publishing efforts, ''[[Trump (magazine)|Trump]]'' and the creator-owned ''[[Humbug (magazine)|Humbug]]''. In 2008, the first full reprint of ''Humbug'' was published as a two-volume set by [[Fantagraphics]]; the set includes a newly commissioned cover illustration by Jaffee, and a co-interview with Jaffee and [[Arnold Roth]].

After ''Humbug'' folded in 1958, Jaffee brought his unpublished material to ''Mad'', which bought the work. "[[Bill Gaines]] took out every ''Trump'' and ''Humbug''," remembered Jaffee, "called me into his office, sat me down on the couch next to him, and went over every issue and said "Which is yours?"  And as he came to each one, when he saw my stuff, he OK'd to hire me."&lt;ref name="The Comics Journal' 2000, pg. 43"/&gt;

====The Fold-In====
In 1964, Jaffee created his longest-running ''Mad'' feature, the Fold-In. In each, a drawing is folded vertically and inward to reveal a new "hidden" picture (as well as a new caption).  Originally, Jaffee intended it as a one-shot "cheap" satire of the triple fold-outs that were appearing in glossy magazines such as ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''.  But Jaffee was asked to do a second installment, and soon the Fold-In became a recurring feature on the inside back cover of the magazine.  In 2011. Jaffee reflected, "The thing that I got a kick out of was&amp;nbsp;... ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' showed a Fold-In and the contestants all came up with the word they were looking for, which was "Fold-In."  So I realized, I created an English language word."

In 2010, Jaffee described the earliest Fold-Ins:
:I thought to myself&amp;nbsp;... now it's folded in and I've got to have something on the left side here, and something right side here. And the only thing that popped into my head was that [[Elizabeth Taylor]] had just dumped [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] and was carrying on with [[Richard Burton]]. So I had Elizabeth Taylor kissing Richard Burton, and a cop is holding the crowd back&amp;nbsp;– and just for the fun of it I put Eddie Fisher being trampled by the crowd. What a cruel thing to do! And then, when you fold it in, she's moving on from Richard Burton and kissing the next guy in the crowd. It's so simplistic and silly and juvenile! And anyone could have done that!
:I showed it to [[Al Feldstein]], and the first thing I said was, "Al, I've got this crazy idea, and you're not going to buy it, because it mutilates the magazine." So I put it in front of him, and the thing about Al was, he liked things that intrigued him. The mechanics of it intrigued him. He said, "You mean, you fold it, like this...? And then...?" He folded it, he unfolded it, he folded it, and then he said, "I like this!" But I said, "Al, it mutilates the magazine." And he said, "Well, I'll have to check it with [[William Gaines|Bill]]." He takes it, runs it to Bill's office, and he was there a little while, and he comes back and he says, "We're going to do it! You know what Bill said? Bill said, 'So they mutilate the magazine, and then they'll buy another one to save!'
:Four or five weeks later, Al comes over to me and says, "When are you going to do the next Fold-In?" And I said, "I don't have another Fold-In. That was it!" So he said, "Come on, you can come up with something else." I wracked my brain, and the only thing I could come up with was Nixon [whose face was hidden within curtain folds]. That one really set the tone for what the cleverness of the Fold-Ins has to be. It couldn't just be bringing someone from the left to kiss someone on the right."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thephoenix.com/Boston/arts/111658-interview-al-jaffee/ ''The Boston Phoenix]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fold-In has since become one of ''Mad'''s signature features, and has appeared in almost every issue of the magazine from 1964–2017.&lt;ref name=neil&gt;Genzlinger, Neil. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/arts/design/30genz.html "A Veteran Mad Man Remains in the Fold]," ''New York Times'', "Arts and Leisure," 1, 25, (March 30, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; A single issue in 1977 was published without a Fold-In (though Jaffee supplied the issue's back cover), and a 1980 issue instead featured a unique double-visual gimmick by Jaffee in which the inside back cover and the outside back cover merged to create a third image when held up to the light.  The third-ever Fold-In in 1964 featured a unique diagonal folding design, rather than the standard left-right vertical format.  The image revealed the four members of [[The Beatles]] becoming bald (and thus losing their popularity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madcoversite.com/quiz_beatlefold.html |title=Fold-In Detail of ''Mad'' #88, by Doug Gilford |publisher=Madcoversite.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Far Side]]'' creator [[Gary Larson]] described his experience with the Fold-In:  "The dilemma was always this: Very slowly and carefully fold the back cover&amp;nbsp;... ''without'' creasing the page and quickly look at the joke.  Jaffee's artistry ''before'' the folding was so amazing that I suspect I was not alone in not wanting to deface it in any way."&lt;ref name="Warner Books 1997" /&gt; In 1972, Jaffee received a [[Reuben Awards#The Reuben Awards|Special Features Reuben Award]] for his Fold-Ins.

Jaffee uses a computer only for typographic maneuvers to make certain Fold-In tricks easier to design and he typically takes two weeks to sketch and finalize an image.&lt;ref name="guardian2016"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/09/95-year-old-mad-cartoonist-al-jaffee-the-world-is-full-of-bloviators |title= 95-year-old ''Mad'' Cartoonist Al Jaffee: 'The World Is Full of Bloviators' |last=Thielman |first=Sam |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=November 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, all his work is done by hand. "I'm working on a hard, flat board...  I cannot fold it. That's why my planning has to be so correct." In 2008, Jaffee told one newspaper, "I never see the finished painting folded until it's printed in the magazine. I guess I have that kind of visual mind where I can see the two sides without actually putting them together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Black |url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080628/LIFE/806280303 |title=The Mad World of Al Jaffee |publisher=CapeCodOnline.com |date=June 28, 2008 |accessdate=2009-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702000445/http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080628%2FLIFE%2F806280303 |archivedate=July 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrasting current art techniques and Jaffee's approach, ''Mad'''s art director, [[Sam Viviano]], said, "I think part of the brilliance of the Fold-In is lost on the younger generations who are so used to [[Photoshop]] and being able to do stuff like that on a computer."&lt;ref name=neil /&gt;

===In the 2000s===
As of 2018, Jaffee continues to do the Fold-In for ''Mad'', as well as additional artwork for articles. ''Mad'''s oldest regular contributor, Jaffee's work has appeared in 500 of the magazine's first 550 issues, a total unmatched by any other writer or artist. He has said, "I work for a magazine that's essentially for young people, and to have them keep me going, I feel very lucky&amp;nbsp;... To use an old cliché, I'm like an old racehorse. When the other horses are running, I want to run too."&lt;ref name=neil /&gt;

In August 2008, Jaffee was interviewed for an [[NY1]] feature about his career. He said, "It astonishes me that I still am functioning at a fairly decent level. Because there were a lot of dark days, but you have to reinvent yourself. You get knocked down and you pick up yourself and you move on."&lt;ref name="ny1.com"/&gt;

A four-volume hardcover boxed set, ''The Mad Fold-In Collection: 1964–2010'', was published by Chronicle Books in September 2011, {{ISBN|978-0811872850}}.

===Frequent themes===
[[File:Al Jaffee 2008.png|thumb|left|Jaffee signing in 2008]]
Will Forbis wrote: "This is the core of Jaffee's work: the idea that to be alive is to be constantly beleaguered by annoying idiots, poorly designed products and the unapologetic ferocity of fate. Competence and intelligence are not rewarded in life but punished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbisthemighty.com/acidlogic/im_al_jaffee.htm |title=Al Jaffee – Interesting Motherfuckers – Acid Logic ezine |publisher=Forbisthemighty.com |date=March 30, 2008 |accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book ''Inside Mad'', fellow ''Mad'' writer [[Desmond Devlin]] called Jaffee "the irreplaceable embodiment of ''Mad Magazine's'' range: smart but silly, angry but understanding, sophisticated but gross, upbeat but hopeless.  ...He's uncommonly interested in figuring out how things work, and exasperated because things NEVER work."&lt;ref&gt;''Inside Mad'', Time Home Entertainment Inc., 2013, pg. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaffee has contributed to hundreds of ''Mad'' articles as either a writer or an artist and often both. These include his long-running "Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions", which present multiple putdowns for the same unnecessary or clueless inquiry, and several articles on [[invention]]s and gadgets, which are presented in an elaborately detailed "blueprint" style. Sergio Aragones says of Jaffee, "He is brilliant at many things, but especially inventions.  When he draws a machine for ''Mad'', no matter how silly the idea, it always looks like it works.  He thinks that way because he is not only an artist, but a technician as well... He is the guy who can do anything."&lt;ref name="Mark Evanier 2002" /&gt; In a patent file for a self-extinguishing cigarette, the inventor thanked Jaffee for providing the inspiration.&lt;ref name="The Comics Journal' 2000, pg. 43"/&gt; Other actual inventions that have since come to pass had appeared earlier in Jaffee articles, such as telephone redial and address books (1961), snowboarding (1965), the computer spell-checker (1967), peelable stamps, multi-blade razors (1979), and graffiti-proof building surfaces (1982).  "I could imagine those things," Jaffee told an interviewer.  "That was the fun part.  But I never had the problem of trying to figure out how to manufacture them."&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Mike, ''And Here's the Kicker'', Writer's Digest Books, 2009, pgs. 224–225&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Vietnam War]], Jaffee also created the short-lived gag cartoon ''Hawks and Doves'', in which a military officer named Major Hawks is antagonized by Private Doves, an easygoing soldier who contrives to create surreptitious [[peace sign]]s in various locations on a military base. In a 1998 issue, all the ''Hawks &amp; Doves'' strips were republished, along with an original strip in color on the back of the issue.

Some of Jaffee's features were expanded into stand-alone books, including a 1997 collection of Fold-Ins titled ''Fold This Book!'' {{ISBN|978-0446912129}} and eight "Snappy Answers" paperbacks. Referring to the latter, Jaffee said, "I was going through a divorce when I started that. I got a lot of my hostility out through Snappy Answers."&lt;ref name="Mark Evanier 2002"/&gt;

==Techniques and materials==
When designing his ''Mad'' Fold-Ins, Jaffee starts with the finished "answer" to the Fold-In, and then spreads it apart and places a piece of tracing paper over it in order to fill in the center "throw-away" aspect of the image, which is covered up when the page is folded over, using regular pencil at this stage. Jaffee will then trace the image onto another piece of [[illustration board]] using [[carbon paper]]. At this stage he uses red or green color pencils, which are distinct from the black pencil of the original drawing, in order to discern his progress. Once the image is on the illustration board, he will then finish it by painting it. Because the illustration board is too inflexible to fold, Jaffee does not see the finished Fold-In image until it is published.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Erik (September 28, 2010).

Jaffee won the [[National Cartoonists Society]] Advertising and Illustration Award for 1973, its Special Features Award for 1971 and 1975, and its Humor Comic Book Award for 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuben.org/ncs-awards/division-awards/#comic |title=Division Awards Comic Books |year=2013 |publisher=[[National Cartoonists Society]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LtzEHxaD?url=http://www.reuben.org/ncs-awards/division-awards/ |archivedate=December 16, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=December 16, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he won the [[Reuben Awards]]' Cartoonist of the Year.&lt;ref name="E&amp;P"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/departments/syndicates/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003808284|title='Mad' Magazine Legend and Newspaper Cartoonists Among NCS Winners|last=Astor|first=Dave|date=May 27, 2008|work=Editor &amp; Publisher|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the production company Motion Theory created a video for recording artist [[Beck]]'s song "Girl" using Jaffee's ''Mad'' Fold-Ins as inspiration; Jaffee's name appears briefly in the video, on a television screen.&lt;ref&gt;"Girl" (Beck music video), via [http://www.sparehed.com/2008/04/24/beck-in-a-jaffee-way/Beck "Back in a Jaffee Way"]. ''The Ephemerist''. August 24, 2008. Retrieved October 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The March 13, 2006, episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' aired on Jaffee's 85th birthday, and comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] saluted the artist with a Fold-In [[birthday cake]]. The cake featured the salutary message "Al, you have repeatedly shown artistry &amp; care of great credit to your field." When the center section of the cake was removed, the remainder read, "Al, you are old."&lt;ref name=neil /&gt;

That was not Jaffee's first interaction with the comedian. In 2010, he recalled:
:I got a call from ''[[The Daily Show]]''&amp;nbsp;– they asked me if I would contribute a Fold-In to their book, ''[[America (The Book)|America]]''. I said I'd be happy to do it. When I was done, I called up the producer who'd contacted me, and I said, "I've finished the Fold-In, where shall I send it?" And he said&amp;nbsp;– and this was a great compliment&amp;nbsp;– "Oh, please Mr. Jaffee, could you deliver it in person? The whole crew wants to meet you." And that's where I met Stephen Colbert and [[Jon Stewart]] and all the writers, and they told me it was our work in ''Mad'' that inspired them. Not me, particularly, but us, generally... They said, "Without you guys, we wouldn't be here." And I felt really good about that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mazur, Dan |url=http://thephoenix.com/Boston/arts/111658-interview-al-jaffee/?page=3#TOPCONTENT |title=Interview: Al Jaffee [unabridged&amp;#93; |publisher=The Phoenix |date=November 18, 2010 |accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, during the [[San Diego Comic-Con]], Jaffee was one of six inductees into the [[Will Eisner Hall of Fame]]. Jaffee, who worked for Eisner in his studio for one of his earliest jobs, was not present during the convention, and the award was accepted by ''Mad'' Art Director [[Sam Viviano]], who presented it to Jaffee at a later date. The other inductees were [[Lee Falk]], [[Mort Meskin]], [[Spain Rodriguez]], [[Joe Sinnott]], and [[Trina Robbins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comic-con.org/awards/eisners-current-info "Eisner Awards Current Info"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6O28VVwgM?url=http://www.comic-con.org/awards/eisners-current-info |date=March 13, 2014 }}.

On March 30, 2016, it was officially declared that Jaffee had "the longest career as a comics artist" at "73 years, 3 months" by ''[[Guinness World Records]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.de/world-records/419611-longest-career-as-a-comics-artist&lt;/ref&gt; ''Guinness'' noted that he had worked continuously, beginning with Jaffee's contribution to the December 1942 issue of ''Joker Comics'' and continuing through the April 2016 issue of ''Mad'' Magazine.
