He also directed the film version of ''[[The Spirit (film)|The Spirit]]'', shared directing duties with [[Robert Rodriguez]] on ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' and ''[[Sin City: A Dame to Kill For]]'', and produced the film ''[[300 (film)|300]]''.  His film ''Sin City'' earned a [[Palme d'Or]] nomination, and he has received every major comic book industry award. In 2015, Miller was inducted into the [[Will Eisner Award]] Hall of Fame.

He created the comic book characters [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] for [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' series, and a female version of the [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] character, [[Carrie Kelley]], for [[DC Comics]].

Miller is noted for combining film noir and manga influences in his comic art creations. "I realized when I started ''Sin City'' that I found American and English comics be too wordy, too constipated, and Japanese comics to be too empty. So I was attempting to do a hybrid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/21241/1/frank-miller-comics-to-kill-for|title= Frank Miller: Comic Yo Kill For|first= John|last= Dunning|date= n.d.|work= [[Dazed]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160510134629/http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/21241/1/frank-miller-comics-to-kill-for|archivedate= May 10, 2016|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Miller grew up a comics fan; a letter he wrote to [[Marvel Comics]] was published in ''[[Tigra|The Cat]]'' #3 (April 1973).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/26128/ ''The Cat'' #3] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt; His first published work was at [[Western Publishing]]'s [[Gold Key Comics]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], received at the recommendation of comics artist [[Neal Adams]], to whom a fledgling Miller, after moving to New York City, had shown samples and received much critique and occasional informal lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://frankmillerink.com/2010/7/neal-adams|title= Neal Adams|first= Frank|last= Miller|date= July 21, 2010|publisher= FrankMillerInk.com (official site) |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100803002053/http://frankmillerink.com/2010/7/neal-adams|archivedate= August 3, 2010|deadurl= yes|accessdate= March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though no published credits appear, he is tentatively credited with the three-page story "Royal Feast" in the licensed TV series comic book ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' #84 (June 1978), by an unknown writer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/32321/#199327 "Royal Feast", ''The Twilight Zone'' #84 (June 1978)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].&lt;/ref&gt; and is credited with the five-page "Endless Cloud", also by an unknown writer, in the following issue (July 1978).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/32410/#199635  "Endless Cloud",  ''The Twilight Zone'' #85 (July 1978)] at the Grand Comics Database.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the latter, Miller had his first confirmed credit in writer Wyatt Gwyon's six-page "Deliver Me From D-Day", inked by Danny Bulanadi, in ''[[Weird War Tales]]'' #64 (June 1978).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/32316/#199299 "Deliver Me From D-Day", ''Weird War Tales'' #64 (June 1978)] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Marvel editor-in-chief [[Jim Shooter]] recalled Miller going to [[DC Comics]] after having broken in with "...a small job from [[Western Publishing]], I think. Thus emboldened, he went to DC, and after getting savaged by [[Joe Orlando]], got in to see art director [[Vince Colletta|Vinnie Colletta]], who recognized talent and arranged for him to get a one-page war-comic job".&lt;ref name=jimshooterinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manwithoutfear.com/interviews/ddINTERVIEW.shtml?id=Shooter |title=Interview with Jim Shooter |first=Kuljit |last=Mithra |publisher=ManWithoutFear.com |date=July 1998 |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118200906/http://manwithoutfear.com/interviews/ddINTERVIEW.shtml?id=Shooter |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Grand Comics Database]] does not list this job; there may have been a one-page DC story, or Shooter may have misremembered the page count or have been referring to the two-page story, by writer [[Roger McKenzie (comics)|Roger McKenzie]], "Slowly, painfully, you dig your way from the cold, choking debris..." in ''[[Weird War Tales]]'' #68 (Oct. 1978).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/32672/#200551 ''Weird War Tales'' #68 (Oct. 1978)] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt; Other fledgling work at DC included the six-page "The Greatest Story Never Told", by writer [[Paul Kupperberg]], in that same issue, and the five-page "The Edge of History", written by [[Elliot S. Maggin]], in ''[[Unknown Soldier (DC Comics)|Unknown Soldier]]'' #219 (Sept. 1978). His first work for Marvel Comics was penciling the 17-page story "The Master Assassin of Mars, Part 3" in ''[[John Carter, Warlord of Mars]]'' #18 (Nov. 1978).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/search/advanced/process/?target=sequence&amp;method=icontains&amp;logic=True&amp;order1=date&amp;order2=series&amp;order3=&amp;title=&amp;feature=&amp;job_number=&amp;pages=&amp;script=Frank+Miller&amp;pencils=Frank+Miller&amp;inks=Frank+Miller&amp;colors=Frank+Miller&amp;letters=Frank+Miller&amp;story_editing=Frank+Miller&amp;genre=&amp;characters=&amp;synopsis=&amp;reprint_notes=&amp;notes=&amp;start_date=1976&amp;end_date=&amp;pub_name=&amp;pub_notes=&amp;series=&amp;series_notes=&amp;tracking_notes=&amp;publication_notes=&amp;language=en&amp;issues=&amp;volume=&amp;issue_date=&amp;brand=&amp;indicia_publisher=&amp;price=&amp;issue_pages=&amp;format=&amp;issue_editing=Frank+Miller&amp;issue_notes=&amp;is_indexed=None Frank Miller] at the Grand Comics Database. NOTE: A different artist named [[Frank Miller (newspaper cartoonist)|Frank Miller]] was active in the 1940s. He died December 3, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Marvel, Miller would settle in as a regular fill-in and cover artist, working on a variety of titles. One of these jobs was drawing ''Peter Parker, [[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #27–28 (Feb.–March 1979), which guest-starred [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saffel|first=Steve|title= Spider-Man the Icon: The Life and Times of a Pop Culture Phenomenon|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|year=2007|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-1-84576-324-4|chapter=A Not-So-Spectacular Experiment|page= 73|quote= Frank Miller was the guest penciler for ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #27, February 1979, written by Bill Mantlo. [The issue's] splash page was the first time Miller's [rendition of] Daredevil appeared in a Marvel story.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, sales of the ''Daredevil'' title were poor but Miller saw potential in "a blind protagonist in a purely visual medium," he recalled in 2000.&lt;ref name="goodreads2004"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4283754-daredevil-by-frank-miller-klaus-janson-vol-1|title= ''Daredevil by Frank Miller &amp; Klaus Janson, Vol. 1''|date= n.d.|publisher= [[Goodreads]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160412045955/https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4283754-daredevil-by-frank-miller-klaus-janson-vol-1|archivedate= April 12, 2016|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller went to writer and staffer [[Jo Duffy]] (a mentor-figure whom he called his "guardian angel" at Marvel)&lt;ref name="goodreads2004" /&gt; and she passed on his interest to editor-in-chief [[Jim Shooter]] to get Miller work on Daredevil's regular title. Shooter agreed and made Miller the new penciller on the title. As Miller recalled in 2008:

{{quote|text=When I first showed up in New York, I showed up with a bunch of comics, a bunch of samples, of guys in trench coats and old cars and such. And [comics editors] said, 'Where are the guys in tights?' And I had to learn how to do it. But as soon as a title came along, when [''Daredevil'' signature artist] [[Gene Colan]] left ''Daredevil'', I realized it was my secret in to do crime comics with a superhero in them. And so I lobbied for the title and got it.&lt;ref name=fji /&gt;}}

''Daredevil'' #158 (May 1979), Miller's debut on that title,  was the finale of an ongoing story written by [[Roger McKenzie (comics)|Roger McKenzie]] and [[inker|inked]] by [[Klaus Janson]]. After this issue, Miller became one of Marvel's rising stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 189|isbn =978-0-7566-4123-8|quote= In this issue the great longtime ''Daredevil'' artist Gene Colan was succeeded by a new penciller who would become a star himself: Frank Miller.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, sales on ''Daredevil'' did not improve, Marvel's management continued to discuss cancellation, and Miller himself almost quit the series, as he disliked McKenzie's scripts.&lt;ref name=jimshooterinterview /&gt; Miller's fortunes changed with the arrival of [[Denny O'Neil]] as editor. Realizing Miller's unhappiness with the series, and impressed by a backup story he had written, O'Neil moved McKenzie to another project so that Miller could try writing the series himself.&lt;ref name=jimshooterinterview /&gt;&lt;ref name="O'NeilInt"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/ONeil | title = Interview with Dennis O'Neil|first= Kuljit|last= Mithra|date= February 1998 | publisher =  ManWithoutFear.com |accessdate= May 10, 2013 | archivedate= March 21, 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130321185605/http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/ONeil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller and O'Neil would maintain a friendly working relationship throughout his run on the series.&lt;ref name="DAK2"&gt;{{cite news | author = Kraft, David Anthony | author2 = Salicup, Jim | authorlink = David Anthony Kraft | authorlink2 = Jim Salicrup | date = April 1983 | title = Frank Miller's Ronin | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 2 | pages = 7–21 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With issue #168 (Jan. 1981), Miller took over full duties as writer and penciller. Sales rose so swiftly that Marvel once again began publishing ''Daredevil'' monthly rather than bimonthly just three issues after Miller became its writer.

Issue #168 saw the first full appearance of the [[ninja]] [[mercenary]] [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]—who would become a popular character and star in a 2005 motion picture—although her first cover appearance was four months earlier on Miller's cover of ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #58.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 201: "Matt Murdock's college sweetheart first appeared in this issue [#168] by writer/artist Frank Miller."&lt;/ref&gt; Miller later wrote and drew a solo Elektra story in ''Bizarre Adventures'' #28 (Oct. 1981). He added a [[martial arts]] aspect to Daredevil's fighting skills,&lt;ref name="DAK2" /&gt; and introduced previously unseen characters who had played a major part in the character's youth: [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], leader of the ninja clan the [[Chaste (Marvel Comics)|Chaste]], who had been Murdock's [[sensei]] after he was blinded&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 202: "Possibly modeled after Nantembo, a Zen master who reputedly disciplined his students by striking them with his nantin staff, Stick first appeared in this issue [#176] by Frank Miller."&lt;/ref&gt; and a rival clan called the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]].&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 202: The Hand was a league of ninja assassins who employed dark magic...Introduced in ''Daredevil'' #174 by writer/artist Frank Miller, this group of deadly warriors had been hired by the Kingpin of Crime to exterminate Matt Murdock."&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to handle both writing and penciling ''Daredevil'' on the new monthly schedule, Miller began increasingly relying on Janson for the artwork, sending him looser and looser pencils beginning with #173.&lt;ref name="Back21"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Cordier|first=Philippe|title=Seeing Red: Dissecting Daredevil's Defining Years|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=21|pages=33–60|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= April 2007|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; By issue #185, Miller had virtually relinquished his role as Daredevil's artist, and was providing only rough layouts for Janson to both pencil and ink, allowing him to focus on the writing.&lt;ref name="Back21"/&gt;

Miller's work on Daredevil was characterized by darker themes and stories. This peaked when in #181 (April 1982) he had the [[assassination|assassin]] [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] kill Elektra,&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 207: "Frank Miller did the unthinkable when he killed off the popular Elektra in ''Daredevil'' #181."&lt;/ref&gt; and Daredevil subsequently attempt to kill him. Miller finished his ''Daredevil'' run with issue #191 (Feb. 1983), which he cited in a winter 1983 interview as the issue he is most proud of;&lt;ref name="DAK2"/&gt; by this time he had transformed a second-tier character into one of Marvel's most popular.

Additionally, Miller drew a short [[Batman]] Christmas story, "Wanted: Santa Claus – Dead or Alive", written by [[Dennis O'Neil]] for ''[[DC Special Series]]'' #21 (Spring 1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dougall|first2=Alastair, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title= Batman: A Visual History|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2014|location= London, United Kingdom|page= 136|isbn= 978-1-4654-2456-3|quote= One of the most important creators ever to work on Batman, writer/artist Frank Miller drew his first Batman story in this issue. While it featured five self-contained tales, the story 'Wanted: Santa Claus – Dead or Alive', written by Denny O'Neil and penciled by Miller was the standout.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was his first professional experience with a character with which, like Daredevil, he would become closely associated. At Marvel, O'Neil and Miller collaborated on two issues of ''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual''. The 1980 Annual featured a team-up with [[Doctor Strange]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2012|location= London, United Kingdom|page= 114|isbn = 978-0-7566-9236-0|quote= Writer Denny O'Neil and artist Frank Miller...used their considerable talents in this rare collaboration that teamed two other legends – Dr. Strange and Spider-Man.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the 1981 Annual showcased a meeting with the [[Punisher]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Gilbert (2012), p. 120: "Writer Denny O'Neil teamed with artist Frank Miller to concoct a Spider-Man annual that played to both their strengths. Miller and O'Neil seemed to flourish in the gritty world of street crime so tackling a Spider/Punisher fight was a natural choice."&lt;/ref&gt;

As penciler and co-plotter, Miller, together with writer [[Chris Claremont]], produced the [[miniseries]] ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' #1–4 (Sept.-Dec. 1982),&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 208: "The most popular member of the X-Men was finally featured in his first solo title, a four-issue limited series by writer Chris Claremont and writer/artist Frank Miller."&lt;/ref&gt; inked by [[Josef Rubinstein]] and spinning off from the popular ''[[X-Men]]'' title.

His first [[creator ownership|creator-owned]] title was DC Comics' six-issue miniseries ''[[Ronin (DC Comics)|Ronin]]'' (1983–1984). In 1985, DC Comics named Miller as one of the honorees in the company's 50th-anniversary publication ''[[Fifty Who Made DC Great]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = Marx, Barry| cowriters = [[Joey Cavalieri|Cavalieri, Joey]] and Hill, Thomas| artist = Petruccio, Steven | editor = Marx, Barry| story = Frank Miller Experiment in Creative Autonomy| title = Fifty Who Made DC Great| date = 1985| publisher = DC Comics|page = 50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller was involved in a few [[List of comics solicited but never published|unpublished projects]] in the early 1980s. A house advertisement for ''[[Doctor Strange]]'' appeared in Marvel Comics cover-dated February 1981. It stated "Watch for the new adventures of Earth's Sorcerer Supreme – - as mystically conjured by Roger Stern and Frank Miller!". Miller's only contribution to the series would be the cover for ''Doctor Strange'' #46 (April 1981). Other commitments prevented him from working on the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/04/12/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-98|title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #98|first=Brian|last=Cronin|date=April 12, 2007|publisher=Comic Book Resources|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HsBvfkkL?url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/04/12/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-98|archivedate=July 5, 2013|deadurl=no|accessdate=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller and [[Steve Gerber]] made a proposal to revamp DC's three biggest characters: [[Superman]], Batman, and [[Wonder Woman]], under a line called "Metropolis" and comics titled "Man of Steel" or "The Man of Steel", "Dark Knight" and "Amazon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/04/01/comic-book-legends-revealed-254|title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #254|author=Cronin, Brian|date=April 1, 2010|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=November 6, 2011|archivedate=November 13, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63A6fwhjK?url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/04/01/comic-book-legends-revealed-254|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this proposal was not accepted.

===''Batman: The Dark Knight Returns'' and the late 1980s===
In 1986, DC Comics released the writer-penciler Miller's ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'', a four-issue [[miniseries]] printed in what the publisher called "prestige format"—squarebound, rather than stapled; on heavy-stock paper rather than newsprint, and with cardstock rather than glossy-paper covers. It was [[inker|inked]] by [[Klaus Janson]] and [[colorist|colored]] by [[Lynn Varley]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The story tells how [[Batman]] retired after the death of the second [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (Jason Todd), and at age 55 returns to fight crime in a dark and violent future. Miller created a tough, gritty Batman, referring to  him as "The Dark Knight" based upon his being called the "Darknight Detective" in some 1970s portrayals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Fleisher|first= Michael|authorlink=Michael Fleisher|title= The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes Volume 1 Batman|publisher= [[Collier Books]]|date=1976|location= New York, New York|page= 31|isbn= 978-0-02-080090-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[Dark Knight (nickname)|nickname "Dark Knight"]] for Batman dates back to 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nobleman|first=Marc Tyler|year=2012|title=Bill the Boy Wonder: The Secret Co-Creator of Batman|publisher=Charlesbridge Publishing|page=Back Matter|isbn=978-1-58089-289-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The term appears on page seven of the story "The Joker" from ''Batman'' No. 1 (1940), which is reprinted in the book ''Batman Chronicles, Volume One'' (2005). In the lower right panel, Batman is shown swimming in the water after having been knocked off a bridge by the Joker, and the caption reads "THE SHOCK OF COLD WATER QUICKLY REVIVES THE DARK KNIGHT!"&lt;/ref&gt; Released the same year as [[Alan Moore]]'s and [[Dave Gibbons]]' DC miniseries ''[[Watchmen]]'', it showcased a new form of more adult-oriented storytelling to both comics fans and a crossover [[mainstream audience]]. ''The Dark Knight Returns'' influenced the comic-book industry by heralding a new wave of darker characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter=1980s|title=DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-7566-6742-9|page=219|quote=It is arguably the best Batman story of all time.

By this time, Miller had returned as the writer of ''Daredevil''. Following his self-contained story "Badlands", penciled by [[John Buscema]], in #219 (June 1985), he co-wrote #226 (Jan. 1986) with departing writer [[Dennis O'Neil]]. Then, with artist [[David Mazzucchelli]], he crafted a seven-issue story arc that, like ''The Dark Knight Returns'', similarly redefined and reinvigorated its main character. The storyline, "[[Born Again (comics)|Daredevil: Born Again]]", in #227–233 (Feb.-Aug. 1986)&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 226: "'Born Again' was a seven-issue story arc that appeared in ''Daredevil'' from issue #227 to #233 (Feb.–Aug. 1986) by writer Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli."&lt;/ref&gt; chronicled the hero's Catholic background, and the destruction and rebirth of his real-life identity, [[Manhattan]] attorney Matt Murdock, at the hands of Daredevil's nemesis, the crime lord Wilson Fisk, also known as the  [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. After completing the "Born Again" arc, Frank Miller intended to produce a two-part story with artist [[Walt Simonson]] but it was never completed and remains unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/Simonson|title=Interview With Walt Simonson|first=Kuljit|last=Mithra|date=1997|publisher=ManWithoutFear.com|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FCDQhp6w?url=http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/Simonson|archivedate=March 17, 2013|deadurl=no|accessdate=March 17, 2013|quote=The gist of it is that by the time Marvel was interested in having us work on the story, Frank was off doing ''Dark Knight'' and I was off doing ''X-Factor''. So it never happened. Too bad—it was a cool story too.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller and artist [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] produced the [[graphic novel]] ''Daredevil: Love and War'' in 1986. Featuring the character of the Kingpin, it indirectly bridges Miller's first run on ''Daredevil'' and ''Born Again'' by explaining the change in the Kingpin's attitude toward Daredevil.  Miller and Sienkiewicz also produced the eight-issue miniseries ''[[Elektra: Assassin]]''  for [[Epic Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 228: "Produced by Frank Miller and illustrated by Bill Sienkiewicz, ''Elektra: Assassin'' was an eight-issue limited series. Because its mature content was inappropriate for children, it was published by Marvel's Epic Comics imprint."&lt;/ref&gt; Set outside regular Marvel continuity, it featured a wild tale of [[cyborg]]s and [[ninja]]s, while expanding further on Elektra's background. Both of these projects were critically well received. ''Elektra: Assassin'' was praised for its bold storytelling, but neither it nor ''Daredevil: Love and War'' had the influence or reached as many readers as ''Dark Knight Returns'' or ''Born Again''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Miller's final major story in this period was in ''Batman'' issues 404–407 in 1987, another collaboration with Mazzucchelli. Titled ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', this was Miller's version of the origin of Batman in which he [[retconned]] many details and adapted the story to fit his ''Dark Knight'' [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]. Proving to be hugely popular,&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 227 "Melding Miller's noir sensibilities, realistic characterization, and gritty action with Mazzucchelli's brilliant iconic imagery, "Year One" thrilled readers and critics alike...as well as being one of the influences for the 2005 film ''Batman Begins''.&lt;/ref&gt; this was as influential as Miller's previous work and a trade paperback released in 1988 remains in print and is one of DC's best selling books and adapted as an [[Batman: Year One (film)|original animated film video]] in 2011.

Miller had also drawn the covers for the first twelve issues of [[First Comics]] English language reprints of [[Kazuo Koike]] and [[Goseki Kojima]]'s ''[[Lone Wolf and Cub]]''. This helped bring Japanese manga to a wider Western audience.

During this time, Miller (along with [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Alan Moore]] and [[Howard Chaykin]]) had been in dispute with DC Comics over a proposed ratings system for comics. Disagreeing with what he saw as censorship, Miller refused to do any further work for DC,&lt;ref name="ICv2" /&gt; and he would take his future projects to the independent publisher [[Dark Horse Comics]]. From then on Miller would be a major supporter of creator rights and be a major voice against censorship in comics.

=== The 1990s: ''Sin City'' and ''300'' ===
After announcing he intended to release his work only via the independent publisher [[Dark Horse Comics]], Miller completed one final project for [[Epic Comics]], the mature-audience imprint of Marvel Comics. ''[[Elektra Lives Again]]'' was a fully painted [[graphic novel]] written and drawn by Miller and colored by longtime partner [[Lynn Varley]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Matthew K. "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 253: "Frank Miller made his triumphant return to Elektra, the character he breathed life into and then subsequently snuffed out, with the graphic novel ''Elektra Lives Again''."&lt;/ref&gt; Telling the story of the [[resurrection]] of Elektra from the dead and Daredevil's quest to find her, as well as showing Miller's will to experiment with new story-telling techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nycgraphicnovelists.com/2010/12/frank-miller-part-1-dames-dark-knights.html|title= Frank Miller Part 1: Dames, Dark Knights, Devils, and Heroes |last= Irving|first= Christopher|date= December 1, 2010|publisher= NYCGraphicNovelists.com |accessdate= November 25, 2011|archivedate= July 1, 2012| deadurl= no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120701074451/http://www.nycgraphicnovelists.com/2010/12/frank-miller-part-1-dames-dark-knights.html|quote= Miller works Matt’s narrating captions between the present, the past, and his dream imagery of Elektra, a fragmentation given a voiceover straight out of an old crime book, but with a heavy dose of sensitivity that never veers into the maudlin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1990 saw Miller and artist [[Geof Darrow]] start work on ''[[Hard Boiled (comic)|Hard Boiled]]'', a three-issue miniseries. The title, a mix of violence and satire, was praised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/09/17/comics-you-should-own-hard-boiled|title=Comics You Should Own – ''Hard Boiled''|last1=Burgas|first1=Greg|date=September 17, 2008|publisher=Comic Book Resources|quote=[W]e can see that Miller and Darrow were creating a marvelous satire, one that pulls no punches and lets none of us off the hook, which is what the best satire does.

At the same time Miller and artist [[Dave Gibbons]] produced ''[[Give Me Liberty]]'', a four-issue miniseries for Dark Horse. ''Give Me Liberty'' was followed by sequel miniseries and specials expanding on the story of protagonist [[Martha Washington (comics)|Martha Washington]], an African-American woman in modern and near-future southern North America, all of which were written by Miller and drawn by Gibbons.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Miller also wrote the scripts for the science fiction films ''[[RoboCop 2]]'' and ''[[RoboCop 3]]'', about a police [[cyborg]]. Neither was critically well received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE7D71139F931A15755C0A966958260|title= Robocop 2 (1990) Review/Film; New Challenge and Enemy For a Cybernetic Organism|last1=Maslin|first1=Janet|date=June 22, 1990|work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19931105/REVIEWS/311050305/1023|title= ''RoboCop 3''|last1= Ebert|first1= Roger|authorlink1= Roger Ebert|date= November 5, 1993|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Miller stated that "There was a lot of interference in the writing process. It wasn't ideal. After working on the two Robocop movies, I really thought that was it for me in the business of film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.contactmusic.com/news/miller-robocop-movies-almost-put-me-off-hollywood_1034760|title= Miller: 'Robocop Movies Almost Put Me Off Hollywood'|last1= |first1= |date= June 20, 2007|publisher= [[Contactmusic.com]]|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller would come into contact with the fictional cyborg once more, writing the comic-book miniseries, ''[[RoboCop Versus The Terminator (comics)|RoboCop Versus The Terminator]]'', with art by [[Walter Simonson]]. In 2003, Miller's screenplay for ''RoboCop 2'' was adapted by [[Steven Grant]] for [[Avatar Press]]'s Pulsaar imprint. Illustrated by [[Juan Jose Ryp]], the series is called ''[[Frank Miller's RoboCop]]'' and contains plot elements that were divided between ''RoboCop 2'' and ''RoboCop 3''.

In 1991, Miller started work on his first ''[[Sin City]]'' story. Serialized in ''[[Dark Horse Presents]]'' #51–62, it proved to be another success, and the story was released in a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]. This first Sin City "yarn" was rereleased in 1995 under the name ''[[The Hard Goodbye]]''. ''Sin City'' proved to be Miller's main project for much of the remainder of the decade, as Miller told [[List of Sin City yarns|more Sin City stories]] within this noir world of his creation, in the process helping to revitalize the [[crime comics]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindenmuth|first=Brian|title=The Fall (and Rise) of the Crime Comic|publisher=[[Hachette Book Group USA|Mulholland Books]]| date=December 14, 2010|url=http://www.mulhollandbooks.com/2010/12/14/a-history-of-and-appreciation-for-crime-comics|quote=As much as ''100 Bullets'' is a cornerstone of the modern crime comic, it did not spring fully formed into the world.

Miller lived in Los Angeles, California in the 1990s, which influenced ''[[Sin City]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

''[[Daredevil: The Man Without Fear]]'' was a five issue miniseries published by Marvel Comics in 1993. In this story, Miller and artist [[John Romita Jr.]] told Daredevil's origins differently from in the previous comics, and provided additional detail to his beginnings.&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 264: "Comic legends Frank Miller and John Romita, Jr. united to tell a new version of Daredevil's origin in this carefully crafted five-issue miniseries."&lt;/ref&gt; Miller also returned to superheroes by writing issue #11 of [[Todd McFarlane]]'s ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', as well as the ''[[Spawn/Batman]]'' crossover for [[Image Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 267: "This prestige one-shot marked Frank Miller's return to Batman, and was labeled as a companion piece to his classic 1986 work ''Batman: The Dark Knight Returns''.  The issue was drawn by Todd McFarlane, one of the most popular artists in comic book history."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Miller and Darrow collaborated again on ''[[Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot]]'', published as a two-part miniseries by [[Dark Horse Comics]]. In 1999 it became an [[animated series]] on ''[[Fox Kids]]''. During this period, Miller became one of the founding members of the comic imprint Legend, under which many of his Sin City works were released, via Dark Horse.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Written and illustrated by Frank Miller with painted colors by Varley, [[300 (comics)|''300'']] was a 1998 comic-book [[miniseries]], released as a hardcover collection in 1999, retelling the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] and the events leading up to it from the perspective of [[Leonidas]] of Sparta. ''300'' was particularly inspired by the 1962 film ''[[The 300 Spartans]]'', a movie that Miller watched as a young boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comixology.com/articles/421/Into-the-Valley-of-Death-|title=Into the Valley of Death?|last1= Green|first1= Karen|date=December 3, 2010|quote=It's like something out of Hollywood, right?

Miller's previous attitude towards movie adaptations was to change after [[Robert Rodriguez]] made a short film based on a story from Miller's ''[[Sin City]]'' entitled "[[List of Sin City yarns#The Customer is Always Right|The Customer is Always Right]]". Miller was pleased with the result, leading to him and Rodriguez directing a full-length film, ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' using Miller's original comics panels as [[storyboards]]. The film was released in the U.S. on April 1, 2005. The film's success brought renewed attention to Miller's ''Sin City'' projects. Similarly, a film adaptation of ''[[300 (film)|300]]'', directed solely by [[Zack Snyder]], brought new attention and controversy to Miller's original comic book work.

==Legal issues==
In October 2012, Joanna Gallardo-Mills, who began working for Miller as an executive coordinator in November 2008, filed suit against Miller in Manhattan for discrimination and "mental anguish", stating that Miller's former girlfriend, Kimberly Cox, created a hostile work environment for Gallardo-Mills in Miller and Cox's [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] living and work space.&lt;ref&gt;Schram, Jamie (October 10, 2012).

In July 2011 at the San Diego Comic-Con International while promoting his upcoming graphic novel [[Holy Terror (graphic novel)|''Holy Terror'']] in which the protagonist hero fights [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists, Miller made a remark about [[Islamic terrorism]] and [[Islam]] saying, "I was raised [[Catholic]] and I could tell you a lot about the [[Spanish Inquisition]] but the mysteries of the [[Catholic Church]] elude me. And I could tell you a lot about [[Al-Qaeda]], but the mysteries of Islam elude me too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://collider.com/frank-miller-comic-con-holy-terror/|title= Comic-Con 2011: Frank Miller on ''Holy Terror'': 'I Hope This Book Really Pisses People Off'|first= Hunter|last= Daniels|work= [[Collider (website)|Collider]]|publisher= [[Complex (magazine)|Complex Media]]|date= July 23, 2011|accessdate= April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Miller posted remarks pertaining to the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement in his blog, calling it "nothing but a pack of louts, thieves, and rapists, fed by [[Woodstock]]-era nostalgia and putrid false righteousness." He said of the movement, "Wake up, pond scum. America is at war against a ruthless enemy.

Miller has since been romantically linked to New York-based Shakespearean scholar Kimberly Halliburton Cox,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/books/2011/06/kill-shakespeare-on-the-national.html "Comic book creators put their spin on Shakespeare"].

== Style and influence ==
[[File:Sin City Hard Goodbye.jpg|thumb|[[Marv (Sin City)|Marv]] walking through the rain in ''[[The Hard Goodbye]]'' cover by Frank Miller, illustrating Miller's [[film noir]]-influenced visual style]]
Although still conforming to traditional comic book styles, Miller infused his first issue of ''Daredevil'' with his own [[film noir]] style.&lt;ref name="ICv2"&gt;Flinn, Tom. "Writer's Spotlight: Frank Miller: Comics' Noir Auteur," ''ICv2: Guide to Graphic Novels'' #40 (Q1 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Miller sketched the roofs of New York in an attempt to give his ''Daredevil'' art an authentic feel not commonly seen in superhero comics at the time. One journalist noted,
{{quote|text=Daredevil's New York, under Frank's run, became darker and more dangerous than the Spider-Man New York he’d seemingly lived in before. New York City itself, particularly Daredevil's [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood, became as much a character as the shadowy crimefighter; the stories often took place on the rooftop level, with water towers, pipes and chimneys jutting out to create a skyline reminiscent of [[German Expressionism]]'s dramatic edges and shadows.&lt;ref&gt;Irving in NYCGraphicNovelists.com&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Ronin'' shows some of the strongest influences of [[manga]] and [[Franco-Belgian comics|bande dessinée]] on Miller's style, both in the artwork and narrative style.&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 202: The comic was an unusual blend of the influences on Miller by French cartoonist Moebius and Japanese Manga &lt;!--capitalized in the original source--&gt; comic books.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sin City'' was drawn in black and white to emphasize its [[film noir]] origins. Miller has said he opposes [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]] in comic art: "People are attempting to bring a superficial reality to superheroes which is rather stupid. They work best as the flamboyant fantasies they are. I mean, these are characters that are broad and big. I don't need to see sweat patches under [[Superman]]'s arms. I want to see him fly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= Hillhouse, Jason (writer) |date= 2005|title= Legends of the Dark Knight: The History of Batman |url=http://www.flixster.com/movie/legends-of-the-dark-knight-the-history-of-batman/ |format=DVD |publisher=New Wave Entertainment |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism and praise ===
''[[Daredevil: Born Again]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' were both critical successes and influential on subsequent generations of creators to the point of being considered classics of the medium. ''[[Batman: Year One]]'' was also met with praise for its gritty style, while comics including ''[[Ronin (DC Comics)|Ronin]]'', ''[[300 (comics)|300]]'' and ''[[Sin City]]'' were also successful, cementing Miller's place as a legend of comic books. However, later material such as ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'' received mixed reviews. In particular, ''[[All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder]]'' was widely considered a sign of Miller's creative decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.popmatters.com/comics/all-star-batman-robin-1-3.shtml |title=''All-Star Batman &amp; Robin'' #1–3 |first=William |last=Gatevackes |publisher=[[PopMatters.com]] |date=February 10, 2006 |accessdate=December 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msHPXkN2?url=http://www.popmatters.com/comics/all-star-batman-robin-1-3.shtml |archivedate=January 18, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biggers, Cliff.

Miller's graphic novel ''[[Holy Terror (graphic novel)|Holy Terror]]'' was accused of being [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/holy-terror-comic-is-islamophobic-say-critics|title= Holy Terror comic is 'Islamophobic', say critics|last1= Hernandez|first1= Michael|date= October 25, 2011|work= [[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|quote= Miller's mixing of Muslims and Arabs – the book never differentiates – with terrorists highlights Holy Terror's unflattering portrayal of Muslims.|accessdate= November 25, 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow comic book writer [[Alan Moore]] has described Miller's work from ''Sin City''-onward as [[homophobic]] and [[misogynistic]], despite praising his early ''Batman'' and ''Daredevil'' material. Moore previously penned a flattering introduction to an early collected edition of ''The Dark Knight Returns'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/06/alan-moore-frank-miller-row?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London |work=[[The Guardian]] | first=Alison | last=Flood | title=Alan Moore attacks Frank Miller in comic book war of words | date=December 6, 2011| accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two have remained friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnWT5jxkMSM|title= Frank Miller parla di Alan Moore e di Batman V Superman|date= September 15, 2014|publisher= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller would later say that he regrets ''Holy Terror'', saying, "I don’t want to wipe out chapters of my own biography. But I'm not capable of that book again."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

In terms of Miller's film career, his [[The Spirit (film)|2008 adaptation]] of ''[[The Spirit]]'' received negative reviews, earning a metascore of 30/100 at [[Metacritic.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/spirit2008?q=the%20spirit | title=The Spirit | publisher=Metacritic.com | accessdate= December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, his [[Sin City (film)|film adaptation]] of ''Sin City'' was well received by audiences and critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/sin-city|title=''Sin City'' Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Films ==
* ''[[RoboCop 2]]''—Miller's original script was heavily edited through rewrites as it was deemed unfilmable. The original script was adapted in 2003 by [[Steven Grant]] into the comics series, ''[[Frank Miller's RoboCop]]''.
* ''[[RoboCop 3]]''—Miller co-wrote this with the film's director [[Fred Dekker]]. The original script was adapted in 2013–2014 by Steven Grant into the comics series, ''[[RoboCop (comics)#RoboCop: Last Stand|RoboCop: Last Stand]]''.
* ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''—Miller made his directorial debut in this 2005 adaptation of his [[Sin City]] yarns, co-directing with [[Robert Rodriguez]].
* ''[[300 (film)|300]]''—Miller was a producer for the film, which adapted [[300 (comics)|the original comics series]], shot-for-shot, into a feature film in 2007.
* ''[[The Spirit (film)|The Spirit]]''—Although Miller co-directed ''Sin City'', this 2008 film was his first solo directing project.
* ''[[Batman: Year One (film)|Batman: Year One]]''—This was co-written and was due to be directed by [[Darren Aronofsky]] until [[Warner Bros.]] cancelled the project opting for [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[Batman Begins]]''. It was finally adapted into an animated film, produced by [[Bruce Timm]], resulting in a [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-home-media]] released in October, 2011.
* ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (film)|Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]''—A two-part direct-to-DVD animated film based on ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' was released in 2012 and 2013 respectively.
*''[[Sin City: A Dame to Kill For]]''—In 2005, after ''Sin City'' was released, Robert Rodriguez announced plans for a follow-up film that would feature many of the same characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Briggs | first=Caroline | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4561547.stm | title=Sin City writer defends violence |publisher=BBC | date=May 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He planned for the film to be based on ''[[A Dame to Kill For]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/618/618310p1.html | title=''Sin City'' Sequel in the Works | publisher=IGN | date=May 23, 2005 | accessdate= March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller said the film would be a [[prequel]] and a [[sequel]] with interlinking stories both before and after the first film. Miller, who was writing the screenplay in 2006, had anticipated for production to begin later in the year. The film, co-directed by Miller and Rodriguez, was released in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Vineyard | first=Jennifer | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1527380/sin-city-characters-returning-sequel.jhtml | title=''Sin City'' Characters – Even Dead Ones – Returning For Sequel | publisher=MTV | date=March 29, 2006 | accessdate= March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film version of ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'' (2003) predominantly used the tone established and stories written by Miller, who had no direct creative input on the film (except for a [[cameo appearance]]). In ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]'' (2005), Miller received credit for "comic book characters". ''[[The Wolverine (2013 film)|The Wolverine]]'' (2013) was inspired by the 1982 ''Wolverine'' miniseries that Miller penciled with writer [[Chris Claremont]].
