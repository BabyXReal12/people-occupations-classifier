'''Ed Brubaker''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|uː|b|eɪ|k|ər}}; born November 17, 1966)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller |first=John Jackson|authorlink= John Jackson Miller|url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |title=Comics Industry Birthdays |work=[[Comics Buyer's Guide]] |date=June 10, 2005 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5trAbNQWw?url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |archivedate=October 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American comic book writer and [[cartoonist]]. Brubaker's first early comics work was primarily in the [[crime fiction]] genre with works such as ''[[Lowlife (comics)|Lowlife]]'', ''The Fall'', ''Sandman Presents: Dead Boy Detectives'' and ''[[Scene of the Crime (comics)|Scene of the Crime]]''. He later became known for writing [[superhero]] comics such as ''[[Batman]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'',  ''[[Captain America]]'', ''[[Catwoman]]'', ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', and ''[[The Authority (comics)|The Authority]]''.  He has won an [[Eisner Award]] on six separate occasions.

==Career==

===Alternative and independent comics work===
Brubaker's first work in comics was as a cartoonist, writing and drawing ''Pajama Chronicles'' and penciling a "Gumby 3D" issue for [[Blackthorne Comics]], ''Purgatory U.S.A.'' for [[Slave Labor Graphics]], and the semi-autobiographical series ''Lowlife'' for [[Caliber Comics]] and later [[Aeon Press]]. At Caliber, he briefly edited the anthology series ''Monkey Wrench''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.calibercomics.com/Creators/notablecreators.html|title= Notable Beginnings|date= n.d.|publisher= [[Caliber Comics]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120206190607/http://www.calibercomics.com/Creators/notablecreators.html|archivedate= February 6, 2012|deadurl= yes|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, he began contributing [[crime stories]] to the [[Dark Horse Comics]] anthology series ''[[Dark Horse Presents]]'', a comic he would continue to contribute to intermittently throughout the decade. Among those contributions was the three part serial "An Accidental Death" (''Dark Horse Presents'' #65–67), a collaboration with artist [[Eric Shanower]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/brubaker.htm|title= Ed Brubaker|date= June 15, 2012 |publisher= [[Lambiek|Lambiek Comiclopedia]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131112050923/http://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/brubaker.htm|archivedate=November 12, 2013 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which garnered the two a 1993 [[Eisner Award]] nomination.

In 1997, he began to publish his cartoonist work through the [[small press]] publisher [[Alternative Comics (publisher)|Alternative Comics]]. In the one-off ''At the Seams'', a romantic triangle is explored through three stories which each depict a different participant's point-of-view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.indyworld.com/brubaker/review5.html|title= Ed Brubaker Reviews|first= John|last= Sekerka|date= Winter 1997|publisher= IndyWorld.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110924000659/http://www.indyworld.com/brubaker/review5.html|archivedate= September 24, 2011|deadurl= no|accessdate= November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic was a 1997 [[Ignatz Award]] nominee for Outstanding Graphic Novel or Collection. His other work for Alternative Comics, the humorous and experimental ''Detour'' No. 1, was to be the first issue of a series, though only one issue was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.indyworld.com/brubaker/|title= Ed Brubaker's ''Detour''|date= n.d.|publisher= IndyWorld.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120205203244/http://www.indyworld.com/brubaker/|archivedate= February 5, 2012|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Detour'' was nominated for the "Best New Series" Harvey Award in 1998.

''The Fall'', a graphic novel that was written by Brubaker and illustrated by ''[[Berlin (comics)|Berlin]]'' creator [[Jason Lutes]] was published by [[Drawn and Quarterly]] in 2001. This work had previously been anthologized in five parts in ''Dark Horse Presents'' in 1998. The story involved a convenience store clerk who gets involved in a ten-year-old murder mystery after he uses a stolen credit card. In 2004 [[IDW Publishing]] announced that Brubaker and artist [[Sean Phillips]] would collaborate on a [[Creator ownership|creator owned]] [[Piracy|pirate]] series titled ''Black Sails'' for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=4068|title= Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips Set ''Black Sails'' For IDW Publishing|first= Jonah|last= Weiland|date= September 26, 2004|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120722024436/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=4068|archivedate= July 22, 2012|deadurl= no|accessdate= November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That series has not yet been published and ''The Fall'' remained the last independent comic book work by Brubaker until his work for Image Comics, which began in 2012.

===DC Comics===
Predating Brubaker's [[Alternative Comics (publisher)|Alternative Comics]] work by two years, ''Vertigo Visions: [[Prez (DC Comics)|Prez]], Smells Like Teen President'' (1995) was Brubaker's first work for one of the two major American comic book publishers. Published by [[DC Comics]]' "mature readers" imprint [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]], the comic was a broad [[political satire]] which revamped an obscure 1970s [[Joe Simon]] creation. Brubaker worked with his "An Accidental Death" collaborator, artist Eric Shanower, again on the comic.

Brubaker's next major work for Vertigo was the ''[[Scene of the Crime (comics)|Scene of the Crime]]'' four issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] in 1999, which marked his first collaboration with both [[Michael Lark]] and Sean Phillips, two artists who would frequently work with the writer in later years. A [[slacker]] detective story set in San Francisco, the series was critically acclaimed and the first to gain Brubaker attention from Hollywood producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/01/scene-crime-back-print-last |title=''Scene of the Crime'': back in print at last |first=Alex |last=Hern |date=January 6, 2013 |publisher=''[[New Statesman]]'' |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6L4889T1O?url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/01/scene-crime-back-print-last |archivedate=November 12, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=November 11, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2000, Brubaker signed an exclusive contract with DC Comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Booker|first = M. Keith|title = Encyclopedia of Comic Books and Graphic Novels|publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year = 2010|location= Santa Barbara, California|page = 73|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YbkJ0QJrEZ8C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=Ed+Brubaker+contract+with+DC+Comics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SAZsD1neb6&amp;sig=-DUEjwFr8YtywOw3aLs7r0QdbPM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_qmBUtrwCuGEyAH_lIHIBw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ed%20Brubaker%20contract%20with%20DC%20Comics&amp;f=false|isbn = 978-0313357466}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he began to do his first mainstream [[super-hero]] work, on the series ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' starting with issue #582 (Oct. 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dougall|first2=Alastair, ed.|chapter= 2000s|title= Batman: A Visual History|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2014|location= London, United Kingdom|page= 252|isbn= 978-1465424563|quote= Ed Brubaker became a regular Batman scribe with this issue, partnering with artist Scott McDaniel.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would continue to work on various series starring the Batman character until late 2003 including such story arcs as "Bruce Wayne: Murderer?"&lt;ref&gt;Manning "2000s" in Dougall (2014), p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Bruce Wayne: Fugitive]]".&lt;ref&gt;Manning "2000s" in Dougall (2014), p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Vertigo in 2000, Brubaker and artist [[Warren Pleece]] produced the science fiction series ''[[Deadenders]]''. The series lasted 16 issues before being canceled in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Irvine|first = Alex|author-link = Alexander C. Irvine |contribution = Deadenders|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The Vertigo Encyclopedia|page = 53|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|location= London, United Kingdom|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4122-5|oclc = 213309015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staying with Vertigo in 2001, Brubaker wrote the four issue ''[[Dead Boy Detectives|Sandman Presents: Dead Boy Detectives]]'', which was drawn by artist [[Bryan Talbot]].

Also in 2001, Brubaker and artist [[Darwyn Cooke]] teamed up to revamp the [[Catwoman]] character. They started with the four issue serial "Trail of the Catwoman" which ran in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #759–762. In the serial, private detective [[Slam Bradley]] attempts to investigate the death of Selina Kyle (aka Catwoman). The story led into a new ''Catwoman'' title in late 2001 by Brubaker and Cooke in which the character's [[costume]], supporting cast and [[modus operandi]] were all redesigned and redeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowsill|first= Alan|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 2000s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9|page= 304|quote = One of DC's longest running characters got a makeover courtesy of writer Ed Brubaker and artist Darwyn Cooke as ''Catwoman'' was relaunched...With Brubaker's tight, noir-like scripting and Darwyn Cooke's stylish artwork, ''Catwoman's'' new direction made the character more popular than ever.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brubaker stayed on the series until No. 37 (January 2004).

Brubaker and Marvel writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] discussed co-writing a story which would team up DC's Batman with Marvel's [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. The two writers were enthusiastic about their ideas, which included a fight between Batman and Marvel villain [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] as well as another between Catwoman and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]. DC editors Matt Idelson and Bob Schreck were also enthusiastic, but DC Publisher [[Paul Levitz]] objected to the project due to a prior disagreement with Marvel editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=3899|title= Chicago, Day 1: Bendis Panel Goes Wild|first= Seth|last= Jones|date= August 13, 2004|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120722080306/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=3899|archivedate= July 22, 2012|deadurl= no|accessdate= November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2003, Brubaker and writer [[Greg Rucka]] created and co-wrote the ''[[Gotham Central]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;Cowsill "2000s" in Dolan, p. 308: "Presented by writers Ed Brubaker and Greg Rucka, with art by Michael Lark, the series followed the night and day shifts of the Gotham City Police Department."&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing on the activities of the [[Gotham City Police Department]], the two writers either co-wrote storylines or wrote alternate arcs separately throughout the series, which featured artwork from Brubaker's ''Scene of the Crime'' collaborator Michael Lark. The title was cancelled in 2006, shortly after Brubaker's last issue.

====Wildstorm====
In 2002 Brubaker did his first work for [[Wildstorm]], another DC imprint, with the series ''[[Point Blank (comics)|Point Blank]]'' which featured the artwork of New Zealand artist [[Colin Wilson (comics)|Colin Wilson]]. The series took existing concepts from the Wildstorm universe, such as [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]] (the star of the series), [[John Lynch (comics)|John Lynch]] and [[Tao (comics)|Tao]] and used them to set up his  ''[[Sleeper (comics)|Sleeper]]'' series which debuted later that year.

A collaboration between artist [[Sean Phillips]] and Brubaker, ''Sleeper'', featured a secret agent protagonist ("Holden Carver") who goes undercover in a super villain's powerful organisation, only to have the only contact he has in law enforcement fall into a coma. With the authorities believing him a dangerous criminal, Carver is caught between the two warring sides with unclear allegiances.

In December 2003, in a unique publicity stunt conceived to help promote the first trade paperback collection of ''Sleeper'', Brubaker organized an "[[arm-wrestling]] competition" at San Francisco's "Isotope – the comic book lounge" comic book shop. If participants were able to beat Brubaker at arm wrestling they were awarded free signed comic books. According to Brubaker, the writer wrestled 40–50 people and won most of the time, losing only eight or nine times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7423|title= Ed Brubaker: After the Arm Wrasslin'|first= Ed|last= Brubaker|date= December 22, 2003|publisher= [[Newsarama]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040204155611/http://newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=7423|archivedate= February 4, 2004|deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Sleeper'' was a success with critics and fans on the Internet, the series underperformed commercially, and so it was canceled after its twelfth issue. It was relaunched in 2004 with the same creators as ''Sleeper: Season Two''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=3267|title= Make Mine Ed: Ed Brubaker talks ''Sleeper Season Two'' &amp; ''Gotham Central''|first= Arune|last= Singh|date= March 16, 2004|publisher= Comic Book resources|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121102192702/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=3267|archivedate= November 2, 2012|deadurl= no|accessdate= November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also ended with its twelfth issue.

Brubaker's other work for Wildstorm during this period was the third volume of ''[[Authority (comics)|The Authority]]''. Brubaker first tackled the characters with artist [[Jim Lee]] on the one issue special ''Coup D'état: Sleeper'' which showed how a series of events led the Authority (a powerful team of super-humans) to take over the United States. Later that year and throughout 2005 Brubaker and artist [[Dustin Nguyen (artist)|Dustin Nguyen]] produced the 12 issue ''The Authority: Revolution'' which explored the ramifications of the team's actions.

===Marvel Comics===

In late 2004 Brubaker, no longer exclusive to DC, began to work for their main competitor [[Marvel Comics]]. His first major work for the publisher was volume five of the ''[[Captain America]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 2000s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 325|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= When acclaimed writer Ed Brubaker made the switch from DC to Marvel, he brought with him yet another relaunch for Steve Rogers. A critical and financial hit, this new ''Captain America'' series featured the art of realistic draftsman Steve Epting.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paired with artist [[Steve Epting]], Brubaker's ''Captain America'' introduced new villains and resurrected the long dead character [[Bucky Barnes]] as "[[Winter Soldier (comics)|The Winter Soldier]]". The series was a sales and critical success from its first issue. Brubaker continued on this series for eight full years, from November 2004 to October 2012, alongside sister titles and limited series based around the character.

In February 2005 Brubaker signed his first exclusive contract with Marvel, the deal allowing the writer to finish out his prior commitments for DC on ''[[Gotham Central]]'' and ''[[Sleeper (comics)|Sleeper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;old=1&amp;id=4781|title= Official: Marvel Announces Ed Brubaker Exclusive|first= Jonah|last= Weiland|date= February 7, 2005|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131101230034/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;old=1&amp;id=4781|archivedate= November 1, 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2006 Brubaker wrote two limited series for Marvel; with artist Pablo Raimondi, he wrote ''[[Books of Doom]]'', which retold and expanded on the origin of [[Doctor Doom]]; and with artist [[Trevor Hairsine]], he wrote ''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'', ret-conning information about the origins of the "[[X-Men|All New, All-Different X-Men]]" who debuted in 1975.

In February 2010, a controversy arose with ''Captain America'' No. 602, which depicted a group of anti-tax protesters, understood by some readers to be a [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]], which was characterized by the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] as exclusively white and racist group. Brubaker and Marvel editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] apologized for the matter, explaining that although the group was not intended by Brubaker to represent any particular real-life group, one of the signs depicted in the scene read, "Tea Bag The Libs Before They Tea Bag YOU!", which was not written by Brubaker, but was added by letterer Joe Caramagna, who, under deadline pressures, added messages on signs that were found to still be blank, based on signs he saw on the Internet. Quesada further assured that the error would not appear in future reprints of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=24784|title= Political Controversy &amp; The Heroic Age|first1= Kiel|last1= Phegley|first2= Joe|last2= Quesada|date= February 10, 2010|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131109181058/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=24784|archivedate= November 9, 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/02/09/tea-party-reference-captain-america-removed/?test=latestnews |title=Tea Party Jab to Be Zapped From Captain America Comic, Writer Says |first=Joshua Rhett |last=Miller |date=February 10, 2010 |publisher=[[Fox News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204013753/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/02/09/tea-party-reference-captain-america-removed/?test=latestnews |archivedate=February 4, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oregonherald.com/news/show-story.cfm?id=121462|title= Marvel Comics' depiction of anti-tax protesters inspires anger, apology|first= Brett Michael|last= Dykes|date= February 11, 2010|publisher= ''[[Oregon Herald]]''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131112052718/http://www.oregonherald.com/news/show-story.cfm?id=121462|archivedate= November 12, 2013|deadurl= yes|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview following the controversy Brubaker stated that "I had to shut down my public email because I started getting death threats from, y'know, peaceful protesters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://io9.com/5523704/ed-brubaker-talks-secret-avengers-receiving-death-threats-for-writing-captain-america|title= Ed Brubaker Talks ''Secret Avengers'', Receiving Death Threats For Writing ''Captain America''|first= Cyriaque|last= Lamar|date= April 24, 2010|publisher= [[io9]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121006073859/http://io9.com/5523704/ed-brubaker-talks-secret-avengers-receiving-death-threats-for-writing-captain-america|archivedate= October 6, 2012|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
