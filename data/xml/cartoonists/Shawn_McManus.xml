}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Americans|American]] [[artist]] who has worked extensively over three decades for [[DC Comics]] and other companies, notably for DC's [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] imprint including the ''[[Fables (comics)|Fables]]'' series.

==Comics==
Born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], McManus entered the comics field in the early 1980s with work for ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' and [[DC Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/mcmanus_shawn.htm|title= Shawn McManus|date= December 19, 2006|publisher= [[Lambiek|Lambiek Comiclopedia]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120505181711/http://lambiek.net/artists/m/mcmanus_shawn.htm|archivedate= May 5, 2012|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the June 1983 issue of ''Heavy Metal'' he collaborated with [[Bhob Stewart]] and John Coffey on "Zenobia". Six months later, McManus and Stewart teamed with [[Jim McDermott (illustrator)|Jim McDermott]] on "Symbiosis", also in ''Heavy Metal'' (December 1983).&lt;ref name="GCD"&gt;{{gcdb|type=credit|search= Shawn+McManus|title= Shawn McManus}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew the [[Green Arrow]] backup feature in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' in 1983-1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Kingman|first = Jim|title = The Ballad of Ollie and Dinah|journal = [[Back Issue!]]|issue = 64|page = 19|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = May 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; McManus gained wider attention when he illustrated two issues of ''[[Swamp Thing (comic book)|The Saga of the Swamp Thing]]'' written by [[Alan Moore]].

McManus worked with writer [[Todd Klein]] on ''[[Omega Men]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kleinletters.com/Blog/creating-go-freelance/|title= Creating ''Go Freelance!''|first= Todd|last= Klein|authorlink= Todd Klein|date= October 18, 2011|publisher= Kleinletters.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130531050938/http://kleinletters.com/Blog/creating-go-freelance/|archivedate= May 31, 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating [[Zirral]] and other characters for that series. He has drawn issues of ''[[Doctor Fate]]'' and ''[[Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight]]''.&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt; He collaborated with [[Neil Gaiman]] on the "[[The Sandman: Fables &amp; Reflections|Fables &amp; Reflections]]" and "[[The Sandman: A Game of You|A Game of You]]" story arcs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Bender|first = Hy|title = The Sandman Companion|publisher = DC Comics|year = 1999|location= New York, New York

:I thought Shawn McManus's art was great. I'd like to work with him again sometime, though we didn't really work together here. At the time I wrote it, I had no idea who'd be drawing it. Shawn and I have never even met or spoken with each other. I always write full script though, and unlike some other artists, Shawn actually pays attention to the script. I think his artwork was a nice pairing with the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/Rozum|title= Interview With John Rozum|first= Kuljit|last= Mithra|date= January 2001|publisher= Manwithoutfear.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131110234234/http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-interviews/Rozum|archivedate= November 10, 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked on [[Leah Moore]] and [[John Reppion]]'s ''[[Wild Girl (comics)|Wild Girl]]'' ([[Wildstorm]], 2004–2005) with [[J. H. Williams III]], about 13-year-old Rosa Torez who discovers that she can communicate with animals. In 2007, he did an eight-issue run on ''[[Aquaman]]: Sword of Atlantis'' and an issue of ''[[Creeper (comics)|The Creeper]]'' for DC.&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt;

==Children's art==
Writer-illustrator and lecturer Mark McKenna, creator of the ''Banana Tail'' children's book series, described his long association with McManus that led to their ''Banana Tail: The Early Years'' (2009) color print:
:I met Shawn McManus in the DC Comics offices back in late 1985. I was up at DC Comics to meet with an editor or show samples, I forget, the old brain is failing me here. But I do recall Shawn sitting in with the editor who I was about to have a meeting with. At the time, Shawn was drawing ''Swamp Thing'', and I was delighted to see his lively, bouncy and very refreshing art style. Little did I know that within a year we would be an art team along with writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]] on DC's ''Doctor Fate'' series... We worked together for six months on ''Doctor Fate'' until the DC editor moved me to another book. I haven't had any creative contact with Shawn since that time in 1987. We really never spoke during the time we worked together. I was still very new to the business and didn't think to call and collaborate with Shawn to get his sensibilities about direction and vision for the book. No contact with Shawn until a few brief comic con "how ya doing's?", and an eventual reconnect through our mutual art rep, Bob Shaw... Bob had this idea that Shawn should work with me and create some ultra cool ''Banana Tail'' painting... Seeing Bob Shaw's excitement, Shawn then saw the potential in ''Banana Tail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bananatail.com/spotlight-on.html|title= McManus meet McKennus |first= Mark|last= McKenna|date= n.d.|publisher= BananaTail.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120222152110/http://bananatail.com/spotlight-on.html|archivedate= February 22, 2012|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
In 1987, McManus worked on the animated series ''[[Dinosaucers]]''. For the TV series ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', McManus and [[Mike Vosburg]] illustrated comic book covers designed to look like the original [[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|1950s comics]]. The McManus ''Crypt'' cover is seen in the first episode ("The Man Who Was Death").

==Awards==
1985 [[Kirby Award|Jack Kirby Award]] nomination with Alan Moore for Best Single Issue ("Pog" in ''The Saga of the Swamp Thing'' #32).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/kirby85.php|title= 1985 Jack Kirby Awards|publisher= Hahn Library Comic Book Awards Almanac|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130927113611/http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/kirby85.php|archivedate= September 27, 2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
