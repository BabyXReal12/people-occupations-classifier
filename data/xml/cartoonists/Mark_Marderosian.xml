'''Mark Marderosian''' (born 1955) is a prolific [[cartoonist]], [[animator]] and children's book [[illustrator]], a [[comic book artist]] and noted toy designer.&lt;ref name="HTMII"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/10/26/here_the_magic_is_imagination/|title=Newton artist's characters give kids the tools of imagination|website=Boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born in Cambridge, Marderosian grew up in Newton, MA. He says that he started drawing when he was seven years old, after his parents took him to see  [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|''Pinocchio'']]. After high school Marderosian worked for advertising agencies and an art supply company, where he prepared paste-ups and mechanicals for catalogs. He also drew cartoons and comic strips and freelanced for a few magazines at the same time. In 1979, Marderosian enrolled at [[Massachusetts College of Art]].&lt;ref name="HTMII" /&gt;

Mark Marderosian created the ''Delta Tenn'' comic books for  [[Paul Howley|Paul Howley's]] Entertainment Publishing in 1987–88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atomicavenue.com/atomic/TitleDetail.aspx?TitleID=18082|title=Delta Tenn|website=atomicavenue.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked with [[Paul Howley|Howley]] on the design of a set of ''Classic Toys Trading Cards'' around the same time.

===Disney years===
After an early-career rejection, Marderosian "finally did get his foot in the Disney door in 1990,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/newton/archive/x1319857742 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120919015854/http://www.wickedlocal.com/newton/archive/x1319857742 |archivedate=2012-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; working on merchandise related to [[Jessica Rabbit]]. Over the course of his career, Marderosian has gone on to illustrate several dozen movie and television tie-in books for [[Disney]], as well as for [[Golden Books]]. He has also provided illustrations for other licensed merchandise such as character figurines, story books and coloring books. Among the many characters he has drawn are [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Mulan (Disney character)|Mulan]], [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|The Little Mermaid]], [[Hello Kitty]], and [[Jimmy Neutron]]. He is most identified with work on merchandise and books featuring the [[Disney Princesses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lambiek.net/artists/m/marderosian_mark.htm|title=Mark Marderosian|website=lambiek.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1225933760/ref=sr_pg_1?ie=UTF8&amp;rs=&amp;keywords=Mark%20Marderosian&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3AMark%20Marderosian&amp;page=1|title=Amazon.com: Mark Marderosian|website=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Because of the constant reprinting, especially in coloring books, somewhere there’s someone looking at something I drew every single day," mused Marderosian.&lt;ref name="Gotsis"&gt;By Chloe Gotsis, Posted Dec 22, 2011 @ 02:03 PM, [http://www.wickedlocal.com/newton/news/x1282420671/Newton-Person-of-the-Week-Mark-Marderosian-cartoonist-and-Newton-resident#axzz1hKAbsQDT "Newton Person of the Week: Mark Marderosian, cartoonist and Newton resident"], ''Wicked Local Newton''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editorial cartoonist===
Marderosian began working as the [[editorial cartoonist]] for the Newton TAB around 2006. "There aren’t as many editorial cartoonists in this country as there used to be and I’m happy to be able to practice my art and offer my opinions in this manner every week," he said.&lt;ref name="Gotsis" /&gt;

===Television show===
In 2007, he designed and successfully marketed his own collection of children's stuffed animals called "Angels from the Attic". Each toy set includes a related story book. A coloring book is planned.&lt;ref name="HTMII" /&gt;

In 2010, Marderosian and [[designer]]/[[animator]] Robert Palmer Jr. created a [[television]] program called "Drawing With Mark." Their children’s media company, Big City Publishing, which sells storybooks, coloring books, flash cards, and puzzles, offered to provide the program free of charge to [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] stations. The show has been called "a simple, old-fashioned TV show... that teaches kids how to draw." His "Angels from the Attic" characters appear on the show in animated from. Within five months after the first episode, the program was accepted by 105 Public-access television channels that serve about 150 cities and towns across 25 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Don|last=Aucoin |date=June 19, 2010 |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2010/06/19/a_public_access_show_in_newton_on_teaching_kids_to_draw_has_been_picked_up_nationwide/?page=full |title=They’re making a mark |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The show’s overall theme is about helping kids unlock their creativity, especially in these days of brutal budget cuts on so many institutions, which are struggling to present creativity and art in various forms," Marderosian said.&lt;ref name="Gotsis" /&gt;

In 2013, the Boston/New England Chapter of the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] nominated "Drawing with Mark" for a Regional Emmy award in the Children's/Youth category.&lt;ref&gt;Newton TAB columnist Mark Marderosian nominated for an Emmy - Newton, Massachusetts - Newton TAB http://www.wickedlocal.com/newton/news/x94502953/Newton-TAB-columnist-Mark-Marderosian-nominated-for-an-Emmy#ixzz2SkZ68r4Z Under Creative Commons License: Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike&lt;/ref&gt;
