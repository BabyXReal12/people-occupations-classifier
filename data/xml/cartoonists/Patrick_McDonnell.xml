'''Patrick McDonnell''' (born March 17, 1956) is a cartoonist, author and playwright.  He is the creator of the daily [[comic strip]], ''[[Mutts]]''. 

McDonnell's picture book, The Gift of Nothing, was adapted as a musical for the Kennedy Center stage, as was his picture book about the childhood of [[Jane Goodall]], ''Me…Jane'', which won a [[Caldecott Honor]] in 2012. Prior to creating ''Mutts'', McDonnell was a freelance illustrator, drawing the [[Russell Baker]] Observer column for the [[New York Times]] Sunday Magazine from 1978-1993. He also created Bad Baby, a monthly comic strip for [[Parents Magazine]], which ran for 10 years. During that time he also was a regular contributor to [[Sports Illustrated]], [[Reader's Digest]], [[Forbes]], [[Time (magazine)|Time]] and many other national magazines. His work has been animated for television commercials, most notably a PSA for the [[NY Philharmonic]]. He is coauthor of ''[[Krazy Kat]]: The Comic Art of [[George Herriman]]'', published in 1986 by [[Abrams Books|Abrams]].  

==Early life==
McDonnell was born in [[Edison, New Jersey]], from an Irish father and an Italian-descendent mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fiamma|first=Andrea|language=it|title=20 anni di Mutts. Intervista a Patrick McDonnell|url=http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150349717727844|publisher=[[Fumettologica]]|accessdate=March 16, 2016|date=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[Edison High School (New Jersey)|Edison High School]] in 1974, McDonnell attended the [[School of Visual Arts]] on scholarship,&lt;ref&gt;Conte, Annemarie. "His Name is Earl". New Jersey Monthly. February 6, 2008. Accessed June 21, 2011. "After graduating from New York's School of Visual Arts in the early 1980s, McDonnell moved to Hoboken, where there was a community of underground cartoonists."&lt;/ref&gt; graduating in 1978.

==Career==
McDonnell began a career as a magazine illustrator and would frequently include a dog in the background of his illustrations.
&lt;ref&gt;Hurley-Schubert. "Middlesex County cartoonist's pets inspire comic strip". Home News Tribune. July 21, 2003. Accessed June 21, 2011. "McDonnell a 1974 Edison High School graduate started his career as a magazine illustrator. He always drew a little dog somewhere in the background..."&lt;/ref&gt; Moving to [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], he met a group of underground cartoonists such as [[Peter Bagge]] and [[Kazimieras G. Prapuolenis]] (Kaz), and had some of his earliest drawings appearing in The Village Voice, and as Jerseyana in [[New Jersey Monthly magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;Conte, Annemarie. "His Name is Earl". New Jersey Monthly. February 6, 2008. Accessed June 21, 2011. "After graduating from New York's School of Visual Arts in the early 1980s, McDonnell moved to Hoboken, where there was a community of underground cartoonists."&lt;/ref&gt; A book of his life and work, ''Mutts: The Comic Art of Patrick McDonnell'', was published in 2003 by Abrams Publishing.

McDonnell is involved with many animal and environmental charities. His characters have been enlisted by the [[United States Marines]] (2006 [[Toys for Tots]] holiday poster), the [[American Library Association]] (2007 ‘Read!' poster), and by The [[HSUS]] (humane postage stamps). The MUTTS characters appear on the [[New Jersey Animal Friendly]] license plates which fund state pet population programs. The 2007-2008 [[Mazdaspeed|MAZDASPEED]] Team featured MUTTS-themed vehicles promoting pet adoption and the work of [[The Humane Society of the United States]].

In 2009 McDonnell collaborated with author [[Eckhart Tolle]] to create ''[[Guardians of Being]]'', a philosophical book about nature and the present moment.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, Ken (October 22, 2009). "Eckhart Tolle vs. God". Maclean's.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, McDonnell's children's book ''Me...Jane'' was published. It is a story about naturalist [[Jane Goodall]] growing up and her awakening curiosity about the lives of animals around her. A sequence of MUTTS strips led to Goodall's interest in working with McDonnell on the book. &lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/reigning-cat-and-dog-an-interview-with-mutts-creator-patrick-mcdonnell/ ''Reigning Cat and Dog'', Hogan's Alley #20]&lt;/ref&gt; Me, Jane won a [[Caldecott Medal|Caldecott Honor]] in 2012.
