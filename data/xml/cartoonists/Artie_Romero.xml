'''Artie Edward Romero''' (born in [[Springfield, Missouri]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artie.com/cm/art/artists/artieromero/artiesinterview.htm 1997 interview on ARG! Cartoon Animation's official website.] Accessed May 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[cartoonist]], [[animator]], producer, director and [[publisher]]. He began his career in [[comic books]] at a young age in the 1970s, and now is best known for his [[animation]] work.

==Early life==

The first child of Wilma and Artie Thomas, he was born in 1951 in Springfield, Missouri, and named Artie Edward Thomas, Jr. His parents' tumultuous marriage produced three more sons before ending in divorce in 1962. Wilma then married Jose Santiago Romero, and Jose adopted the four boys, changing their names to Romero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artie.com/romero.html Biography on ARG! website]. Accessed May 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romero decided to pursue a career as an artist while he was still in high school. His work was published in his school's literary magazine, and he became fascinated with the technical aspects of printing and publishing. In 1968 he joined the staff of [[Carl Gafford]]'s New Milford, Connecticut based fanzine ''Minotaur'' as a co-editor. Romero recruited fellow student artists and writers to create a magazine, and in January, 1969, the first issue of ''Platinum Toad'' appeared. Printed on the school's duplicator, it included poems by co-editor Tom Haber, a cover by Romero, comics by George Laws and [[Robert Crumb]] (an unauthorized reprint of Crumb's "Keep On Truckin'"), a short story by Martha Ann Kennedy, and assorted artwork.

==Comics and publishing==

In his school years Romero published original illustrations by [[Frank Frazetta]], [[Vaughn Bode]], [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] and [[Michael William Kaluta]] in his comics and [[science fiction fanzine]] ''Realm'' (1969–72).&lt;ref&gt;Realm #5, 1972, Art Nouveau Publications, Springfield MO.&lt;/ref&gt; He dropped out of college to help found Everyman Studios, an artists' collective. Other founding members of Everyman Studios include illustrators [[Rick Berry (artist)|Rick Berry]] and Darrel Anderson, who later founded Braid Media Arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.braid.com/ Darrel Anderson's Braid Media Arts]. Accessed May 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974–75, Anderson and Romero were co-editors of a Colorado Springs alternative newspaper, ''The Everyman Flyer'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://lambiek.net/artists/r/romero_artie.htm Artie Romero in the Lambiek Comiclopedia]. Accessed May 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; which included underground comix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artie.com/everyman.htm Everyman Studios homepage on ARG!]. Accessed May 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1978 to 1981, Romero edited and published ''Cascade Comix Monthly'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://undergroundcollectibles.com/collections/cascade-comix Cascade Comix Monthly on Underground Collectibles]. Accessed June 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artie.com/cascade.htm Cascade Comix Monthly on ARG! Cartoon Animation]. Accessed May 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[fanzine]] about [[underground comix]] with news and artist interviews, including [[Art Spiegelman]], [[Denis Kitchen]], [[Dan O'Neill]], [[Gilbert Shelton]] and [[Trina Robbins]]. ''Cascade'' also published original comix and art by [[S. Clay Wilson]], [[Spain Rodriguez]], [[Skip Williamson]], [[M. K. Brown]], [[Jay Lynch]] and other pioneering underground comix artists. Several full-size underground comix, tabloids and a series of 21 [[minicomics]] with color covers were published under Everyman Comics' imprint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sirrealcomix.mrainey.com/page/_sets/Everyman.htm Sir Real's Underground Comix Catalog - Everyman Comics]. Accessed May 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Romero's minicomics were reprinted, including their color covers, in Fantagraphics' 2010 anthology, ''Newave! The Underground Mini Comix of the 1980s''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comicrelated.com/news/5494/newave ''Newave! The Underground Mini Comix of the 1980s'', reviewed by Richard Krauss]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animator, producer and director==

While attending college, Romero began working on animation projects&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.care2.com/ecards/bio/1227 Interview on Care2.com]. Accessed May 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; such as music videos, TV commercials and movie titles. He continued to do so from 1981 through 1994 as Everyman Studios, then in 1994 he founded ARG! Cartoon Animation Studio. ARG! currently produces animation for movies, television and the Web. Romero's screen credits include digital effects animation for ''[[Johnny Mnemonic]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113481/fullcredits Johnny Mnemonic credits on IMDB]. Accessed May 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; (Sony Pictures, 1995), and animated cartoon segments for a children's program, ''TV Planet'' (Rocky Mountain PBS, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/tv-planet/oclc/43956379 TV Planet on WorldCat].

===Early work===

In 1981, Romero's publishing company Everyman Studios expanded into commercial animation production, hiring animators William Kirk Kennedy, Jan Johnson and Roy W. Smith, and accepting a contract to produce an animated rock video for the band Gibraltar. A work print of the 5-minute film "King's Elevator" premiered at the [[39th World Science Fiction Convention]] in Denver, and subsequently the finished video aired on the nationally syndicated TV series "America Rocks."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artie.com/business/screencredits.htm Artie Romero's screen credits and awards]. Accessed May 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The studio then began producing animated television and theatrical commercials under contract.

In 1983 the studio produced titles and animation for Frameline Filmworks' ''Lost'' starring [[Sandra Dee]] and [[Jack Elam]], and 1984, Romero produced and directed a TV series about video games called ''Video Game All Stars'' for the local NBC affiliate, KOAA Channels 5/30. The program included animated bumpers by Romero. Also in 1984, Romero produced title animation and animated bumpers for ''Almost Live'', produced and hosted by [[Jeff Valdez]]. Everyman Studios continued to produce animation for TV commercials, movie title sequences and software throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, converting from film to digital animation production in 1991.

===ARG! Cartoon Animation===

In 1994 Romero rebranded Everyman Studios as ARG! Cartoon Animation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artieromero.com/comics_and_animation.html Artie Romero's personal site, ''My life, work and passion'', comics and animation]&lt;/ref&gt; in Colorado Springs, producing animation for Duracell's national sales meeting and digital effects for Sony Pictures' ''Johnny Mnemonic''. Romero launched the artie.com website in 1996, and it quickly became one of the most popular animation sites on the Web. The ARG! site got 1 billion hits in a 20-month period in 2005-2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artie.com/allstats.html Artie.com traffic report] Accessed June 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Best known for his visual effects on Keanu Reeves' 1995 cyberpunk feature [[Johnny Mnemonic]], Romero has served as ARG! producer, director and animator on movie projects, TV series, music videos and thousands of animated shorts and commercials. His directorial credits include productions for MTV Networks, PBS, Kaiser Permanente, Harper Collins, AT&amp;T, Transamerica, Safeco Insurance and more than 600 other companies.

In addition to its commercial work, the studio recently produced a series of short whiteboard/Flash cartoons, ''Edward Lear's Nonsense Stories'' for YouTube and cable TV. Since January, 2015, the studio has produced storyboards and 4K animation for TAYEKENI Productions' ''Adventures of Turtle Taido,'' a children's television series that is broadcast on [[Nigerian Television Authority]] stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artie.com/new.htm ARG! Studio News on official studio website] Accessed March 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The program was nominated for Best Animation at the 2015 Abuja Film Festival, and was screened at [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://animationdayincannes.com/who-s-who-in-cannes-for-animation/ Who's Who in Cannes for Animation] Accessed June 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
