'''Pierre Culliford''' ({{IPA-fr|kylifɔʁ|lang}}; 25 June 1928&amp;nbsp;– 24 December 1992) was a Belgian cartoonist who worked under the pseudonym '''Peyo''' ({{IPA-fr|pejo|}}).  His best-known works are the comic strips ''[[The Smurfs]]'' and ''[[Johan and Peewit]]'', in which the Smurfs first appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Pierre Culliford; Created the Widely Popular Smurfs |publisher= LA Times|date=25 December 1992|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-25/news/mn-2392_1_pierre-culliford|accessdate=2010-08-24 | first=Burt A. | last=Folkart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After working briefly at a Belgian animation studio, Peyo began making comic strips for daily newspapers such as ''[[Le Soir]]'' shortly after World War&amp;nbsp;II.  At the beginning of the 1950s, he brought his character Johan to the magazine ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'', whom he soon gave a companion, the diminutive Peewit; the strip soon became a staple of the weeklies.  Peyo introduced the Smurfs in the ''Johan and Peewit'' storyline ''The Magic Flute'' in 1958; the characters quickly supplanted Johan and Peewit in popularity and left them behind for their own series.

In 1960 Peyo founded a studio to accommodate his assistants such as François Walthéry, Gos, and Marc Wasterlain and created the series ''[[Steven Strong]]'' and ''[[Jacky and Célestin]]''.  Peyo's output diminished in the 1970s, at first due to the time he invested in the film ''[[The Smurfs and the Magic Flute]]'' (1976); in the 1980s he put in more time, despite recurring health problems, into an American adaptation of ''The Smurfs'' as [[The Smurfs (TV series)|an animated television series]].  After the series concluded he left his publisher [[Dupuis]] to found his own publishing house, Cartoon Creation, and a cartoon magazine, ''Schtroumpf!'', which soon folded due to management problems.  He joined [[Le Lombard]] in 1992 but died a few months later.  Since his death, Peyo's children have continued to promote his work under the brand "Peyo".

==Personal life==
Peyo was born in 1928 in the Belgian municipality [[Schaerbeek]], as the son of an [[English people|English]] father and a Belgian mother.&lt;ref name=Weyer&gt;De Weyer, Geert (2005). "Peyo". In België gestript, pp. 148-149. Tielt: Lannoo.&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Christmas Eve]] 1992, Peyo died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in Brussels at age 64.

==Career==
He took on the name "Peyo" early in his professional career, based on an [[England|English]] cousin's mispronunciation of Pierrot (a diminutive form of [[Pierre]]).

Peyo began work, fresh from his coursework at the [[Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts]] in Brussels, at the [[Compagnie Belge d'Animation]] (CBA), a small Belgian animation studio, where he met a few of his future colleagues and co-celebrities, like [[André Franquin]], [[Morris (comics)|Morris]], and [[Eddy Paape]]. When the studio folded after the war, the other artists went to work for [[Dupuis]], but Peyo, a few years younger than the others, was not accepted.&lt;ref name=Weyer/&gt; He made his first comics for the newspaper ''[[La Dernière Heure]]'' (The Latest Hour), but also accepted many promotional drawing jobs for income. From 1949 to 1952, he drew ''[[Poussy]]'', a stop comic about a cat, for ''[[Le Soir]]''. For the same newspaper, he also created ''Johan''.

In 1952, Franquin introduced Peyo to ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'', a children's [[Franco-Belgian comics]] magazine published by [[Dupuis]].&lt;ref name=Weyer/&gt; Peyo wrote and drew a number of characters and storylines, including ''Pierrot'', and ''Benoît Brisefer'' (translated into English as ''[[Steven Strong]]''). But his favourite was ''Johan et Pirlouit'' (translated into English as ''[[Johan and Peewit]]''), which was a continuation of the series ''Johan'' he had created earlier. He also continued ''Poussy'' in ''Spirou''.

Set in the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]], ''Johan et Pirlouit'' stars a brave young [[Page (occupation)|page]] to the king, and his faithful, if boastful and cheating, midget [[sidekick]]. Johan rides off to defend the meek on his trusty horse, while Peewit gallops sporadically behind on his goat, named Biquette. The pair was driven by duty to their king and the courage to defend the underpowered. Peewit only appeared in the third adventure in 1954 but would stay for all later adventures.

===Smurfs===
The first Smurf appeared in ''[[Johan and Peewit]]'' on 23 October 1958 in the album ''La Flûte à Six Schtroumpfs'' (''The Six Smurfed Flute''). As the Smurfs became increasingly popular, Peyo started a studio in the early 1960s, where a number of talented [[comics artist]]s started to work. Peyo himself supervised the work and worked primarily on ''Johan and Peewit'', leaving the Smurfs to the studio. The most notable artists to come out of this studio were [[François Walthéry|Walthéry]], [[Marc Wasterlain]], [[Roland Goossens|Gos]], [[Claude de Ribaupierre|Derib]], [[Lucien De Gieter]], and [[Daniel Desorgher]].

In 1959, the Smurfs got their own [[The Smurfs (comics)|series]], and in 1960, two more began: ''[[Steven Strong]]'' and ''Jacky and Célestin''. Many authors of the [[Marcinelle school]] collaborated on the writing, or on the artwork, including [[Will (comics)|Willy Maltaite]] (aka 'Will'), [[Yvan Delporte]], and [[Roger Leloup]]. Peyo became more of a businessman and supervisor and was less involved in the actual creation of the comics. He let his son, Thierry Culliford, lead the studio, while his daughter Véronique was responsible for the merchandising (I.M.P.S. was established in 1985 by her).&lt;ref name=Weyer/&gt;

The [[The Smurfs (merchandising)|merchandising of the Smurfs]] began in 1959, with the PVC figurines as the most important aspect until the late 1970s. Then, with the success of [[The Smurfs (music)|The Smurfs]] records by [[Pierre Kartner]], the Smurfs achieved more international success, with a new boom in toys and gadgets. Some of these reached the [[United States]], where [[Hanna-Barbera]] created a [[The Smurfs (TV series)|Saturday morning animated series]] in 1981 for which Peyo served as story supervisor. Peyo's health began to fail. In 1989, after his partnership with Dupuis ended, he established Cartoon Creation to publish new Smurf stories. In late 1991, the company was forced to shut down due to mismanagement. The publishing rights were soon sold to Le Lombard. Peyo died at age 64, on [[Christmas Eve]] 1992, of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in Brussels. His studio still exists, and new stories for various series are regularly produced under his name.

In the 2011 film ''[[The Smurfs (film)|The Smurfs]]'', Peyo was included in the plot as a researcher who studied the myths concerning the Smurfs, who were made to be real-life legendary creatures in the film's storyline.
