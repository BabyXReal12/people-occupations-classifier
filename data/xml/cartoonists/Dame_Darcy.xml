== Biography ==
Dame Darcy acquired her initial skill set while still a child and teen working as an apprentice to her father in his sign painting studio, Green Tree Graphics. She began her own career at age 17 when she won a scholarship to the [[San Francisco Art Institute]].&lt;ref name="TCJ171" /&gt; During this time, she acted in films by [[George Kuchar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/darcy_d.htm|title= Dame Darcy|date= December 13, 2006|publisher= [[Lambiek|Lambiek Comiclopedia]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205523/https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/darcy_d.htm|archivedate= December 20, 2016|deadurl= no|quote= Darcy seriously began pursuing a life in art when she won a scholarship to the San Francisco Art Institute in 1989. She majored in film and studied animation...At the same time, she pursued a career as an actress with parts in local independent films by director George Kuchar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She made her first publishing deal at the age of 21 when her comic book series ''[[Meat Cake]]'' was picked up by Fantagraphics Books.&lt;ref name="TCJ171" /&gt; She originally considered using the [[pen name]] "Richard Dirt" but her father suggested adding a title to her own first name instead, so Darcy used the name Richard Dirt as a character in her comic book. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://observer.com/2016/08/let-us-play-comics-artist-dame-darcy-on-her-mindblowing-meat-cake-bible/|title= Let Us Play: Comics Artist Dame Darcy on Her Mind-Blowing ''Meat Cake Bible''|first= Sean T.|last= Collins|date= August 11, 2016|work= [[New York Observer]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160813210615/http://observer.com/2016/08/let-us-play-comics-artist-dame-darcy-on-her-mindblowing-meat-cake-bible/|archivedate= August 13, 2016|deadurl= no|quote= When I first started self-publishing comics I wanted to experiment with having my pen name be Richard Dirt...My Dad advised against it, saying that if I add a title to my first name, like Queen Latifah or Dr. Seuss, I would not have to deal with the hassle of actually changing my last name. I came up with Dame because it is alliterative with my first name and is a ladies’ title.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She performed for a time with [[Lisa Crystal Carver]] and [[Jean-Louis Costes]]'s underground cabaret [[Suckdog|Suckdog Circus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Calhoun|first= Ada|title= Prophet for Our Times|journal=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date= August 11, 2000|location= Austin, Texas|url= http://www.austinchronicle.com/arts/2000-08-11/78153/|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161219233406/http://www.austinchronicle.com/arts/2000-08-11/78153/|archivedate= December 19, 2016|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
