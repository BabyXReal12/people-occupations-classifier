==Education==
Fincher received his bachelor's degree from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1968, and he was a Distinguished Military Graduate of [[St. Mary's University School of Law]], where he received his [[Juris Doctor|juris doctor]] in 1971.

==Career==
He was admitted to the [[State Bar of Texas]] in 1971 and admitted to practice before the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. District Court, [[Southern District of Texas]]. He has practiced law ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texasbar.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Advanced_Search&amp;template=/Customsource/MemberDirectory/MemberDirectoryDetail.cfm&amp;ContactID=167481 State Bar of Texas lawyer listing]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Fincher began publishing his law-related comics and strips. During 1987 he began his long-running Texas-themed political newspaper comic strip, Thadeus &amp; Weez, which ran in 19 Texas newspapers before being retired in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thadeusandweez.com Thadeus &amp; Weez]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2005, he won the “Best Web Cartoons” in the "People's Pick" category from About.com for The Illustrated Daily Scribble.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2005/12/31/aboutcom-award-winners-include-garry-trudeau-tom-tomorrow/ ''The Daily Cartoonist'', "Section Awards," Dec. 31, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides Texas newspapers, his editorial cartoons have appeared in the [[Arizona Daily Star]] and the [[Boston Herald]], and his work has been reprinted in textbooks and legal journals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baylor.edu/lib/poage/bullock/index.php?id=55849 Baylor University, Collection of Political Materials, cartoon collections]&lt;/ref&gt;

For five years, Fincher's monthly lawyer strip "Fenwilder &amp; Jones" ran in the [[ABA Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://legalblogwatch.typepad.com/legal_blog_watch/2006/02/new_cartoon_bla.html Law.com, "New cartoon blawg," February 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/abaj65&amp;div=190&amp;id=&amp;page= HeinOnline, ABA Journal, 1979, with Charles Fincher editorial cartoon]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fincher ended his long-running political comic strip, "The Illustrated Daily Scribble," in 2006, because, he was quoted as saying, "The Bush administration is hard to satirize."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2006/03/23/illustrated-daily-scribble-comes-to-a-close/ ''The Daily Cartoonist'' article, "Illustrated Daily Scribble Comes to a Close," March 23, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Then, a year later, he resumed "Scribble" and launched two new strips, "Scribble-in-Law" and "Scribble Beach".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4694744-1.html ''Editor &amp; Publisher'', "Cartoonist Resumes One 'Scribble' and Starts Two Others," Feb. 6, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; His most recent cartoon characters include Bitcher &amp; Prickman, comic law partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenlaw.com/Christopher-Green-LL.B/some-lawyers-are-stand-up-cartoons Greenlaw.com, "Some lawyers are stand-up cartoons," Aug. 1, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the founder of LawComix, a cartoon site for lawyers. And he is the creator of "Legal Isms," 10  comic strips about lawyers, contracted by [[LexisNexis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theallisonlawfirm.com/HTMLpages/Charles.html Allison law firm biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Fincher was commissioned by the ABA’s Council of Appellate Staff Attorneys (CASA) to paint a fantasy illustration of Constitutional law professor [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] as a shortstop with the [[Chicago Cubs]], the scholar's favorite team. The painting was presented to Chemerinsky at a conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://texaslawyer.typepad.com/texas_lawyer_blog/2008/11/lawyer-paints-portrait-of-con-law-legend.html ''Texas Lawyer'', "Lawyer paints portrait of Con Law legend," November 18, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fincher practices at The Allison Law Firm, a private firm that specializes in serious injury and wrongful death lawsuits,&lt;ref&gt;[http://theallisonlawfirm.com/HTMLpages/Attorneys.html The Allison Law Firm, list of lawyers]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[South Padre Island, Texas]].
