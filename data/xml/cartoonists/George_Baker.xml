'''George Baker''' (May 22, 1915 â€“ May 7, 1975) was a [[cartoonist]] who became prominent during [[World War II]] as the creator of the popular comic strip, ''[[Sad Sack|The Sad Sack]]''.

The 1957 comedy film ''[[The Sad Sack]]'' starring [[Jerry Lewis]] was based on Baker's fictional character.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Baker was born in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], living there until 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcj.com/george-baker-and-the-sad-sack/]&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Rock Island, Illinois]] and [[Chicago]]. In Chicago, he attended [[Lane Technical College Prep High School|Lane Tech High School]] and graduated from [[Roosevelt High School (Chicago, Illinois)|Roosevelt High]], where he played baseball and drew pictures for the high school annual.

===Commercial artist===
After six weeks of art training in a night school, he got a job as a commercial artist "but soon grew tired of drawing pots and pans for newspaper advertisements."&lt;ref&gt;''Current Biography 1944'', pp. 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disney days===
He moved to California to pursue a baseball career. Instead, he was hired by [[Walt Disney]] in 1937, and assisted in the production of the studio's full-length animated features, including ''Pinocchio'', ''Fantasia'', ''Dumbo'' and ''Bambi''. His specialty was animation of thunderstorms, waterfalls and other effects.&lt;ref name="Id. at 28"&gt;Id. at 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
Five months prior to Pearl Harbor, Baker was drafted (June 1941) into the United States Army. He related later that he expected that the Army Classification System would have no use for his artistic experience, noting "They say it makes cooks out of mechanics, and vice versa. But I must say, it worked perfectly in my case."&lt;ref name="Id. at 28"/&gt; To his surprise, he was assigned to [[Fort Monmouth]] for basic training and to create animation for [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] training films.

Baker won a cartoon contest, sponsored by the "Defense Recreation Committee", and received a portable typewriter as first prize. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine printed some of his submissions, and he was hired by ''[[Yank, the Army Weekly]]'', where he adapted his drawings of the misadventures of an army recruit into ''[[The Sad Sack]]''. Drawn in pantomime, the strip became the magazine's most popular feature, as measured by the fan mail from servicemen who identified with the luckless private. In an official document, General [[George C. Marshall]] praised ''Sad Sack'' as a morale-booster for World War II troops.{{Citation needed|date= July 2012}}

===Civilian life===
At the end of the war, the U.S. Army created an advertising campaign with the phrase: "Don't be a Sad Sack, re-enlist in the Regular Army". Discharged from military service, Baker returned to live in [[Los Angeles]] where he transformed the ''Sad Sack'' army cartoon into a syndicated [[comic strip]] and a [[comic book]] series aimed at younger readers.

While Baker gave the job of writing the comic narrative to others, he continued to illustrate the ''Sad Sack'' comic book covers until the time of his death. The ''Sad Sack'' [[radio program]] was broadcast in 1946.

===Death and burial===
George Baker is buried at [[Riverside National Cemetery]], [[Riverside, California]].
