==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Kyle Baker was born in the [[Queens]], [[New York City]],&lt;ref name=nolenp6&gt;Nolen-Weathington, Eric. ''Modern Masters Volume 20: Kyle Baker'' ([[TwoMorrows Publishing]], 2008), p. 6. {{ISBN|1-60549-008-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of [[art director]] John M. Baker and high-school audiovisual-department manager Eleanor L. Baker.&lt;ref name=nytweddings&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/19/style/weddings-elizabeth-glass-and-kyle-baker.html |title=Weddings: Elizabeth Glass and Kyle Baker |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 19, 1998 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGtIvzN5?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/19/style/weddings-elizabeth-glass-and-kyle-baker.html |archivedate=November 16, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a brother and a sister.&lt;ref name=nolenp6 /&gt; Their parents had both attended [[Pratt Institute]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and their father, who, Baker said, "worked in advertising [and] made junk mail", would "draw pictures for us and entertain us."&lt;ref name=nolenp6 /&gt; Aside from this exposure to art, Baker has said, his early artistic influences included [[comic book]] artist [[Jack Kirby]], [[caricature|caricaturist]] [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]], and painter and magazine illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]]. He noted:
{{quote|When I was a little boy I loved the [[comic strips|funny papers]]. ... I used to read ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'', ''[[Li'l Abner]]'', ''[[Peanuts]]'', ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]'' and ''[[B.C. (comic strip)|B.C.]]'' among others. I loved to draw [[Johnny Hart]]'s ''B.C.'' characters and the [[Muppets]]. I made up my own cartoon characters and drew stories about them. I loved ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine. I had paperback reprints of the early [[Harvey Kurtzman|[Harvey] Kurtzman]] stories, illustrated by [[Wally Wood]], [[Will Elder]], and Jack Davis. I loved [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney movies]]. ... I would come home from the movies and practice drawing the characters. I drew little animated [[flip book]]s on [[index cards]]. When I was 11, I had a [[Super-8]] movie camera and I made animated cartoons. I remember making a '[[King Kong]]' out of clay, and a drawing of a New York skyline, and I made a stop-motion film of King-Kong fighting model airplanes. In junior high school, I drew comic books and [[Xerox]]ed them at my dad's office. I sold the Xeroxes for five cents each. I think I made fifteen cents.&lt;ref name=jitterburg2&gt;{{cite web |last=Brennan |first=Kristen |url=http://moongadget.com/baker/index.html |title='I Make People Laugh' |work=Jitterbug Fantasia |publisher=Moongadget.com |date=1999 |page=[http://moongadget.com/baker/kylebaker2.html 2] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uEk5oKYr?url=http://moongadget.com/baker/index.html |archivedate=November 14, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other influences included the [[Charlton Comics]] artwork of [[Jim Aparo]] and [[Steve Ditko]].&lt;ref name=nolenp6 /&gt;

===Breaking into comics===
In his senior year of [[high school]], Baker became an intern at [[Marvel Comics]], making photocopies and filing fan mail.&lt;ref name=jitterburg2 /&gt; "I sort of fell into Marvel because I happened to know somebody there," he said. "But I always thought I was going to do funny stuff" rather than [[superhero]] comics.&lt;ref name=nolenp6 /&gt; He became background assistant to Marvel [[inker]] [[Josef Rubinstein]], and later also assisted [[Vince Colletta]] and [[Andy Mushynski]].&lt;ref name=jitterburg2 /&gt; He cited Marvel artists [[Walt Simonson]], [[Al Milgrom]] and [[Larry Hama]] and writer and editor-in-chief [[Jim Shooter]] as providing him art and storytelling advice.&lt;ref name=nolen9&gt;Nolen-Weathington, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Part of his duties involved [[photocopying]], and he would take copies of [[John Buscema]] [[penciler|penciling]] home on which to practice [[inker|inking]].&lt;ref name=nolen9 /&gt; While working for Marvel, Baker attended the [[School of Visual Arts]], in [[Manhattan]], studying [[graphic design]] and [[printmaking]],&lt;ref name=nolen11&gt;Nolen-Weathington, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; but dropped out after two years.&lt;ref name=jitterburg2 /&gt; Through that connection, however, he began freelancing with famed graphic designer [[Milton Glaser]], an SVA instructor, assisting him on a set of [[children's literature|children's books]].&lt;ref name=nolen11 /&gt;

Baker's first credited work at Marvel is [[penciler|penciling]] the half-page entry "[[Kid Commandos]]" in ''[[The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' #13 (February1984).&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;{{gcdb|type=credit|search=Kyle+Baker|title=Kyle Baker}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a handful of inking assignments on issues of ''[[Transformers]]'', ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers Annual]]'' #14 (1985) and elsewhere, Baker made his professional story-illustration debut as penciler and inker of the publisher Lodestone Comics' ''Codename: Danger'' #2 (October 1985), with a 23-page story written by Brian Marshall, [[Mike Harris (comics)|Mike Harris]], and [[Robert Loren Fleming]]. Cover penciling and more interior inking for Marvel and occasionally DC followed. His first story penciling for one of the two major comics companies was the three-issue ''[[Howard The Duck]]: The Movie'' (December 1986 - February 1987), adapting the 1986 film ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]'', and which he self-inked.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

During this time, Baker also attempted to sell humor spot illustrations, but was rejected by the major [[newspaper]] [[print syndication|syndicates]]. [[Jim Salicrup]], a Marvel editor, did commission him "to write a few one-panel gags about [the superhero team] the [[X-Men]]",&lt;ref name=jitterburg2 /&gt; titled "It's Genetic" and appearing in the Marvel-produced fan magazine ''[[Marvel Age]]''.&lt;ref name=nolen106-107&gt;Nolen-Weathington, pp. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt;

===First graphic novel===
At the recommendation of freelance artist [[Ron Fontes]], an editor at the Dolphin [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of the publishing house [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] expressed interest in Baker's sample strips of the character Cowboy Wally, "and asked if I had any more. I lied and said I did."&lt;ref name=jitterburg2 /&gt; This led to the 128-page [[graphic novel]] ''Cowboy Wally''.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; "The character of Noel was pretty much based on me," Baker said in 1999. "I lie all the time.&lt;ref name=solinas /&gt; The first part of the books is the collected strips, and the other three chapters were written for the book.&lt;ref name=jitterburg2 /&gt; "It didn't sell many copies," Baker said, "but at least it convinced [[DC Comics|DC [Comics]]] I should be allowed to draw, not just ink."&lt;ref name=jitterburg2 /&gt;

Baker went on to draw DC's 1980s comics revival of the [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] hero ''[[The Shadow]]'', beginning with ''The Shadow Annual'' #2 (1988), followed by the monthly series from issue #7 to the final issue, #19 (February 1988 - January 1989). He did assorted other DC work including ''[[Justice, Inc. (comics)|Justice, Inc.]]'' In 1990, Baker and writer [[Len Wein]] produced three issues of ''[[Dick Tracy]]'' for [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s [[Hollywood Comics]], the first two issues containing original stories, the third an adaption the 1990 ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/4179/ ''Dick Tracy'' (Disney, Hollywood Comics, Walt Disney Publications, Inc. imprint, 1990 Series)] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt;

He began scripting comics around this time: Baker penciled and inked [[First Comics]]' ''[[Classics Illustrated]]'' #3 &amp; 21 (February 1990 &amp; March 1991), adapting, respectively, ''[[Through the Looking Glass]]'' and ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]''. While [[Peter David]] scripted the latter, Baker himself wrote the adaptation of the [[Lewis Carroll]] work.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; "I'd never planned to become a writer," Baker said in 1999. "I wrote short gags, like the kind you see in the newspapers and Cowboy Wally, but not stories. I only learned to write stories because people kept paying me to write them. In the years 1991-1994, 90 percent of my income was from writing, and I received very few offers to draw. I figured I should learn to write."&lt;ref name=jitterburg2 /&gt;

===''Why I Hate Saturn'', commercial illustration===
[[File:WhyIHateSaturn.jpg|upright|thumb|Baker's ''Why I Hate Saturn'', 1998 reprint edition]]
Baker achieved recognition and won an [[Eisner Award]] for his 1990 graphic novel ''Why I Hate Saturn'', published by the DC Comics [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] [[Piranha Press]]. Baker said in 1999 of his breakthrough work,
{{quote|I wrote ''Why I Hate Saturn'' at a time when comic books had stopped being fun for me. I was tired of being told how to draw and what to draw. And I was sick of begging people to let me work the way I wanted. Editors told me my stuff was 'underground' and 'alternative'. I decided that if I were going to work in a creatively oppressive atmosphere and not even be allowed to own my work, I might as well go to [[Hollywood]] and be oppressed for big money. Back in the eighties, [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] wouldn't let you own your characters, and [[Fantagraphics]] had no money. So when I finally got permission to do ''Why I Hate Saturn'', a book I'd been trying years to sell, I decided to write it like a sitcom and send it to Hollywood. ... [However,] I don't have anything to do with the [then-proposed] ''Why I Hate Saturn'' movie. DC controls those rights. I don't own those characters, so it is of no interest to me.&lt;ref name=jitterburg2/&gt;}}

Baker's cartoons and [[caricatures]] began appearing in ''[[BusinessWeek]], [[Details (magazine)|Details]], [[Entertainment Weekly]], [[ESPN]], [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]], [[Guitar World]], [[Mad (magazine)|Mad]], [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]], [[New York (magazine)|New York]], [[The New York Times]], [[Rolling Stone]], [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]], [[Us (magazine)|Us]], [[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'', and ''[[The Village Voice]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} He spent three years illustrating the weekly strip "Bad Publicity" for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=lam/&gt;

===Animation===
Baker's animation has appeared on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] and [[MTV]], and in animated ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' projects, including the animated feature ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Baker was "guest art director" for Cartoon Network's ''[[Class of 3000]]'', and [[storyboard]]ed the ''Class of 3000'' Christmas special.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

in 1994, Baker directed an animated video featuring the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] singer [[KRS-One]]&lt;!--spelling per http://www.krs-one.com/--&gt;, called "Break The Chain".{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Marvel Comics had published ''Break the Chain'' as a comic book packaged with a read-along [[hip-hop]] [[audiocassette]].&lt;ref name=solinas /&gt; That same year and next, he contributed to the four-issue [[Dark Horse Comics]] humor anthology ''Instant Piano'' (December 1994 - June 1995), including drawing the cover of the premiere.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; For another anthology, DC's ''[[Elseworlds]] 80-Page Giant'' #1 (August 1999), Baker drew, [[colorist|colored]], [[letterer|lettered]] and with his wife, teacher Elizabeth Glass, whom he married July 18, 1998,&lt;ref name=nytweddings /&gt; wrote the 10-page [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] story "[[Letitia Lerner, Superman's Babysitter]]". It would win a "Best Short Story" [[Eisner Award]] despite DC destroying all copies intended for the [[North American]] market after deeming some of the content unsuitable, though copies were still distributed in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/62860/ ''Elseworlds 80-Page Giant'' #1 (August 1999)] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker said in 1999 he was writing a [[Christmas movie]] for [[Paramount Pictures]], titled ''U Betta Watch Out'', and was animating a [[TV-movie]] title ''Corey Q. Jeeters, I'm Telling on You''.&lt;ref name=jitterburg2 /&gt;

At this point in his career, Baker stated in an interview, "Nobody tells me what to write or how to draw. Only an idiot would dare tell Kyle Baker how to make a good cartoon. Hollywood and the magazine world are full of idiots. They water my stuff down and make it unfunny."&lt;ref name=solinas&gt;{{cite web |first=Solinas |last=Antonio |url=http://www.ultrazine.org/ultraparole/baker_english.htm |title=A Kyle Baker Interview |work=Ultrazine |date=December 2000 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uEnMEZLu?url=http://www.ultrazine.org/ultraparole/baker_english.htm |archivedate=November 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }} English-language version of interview from Italian webmagzine ''Rorscharch''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is credited with writing and storyboarding on the "Phineas and Ferb" television episodes "Candace Loses Her Head" and "Are You My Mummy?".{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===2000s===
Baker drew writer [[Robert Morales]]' Marvel Comics  miniseries ''[[Truth: Red, White &amp; Black|Truth]]'' #1-7 (January–July 2003), a [[Captain America]] storyline with parallels to the [[Tuskegee experiment]]. He also wrote and drew all but two issues (#7 and #12) of the 20-issue comedic adventure series ''[[Plastic Man]]'' vol. 4 (February 2004 - March 2006), starring the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] [[superhero]] created by [[Jack Cole (artist)|Jack Cole]] for [[Quality Comics]]. Baker contributed to the [[Dark Horse Comics]] series ''[[The Escapist (character)|The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist]]'', a spin-off of [[Michael Chabon]]'s novel, ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay]]''.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

In 2006, his company, Kyle Baker Publishing, serialized a four-part comic book series about [[Nat Turner]], and published the series ''The Bakers'', based on his family life, in two anthologies, ''Cartoonist'' and ''Cartoonist Vol. 2: Now with More Bakers''. He has also continued to provide comics material sporadically to Marvel, DC and [[Image Comics]] through at least 2010.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; In 2007 and 2008, [[Image Comics]] published Baker's six-issue [[Image Comics]] miniseries ''Special Forces'', a teen-soldier military [[satire]] that criticizes the exhortation of felons and disabled Americans into military service.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sullivan |first=Michael Patrick |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10805 |title=Kyle Baker Deploys His 'Special Forces |publisher=[[ComicBookResources.com]] |date=July 17, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGvCxfX6?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page%3Darticle%26id%3D10805 |archivedate=November 16, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewed the 2009 [[trade-paperback]] collection of the first four issues, calling it "the harshest, most serrated satire of the [[Iraq War]] yet published."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolk|first=Douglas|title=Holiday Books: Comics|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= December 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Watson-Guptill published ''How to Draw Stupid and Other Essentials of Cartooning'', Baker's art instruction book. That same year, Baker hosted the comics industry's [[Harvey Award]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Callan |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=18247 |title=2008 Harvey Award Winners |publisher=ComicBookResources |date=September 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGozKwvq?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page%3Darticle%26id%3D18247 |archivedate=November 16, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he became regular artist on [[Marvel Comic]]' mature-audience [[MAX (comics)|MAX]]-[[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] series, ''[[Deadpool|Deadpool Max]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
