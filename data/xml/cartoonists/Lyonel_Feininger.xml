'''Lyonel Charles Feininger''' (July 17, 1871{{spaced ndash}}January 13, 1956) was a [[German-American]] [[painters|painter]], and a leading exponent of [[Expressionism]]. He also worked as a [[caricature|caricaturist]] and [[comic strip]] artist. He was born and grew up in New York City, traveling to Germany at 16 to study and perfect his art. He started his career as a cartoonist in 1894 and met with much success in this area. He was also a commercial caricaturist for 20 years for magazines and newspapers in the USA and Germany. At the age of 36, he started to work as a fine artist. He also produced a large body of photographic works between 1928 and the mid 1950s, but he kept these primarily within his circle of friends. He was also a pianist and composer, with several piano compositions and fugues for organ extant.

Lyonel Feininger was born to German-American violinist and composer [[Karl Feininger]] and American singer Elizabeth Feininger.&lt;ref name=aaabio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/alfred-vance-churchill-papers-regarding-lyonel-feininger-9000/more#biohist|title=Alfred Vance Churchill papers regarding Lyonel Feininger, 1888-1944|work=Archive of American Art Finding Aids|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born and grew up in [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/artist/674148/lyonel-feininger.html]"Lyonel Feininger (Léonell Charles Feininger) is born in New York City on July 17th. He was the first child of the violinist Karl Feininger from Durlach in Baden (South West Germany) and the American singer Elizabeth Cecilia Feininger, born Lutz, who was also of German descent. "&lt;/ref&gt; but traveled to Germany at the age of 16 in 1887&lt;ref name=coop&gt;Cooper, Philip. ''Cubism''. London: Phaidon, 1995, p. 90. {{ISBN|0714832502}}&lt;/ref&gt; to study. In 1888, he moved to Berlin and studied at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Königliche Akademie Berlin]] under [[Ernst Hancke]]. He continued his studies at art schools in Berlin with [[Karl Schlabitz]], and in Paris with sculptor [[Filippo Colarossi]]. He started as a caricaturist for several magazines including ''[[Harper's Round Table]]'', ''[[Harper's Young People]]'', ''Humoristische Blätter'', ''Lustige Blätter'', ''[[Das Narrenschiff (magazine)|Das Narrenschiff]]'', ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'' and ''[[Ulk]]''.

In 1900, he met Clara Fürst, daughter of the painter [[Gustav Fürst]]. He married her in 1901, and they had two daughters. In 1905, he separated from his wife after meeting Julia Berg. He married Berg in 1908 and the couple had three boys.

The artist was represented with drawings at the exhibitions of the annual [[Berlin Secession]] in the years 1901 through 1903.

Feininger's career as cartoonist started in 1894. He was working for several German, French and American magazines. In February 1906, when a quarter of Chicago's population was of German descent, [[James Keeley]], editor of The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' traveled to Germany to procure the services of the most popular humor artists. He recruited Feininger to illustrate two comic strips "[[The Kin-der-Kids]]" and "[[Wee Willie Winkie's World]]" for the ''Chicago Tribune''.&lt;ref name=aaabio/&gt;&lt;ref name=osu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoons.osu.edu/digital_albums/lyonelfeininger/feininger.html|title=Lyonel Feininger|work=Cartoons|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strips were noted for their [[wikt:fey|fey]] humor and graphic experimentation. He also worked as a commercial caricaturist for 20 years for various newspapers and magazines in both the [[United States]] and [[Germany]]. Later, [[Art Spiegelman]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]],'' that Feininger's comics have “achieved a breathtaking formal grace unsurpassed in the history of the medium.”&lt;ref name=osu/&gt;

Feininger started working as a fine artist at the age of 36. He was a member of the ''Berliner Sezession'' in 1909, and he was associated with German expressionist groups: [[Die Brücke]], the [[Novembergruppe]], [[Gruppe 1919]], the [[Blaue Reiter]] circle and [[Die Blaue Vier]] (The Blue Four). His first solo exhibit was at [[Sturm Gallery]] in Berlin, 1917.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; When [[Walter Gropius]] founded the [[Bauhaus]] in Germany in 1919, Feininger was his first faculty appointment, and became the master artist in charge of the printmaking workshop.&lt;ref name=aaabio/&gt;&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Muir, Laura and Nathan Timpano. Lyonel Feininger: Photographs 1928-1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benz-Feininger-090626-008.JPG|thumb|Feininger Tour marker in Benz, [[Usedom]] Island, Germany]]
From 1909 until 1921, Feininger spent summer vacations on the island of [[Usedom]] to recover and to get new inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papileo.de/ www.papileo.de]&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to create paintings and drawings of [[Benz (Usedom)|Benz]] for the rest of his life, even after returning to live in the United States. A tour of the sites appearing in the works of Feininger follows a path with markers in the ground to guide visitors.

He designed the cover for the Bauhaus 1919 manifesto: an expressionist [[woodcut]] 'cathedral'. He taught at the Bauhaus for several years. Among the students who attended his workshops were [[Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack]] (German/Australian (1893–1965), [[Hans Friedrich Grohs]] (German 1892 - 1981), and [[Margarete Koehler-Bittkow]] (German/American, 1898–1964).

When the [[Nazi Party]] came to power in 1933, the situation became unbearable for Feininger and his wife. The Nazi Party declared his work to be "degenerate."&lt;ref name=aaabio/&gt; They moved to America after his work was exhibited in the '[[degenerate art]]' (''Entartete Kunst'') in 1936, but before the 1937 exhibition in [[Munich]]. He taught at [[Mills College]] before returning to New York.&lt;ref name=aaabio /&gt; He was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] in 1955.&lt;ref name=AAAL&gt;{{cite web|title=Deceased Members |url=http://www.artsandletters.org/academicians2_deceased.php |work=American Academy of Arts and Letters |accessdate=July 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726004624/http://www.artsandletters.org/academicians2_deceased.php |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to drawing, Feininger created art with painted toy figures being photographed in front of drawn backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=36–76|title=Lyonel Feininger: City at the Edge of the World|first=T. Lux|last=Feininger|publisher=Frederick A. Praeger|year=1965|lccn=65-25280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feininger produced a large body of photographic works between 1928 and the mid-1950s. He kept his photographic work within his circle of friends, and it was not shared with the public in his lifetime. He gave some prints away to his colleagues [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.]].&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

Feininger also had intermittent activity as a pianist and composer, with several piano compositions and fugues for organ extant.

His sons, [[Andreas Feininger]] and [[T. Lux Feininger]], both became noted artists, the former as a photographer and the latter as a photographer and painter. T. Lux Feininger died July 7, 2011 at the age of 101.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/arts/t-lux-feininger-photographer-and-painter-dies-at-101.html NY Times Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major retrospective==

A major retrospective exhibition of Lyonel Feininger's work, initially at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] during June 30 October 16, 2011, was subsequently due to run at the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] during January 20–May 13, 2012. The exhibition is described as "the first in Feininger’s native country in more than forty-five years, and the first ever to include the full breadth of his art" and as "accompanied by a richly illustrated monograph with a feature essay that provides a broad overview of Feininger’s career..."&lt;ref&gt;"''Lyonel Feininger at the Edge of the World''". Whitney Museum of American Art. Accessed on October 6, 2011 at: http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/LyonelFeininger.&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics have argued that the artist's work was at its most mature around 1910 in works in which the power of Feininger as illustrator balance his abstract side; however, we have to consider the possibility that Feininger used cubism as a more artistically succinct tool to establish his version of the concept known as the objective correlative. In tandem with the Whitney retrospective, the American Symphony Orchestra under Leon Botstein, at Carnegie Hall on 21 October 2011, performed three orchestral fugues written by Feininger. Barbara Haskell, curator of the Whitney exhibit, wrote that for his entire life, Feininger credited Bach with having been his “master in painting.” &lt;ref&gt; http://americansymphony.org/lyonel-feininger/ &lt;/ref&gt;

==Art market==

At a 2001 [[Christie's]] auction in London, Feininger's painting ''The Green Bridge'' (1909) was sold for £2.42 million.&lt;ref&gt;Souren Melikian (June 30, 2001), [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/30/style/30iht-souren_ed2_.html Market Goes Its Own Way With Record Prices] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
