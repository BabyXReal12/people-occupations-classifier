'''Guy Berkeley''' "'''Berke'''" '''Breathed''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɛ|ð|ɪ|d}}; born June 21, 1957) is an American [[cartoonist]], children's book creator, [[Film director|director]] and [[screenwriter]], best known for his [[comic strip]]s ''[[Bloom County]]'', ''[[Outland (comic strip)|Outland]]'', and ''[[Opus (comic strip)|Opus]]''. ''Bloom County'' earned Breathed the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning]] in 1987.

==Early life==
Born in [[Encino, Los Angeles, California|Encino, California]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2005-A-Fi/Breathed-Berkeley.html Encyclopedia of World Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in [[Houston, Texas]], Breathed attended [[Westchester Academy for International Studies|Westchester High School]]&lt;ref name=houston&gt;[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2007_4318027 Berkowitz, Lana, "His latest opus: ''Bloom County'' creator finds a more constructive path writing children's books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522103926/http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2007_4318027 |date=2011-05-22 }}", ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', April 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in Houston.

==Cartooning career==
Breathed was first published when he was hired part-time by the ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'' to draw editorial cartoons for the newspaper. This job was short-lived; he was dismissed shortly after one of his cartoons caused outrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Breathed |first=Berke |title=Classics of Western Literature: Bloom County, 1986-1989 |page=2 |year=1990 |publisher=Little, Brown |isbn=0-316-10754-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first comic strip published regularly was ''[[The Academia Waltz]],'' which appeared in the ''[[Daily Texan]]'', in 1978 while he was a student at [[the University of Texas]]. During his time at the University of Texas, Breathed self-published two collections of ''The Academia Waltz'', using the profits to pay his tuition. The comic strip attracted the notice of the editors of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', who recruited him to do a nationally syndicated strip. On December 8, 1980, ''Bloom County'' made its debut and featured some of the characters from ''Academia Waltz,'' including former frat-boy [[Steve Dallas]] and the [[paraplegic]] [[Vietnam war]] veteran [[Cutter John]]. In the beginning, the strip's style was so similar to that of another popular strip, ''[[Doonesbury]]'', that Doonesbury's creator [[Garry Trudeau]] wrote to Breathed several times to indicate their similarities.&lt;ref name="latimesblog"&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2009/10/berkeley-breathed-drawn-back-to-bloom-county-but-looking-forward.html Ellen, Mary, "Berkeley Breathed, drawn back to 'Bloom County' but looking forward"], ''Los Angeles Times "Hero Complex" blog''. Retrieved 2010-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Breathed has acknowledged that he borrowed liberally from Doonesbury during his early career. In the ''Outland'' collection, ''One Last Little Peek'', Breathed even put an early ''Bloom County'' side-by-side with the ''Doonesbury'' comic strip from which it obviously took its idea.

''Bloom County'' earned Breathed the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for [[editorial cartooning]] during 1987.&lt;ref name="pulitzer"&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1987 Pulitzer Prize Awards List 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; The strip eventually appeared in over 1,200 newspapers around the world until Breathed retired the daily strip in 1989, stating that he wanted to terminate the strip while it was still popular. At that time, he said, "A good comic strip is no more eternal than a ripe melon. The ugly truth is that in most cases, comics age less gracefully than their creators".&lt;ref name="website"&gt;[http://www.berkeleybreathed.com/pages/About.asp The Official Berkeley Breathed Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513175844/http://www.berkeleybreathed.com/pages/About.asp |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He replaced this strip with the surreal Sunday-only cartoon ''[[Outland (comics)|Outland]]'' in 1989, which reused some of the ''Bloom County'' characters, including [[Opus the Penguin]] and [[Bill the Cat]]. He ended ''Outland'' in 1995.

In 2003, Breathed began the comic strip ''[[Opus (comic strip)|Opus]]'', a Sunday-only strip featuring Opus the Penguin, who was one of the main characters of ''Bloom County''.

Several newspapers chose not to run the August 26, 2007, ''Opus'' cartoon because it might offend Muslims.&lt;ref name="foxnews"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,294779,00.html Donaldson-Evans, Catherine, "Washington Post, Other Newspapers Won't Run 'Opus' Cartoon Mocking Radical Islam"], [[Fox News]], August 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2008, Breathed announced plans to discontinue all work on comic strips with the final ''Opus'' strip to run on November 2, 2008.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2008/10/berkeley-breath.html Stern, Sherry, "Berkeley Breathed says goodbye to Opus: 'I'm destroying the village to save it'"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', October 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Breathed planned to focus on writing [[children's literature|children's books]].&lt;ref name=houston /&gt; Breathed explained that he felt that the United States was going to face "tough times", and that he wanted to end the saga of his most memorable character "on a lighter note".

The last ''Opus'' comic strip appeared on schedule, but in what may be a comic first the final panel required an online link. The final panel of the strip showed Opus sleeping peacefully in the bed depicted in the classic children's book, ''[[Goodnight Moon]]''. This panel was available only online, and the [[Humane Society of the United States]] page that displayed it no longer exists.

Breathed said that he had no regrets in leaving political cartooning, as he believed the atmosphere became too bitter for him to make quality cartoons.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;"[http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/10/13/berkeley.breathed/index.html Vick dog inspired 'Bloom County,' 'Opus' creator]." ''[[CNN]]''. October 13, 2009. Retrieved on October 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 Breathed hinted at a return to the strip when he posted a photo to Facebook of him at his computer, starting a cartoon entitled "Bloom County 2015".  He added: "A return after 25 years. Feels like going home."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/berkeleybreathed/photos/a.114529165244512.10815.108793262484769/1003525033011583/]&lt;/ref&gt; The strip was later posted to Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/berkeleybreathed/photos/a.114529165244512.10815.108793262484769/1004028256294594/]&lt;/ref&gt; He has subsequently been posting new ''Bloom County'' strips via Facebook on an almost-daily basis, as of January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;

==Other works==
Breathed's syndicated and Facebook cartoon work has produced at least thirteen cartoon anthology books, as of January 2018. Starting in 1992, he designed a greeting card and gift ensemble collection for [[American Greetings]], featuring the "Bloom County" characters [[Opus the Penguin|Opus]], [[Bill the Cat]], and [[Milquetoast the Cockroach]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2018, Breathed has produced ten children's picture books, three of which were made into the animated films ''[[A Wish for Wings That Work]]'' ([[Amblin Entertainment|Amblin Television]]/[[Universal Cartoon Studios]], 1991) and ''[[Edwurd Fudwupper Fibbed Big]]'' ([[Nickelodeon Movies]], 2000), and the motion-capture film ''[[Mars Needs Moms]]'' ([[Disney]], 2011).

Breathed's writing has also been featured in numerous publications, including ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Boating (magazine)|Boating]]'', and ''[[Travel and Leisure]]''.  He produced the cartoon art for the closing credits of the Texas-based 2003 film, ''[[Secondhand Lions]]'', which featured a strip called ''Walter and Jasmine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=February 3, 2018 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panels that Breathed drew for ''Secondhand Lions'' appear in his cartoon anthology book ''Opus: 25 Years of His Sunday Best'', in which Breathed terms them "the comic strip that never was".

Breathed has been a supporter of the [[animal rights]] group [[PETA]] and illustrated the cover of earlier printings of PETA's cookbook - ''[[The Compassionate Cook, or, "Please Don't Eat the Animals!"]]'' -, T-shirts, and other merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breathed cameos as himself in the 2004 short film ''[[Tim Warner: A Life in the Clouds]]'', a fictional tale about an unhappy cartoonist and his unfunny strip, ''The Silver Lining''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Personal life==
&lt;!--In order to mention anything related to spasmodic torticollis, ''please provide a reliable source from a newspaper--&gt;
Breathed is a fan of outdoor activities such as [[powerboat]]ing and [[motorcycle|motorcycling]]. In 1986, he broke his back in an [[ultralight-plane]] crash, later incorporated into a ''Bloom County'' storyline in which Steve Dallas breaks his back after being attacked by an angry [[Sean Penn]]. Breathed also nearly lost his right arm to a boating accident.&lt;ref name="latimesblog" /&gt;

Breathed once stated he is an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200402/berkeley-breathed-pokes-fun Whitney, William, "Berkeley Breathed Pokes Fun"], ''[[Psychology Today]]'', January/February 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, 2008, in his comic strip ''Opus'', he announced he was suffering from a condition known as [[spasmodic torticollis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/comics/opus/2008/05/18/opus/index.html Breathed, Berkeley, ''Opus'': "Anyone got a remedy for pain?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220094912/http://www.salon.com/comics/opus/2008/05/18/opus/index.html |date=February 20, 2011 }} [[Salon.com]], May 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
