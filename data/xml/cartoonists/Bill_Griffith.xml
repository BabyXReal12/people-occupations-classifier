'''William Henry Jackson "Bill" Griffith''' (born January 20, 1944) is an American [[cartoonist]] who signs his work '''Bill Griffith''' and '''Griffy'''. He is best known for his [[daily comic strip]] ''[[Zippy the Pinhead|Zippy]]''.&lt;ref name= lambiek&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/griffith.htm |title= Bill Griffith | website= Lambiek.net| publisher= ''Lambiek Encyclopedia''| date= July 10, 2016| access-date= June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[catchphrase]] "Are we having fun yet?" is credited to Griffith.&lt;ref name= Bartletts&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| work= [[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]| edition= 16th | year= 1992| title= Are we having fun yet?| publisher= | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, family and education==
{{expand-section| date= June 2017}}
Born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Griffith grew up in [[Levittown, New York]] on [[Long Island]]. One of his neighbors was [[science fiction]] illustrator [[Ed Emshwiller]], whom he credits with pointing him towards the world of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aabillgr.html |title= Bill Griffith | website= zippythepinhead.com| date= | publisher= | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
Griffith began his comics career in [[New York City]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=Battista /&gt; His first [[comic strip]]s in the ''[[East Village Other]]'' and ''[[Screw (magazine)|Screw]]'' featured an angry amphibian named Mr. The Toad.&lt;ref name= lambiek /&gt;

===Underground comix===
In 1969, Griffith began making [[underground comix]].&lt;ref name= lambiek /&gt; He ventured to [[San Francisco]], [[California]] in 1970&lt;ref name= lambiek /&gt; to join its burgeoning underground comix movement&lt;ref name=Battista /&gt; and gained prominence in it, first with a hit comic ''Young Lust'', "an X-rated parody of girl's romance comics."&lt;ref name= heller&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/12/bill-griffith-the-man-who-made-zippy-a-pinhead/249919/ | title= Bill Griffith: The Man Who Made Zippy a Pinhead | work= [[The Atlantic]] | first= Steve| last= Heller | date= December 22, 2011| access-date= June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-created with cartoonist [[Jay Kinney]].{{cn|date= June 2017}} Other early major comic book titles included ''Tales of Toad''. He co-founded the comics anthology ''[[Arcade (comics magazine)|Arcade, the Comics Revue]]'' with [[Art Spiegelman]] and co-edited for its seven-issue run in the mid-1970s. Griffith has worked with the leading underground publishers throughout that decade and up to the present: [[Print Mint]], [[Last Gasp]], [[Rip Off Press]], [[Kitchen Sink (publisher)|Kitchen Sink]] and [[Fantagraphics Books]]. He contributed comics and illustrations to a variety of publications, including ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'', ''[[High Times]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Village Voice]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''.

===''Zippy''===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Billgriffith122806.gif|right|thumb|560px|Bill Griffith's ''[[Zippy the Pinhead|Zippy]]'' (December 28, 2006). Griffith often draws himself into his strip.]] --&gt;
The first ''Zippy'' strip appeared in the underground ''Real Pulp'' #1 (Print Mint) in 1971. The strip went weekly in 1976, first in the ''[[Berkeley Barb]]'' and then syndicated nationally through Rip Off Press.&lt;ref name= lambiek /&gt; The one-row format ''Zippy'' strip debuted in the ''Berkeley Barb'' in 1976 and continues in weekly newspapers.

In 1979, he added his [[alter ego]] character, Griffy,&lt;ref name= heller /&gt; to the strip. He describes Griffy as "neurotic, self-righteous and opinionated, someone with whom Zippy would certainly contrast. I brought the two characters together around 1979, perhaps symbolically bringing together the two halves of my personality. It worked. Their relationship seemed to make Zippy's random nuttiness more directed and Griffy's cranky, critical persona had his foil, someone to bounce happily off of his constant analysis of everything and everyone around him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=KECrByuSZF8C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=zippy+%22bill+griffith%22#v=onepage&amp;q=zippy%20%22bill%20griffith%22&amp;f=false |last1= Dooley| first1= Michael Patrick| first2= Stephen| last2= Heller|title=The Education of a Comics Artist|publisher=Allworth Press|year=2005|page=43| isbn= 9781581154085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the "Zippy Theme Song" was composed and performed, with lyrics by The [[B-52s]]' Fred Schneider and vocals by [[The Manhattan Transfer|Manhattan Transfer]]'s [[Janis Siegel (singer)|Janis Siegel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/themsong.htm |title= Zippy Theme Song| website= zippythepinhead.com| date= | publisher= | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on the cut are singers [[Phoebe Snow]] and [[Jon Hendricks]].

The daily ''Zippy'' strip (syndicated by [[King Features Syndicate|King Features]] to over 200&lt;ref name= lambiek /&gt; newspapers worldwide) started in 1986. Griffith compares the creation of the strip to jazz: "When I'm doing a ''Zippy'' strip, I'm aware that I'm weaving elements together, almost improvising, as if I were all the instruments in a little jazz combo, then stepping back constantly to edit and fine-tune. Playing with language is what delights Zippy the most."&lt;ref name=is&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aaishehavingfunyet.html |title= Is he having fun yet?| website= zippythepinhead.com| date= | publisher= | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years ago, as continuity strips gave way to humor strips, typeset episode subtitles vanished from strips. In a nod toward the classic daily strips of yesteryear, Griffith keeps the tradition alive by always centering a hand-lettered subtitle above each ''Zippy'' strip.

In 2007, Griffith began to focus his daily strip on Zippy's "birthplace", Dingburg.&lt;ref name= heller /&gt; Griffith said, "Over the years, I began to expand Zippy's circle of friends beyond my usual cast of characters to a  wider world of people like Zippy&amp;mdash;other pinheads. I kept this up for a few months, happily adding more and more muu-muu-clad men and women until one day the whole thing just reached critical mass. The thought then occurred, 'Where do all these friends of Zippy live? Do they live in the real world which Zippy has been seen escaping for years&amp;mdash;or do they live apart, in a pinhead world of their own?' Thus Dingburg, 'The City Inhabited Entirely by Pinheads' was born. It even had a motto: 'Going too far is half the pleasure of not getting anywhere'. The logical next step was to imagine Dingburg streets and neighborhoods&amp;mdash;to create a place where Zippy's wacky rules would be the norm and everyone would play 24-hour Skeeball and worship at the feet of the giant Muffler Man. Zippy had, at last, found his home town."

In 2008, Griffith presented a talk on Zippy at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. In it, he laid out his [https://web.archive.org/web/20100421201121/http://twitpic.com/1fusqz/full "Top 40 List on Comics and their Creation"], which since then has been reposted on numerous comics websites.

===Other works===
For a short period, Griffith joined the team of artists, including [[Kim Deitch]], [[Drew Friedman (cartoonist)|Drew Friedman]], [[Jay Lynch]], [[Norman Saunders]], [[Art Spiegelman]], [[Bhob Stewart]] and [[Tom Sutton]], who designed [[Wacky Packages]] [[trading cards]] for the [[Topps]] Company. Griffith recently drew Wacky Packages Old School Sketch Cards for Topps.

In 2015 Fantagraphics published Griffith's memoir ''Invisible Ink: My Mother’s Secret Love Affair With a Famous Cartoonist''.

==Personal life==
For over a decade, starting in 1957, Griffith's mother Barbara had an affair with cartoonist [[Lawrence Lariar]]; this formed the basis of Bill Griffith's 2015 graphic novel ''Invisible Ink: My Mother’s Secret Love Affair With a Famous Cartoonist''.&lt;ref name=TCJ&gt;[http://www.tcj.com/i-had-moments-where-i-just-broke-down-crying-an-interview-with-bill-griffith/ “I Had Moments Where I Just Broke Down Crying”: An Interview with Bill Griffith], by Chris Mauther, in ''[[The Comics Journal]]''; published November 23, 2015; retrieved December 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

''Invisible Ink'' depicts various other details and incidents involving Griffith's family, including the fact that Griffith himself is the great-grandson of the photographer and artist [[William Henry Jackson]], and was named for him. 

Griffith's first wife, Nancy, was also involved in the underground comix community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Fox| first= M. Steven| url= http://comixjoint.com/fits2.html |title= Fits #2| website= ComixJoint.com| access-date= December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Griffith moved from San Francisco to [[Connecticut]]. His studio is in [[East Haddam, Connecticut]], where he resides with his second wife, cartoonist [[Diane Noomin]].&lt;ref name=Battista&gt;{{cite news| last= Battista| first= Carolyn| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/11/nyregion/q-a-bill-griffith-exploring-the-state-with-zippy-and-griffy.html | title= Q&amp;A/Bill Griffith; Exploring The State With Zippy and Griffy| work= [[The New York Times]]| date= July 11, 1999| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= lambiek /&gt;
