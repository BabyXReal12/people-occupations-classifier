'''Gahan Wilson''' (born February 18, 1930) is an American author, [[cartoonist]] and illustrator known for his cartoons depicting horror-fantasy situations. 

Wilson was born in [[Evanston, Illinois]].  He has been married to author Nancy Winters (née Nancy Dee Midyette) since 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcj.com/gahan-wilson/ Gehr, Richard. ''The Comics Journal'', April 27, 2011.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705135402/http://www.tcj.com/gahan-wilson/ |date=July 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Wilson's cartoons and illustrations are drawn in a playfully grotesque style and have a dark humor that is often compared to the work of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' cartoonist and ''[[The Addams Family|Addams Family]]'' creator [[Charles Addams]]{{fact|date=February 2015}}. But while both feature [[vampires]], [[cemetery|cemeteries]] and other traditional horror elements in their work, Addams' cartoons are [[Gothic art|gothic]], reserved and old-fashioned, while Wilson's work is more contemporary, gross and confrontational, featuring atomic mutants, subway monsters and serial killers. It could be argued that Addams' work was probably meant to be funny without a lot of satirical intent, while Wilson often has a very specific point to make.

Wilson was inspired by the irreverent work of the various satiric ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' and ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoonists, as well as the science fiction monster films of the 1950s. His cartoons and prose fiction appeared regularly in ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]'' for almost 50 years. In addition to his cartoons for ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'', he also wrote [[Film|movie]] and [[book]] reviews for that publication. From 1992 through end of publication, he prepared all the front covers for the annual book ''Passport to World Band Radio''. He has been a movie review columnist for ''[[The Twilight Zone Magazine]]'' and a book critic for ''[[Realms of Fantasy]]'' magazine.

His [[comic strip]] ''Nuts'', which appeared in ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'', was a reaction against what he saw as the saccharine view of [[child]]hood in strips like ''[[Peanuts]]''. &lt;!-- see comment on talk page--&gt; His hero, The Kid, sees the world as dark, dangerous and unfair—but also occasionally a fun place.

Wilson wrote and illustrated a short story for [[Harlan Ellison]]'s [[anthology]] ''[[Again, Dangerous Visions]]'' (1972). The "title" is a black blob, and the story is about an ominous black blob that appears on the page, growing at an alarming rate. He has contributed short stories to other publications as well; "M1" and "The Zombie Butler" both appeared in ''The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction'' and were reprinted in ''Gahan Wilson's Cracked Cosmos'' (1975).

Wilson created a computer game, ''Gahan Wilson's [[The Ultimate Haunted House]]'', with [[Byron Preiss]]. The goal is to collect 13 keys in 13 hours from the 13 rooms of a house by interacting in various ways with characters (two-headed monster, mad scientist, vampiress), objects and the house itself.

Wilson wrote the 1992 animated short ''Diner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312624/|title=Gahan Wilson's Diner|author=|date=31 July 1992|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2018|via=www.imdb.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209063249/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312624/|archivedate=9 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Fantagraphics Books released ''Gahan Wilson: 50 Years of Playboy Cartoons'', a slipcased, three-volume collection of Wilson's cartoons and short stories for that magazine. A collection of his work, ''Fifty Years of Gahan Wilson'', was published in 2010. Fantagraphics announced a "complete" edition of ''Nuts'' for the Spring of 2011.

==Awards==
In 2005, Wilson was recognized with Lifetime Achievement from the World Fantasy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=World Fantasy Convention |year=2010 |title=Award Winners and Nominees |url=http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html/ |accessdate=4 Feb 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201074405/http://worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html |archivedate=2010-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[World Fantasy Convention Award]] (in the form of the bust of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] that he had designed as the award trophy in 1975) in 1981. He also received the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005.

Wilson is the subject of a feature-length documentary film, ''Gahan Wilson: Born Dead, Still Weird'', directed by [[Steven-Charles Jaffe]].

He was an influence on later alternative cartoonists, including [[Gary Larson]], [[John Callahan (cartoonist)|John Callahan]] and [[Bill Plympton]].
