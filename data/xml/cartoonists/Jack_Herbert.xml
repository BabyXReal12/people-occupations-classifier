== Early life ==
Jack was born on February 28, 1982 in [[Bananeiras]], Paraíba where he lived a "typical middle-class childhood". He became interested in drawing from early childhood and at age of nine, an aunt showed him an interview with [[Mike Deodato]] in the local newspaper, what caused him great impact because Deodato also lived in Paraíba and drew for the great American publishers. Jack explains, ''"And that's when I discovered that I could live with comics, work with comics. So it was from there that I came to believe."''.&lt;ref name=espexpi&gt;{{cite web |url= http://espaco-experimental.blogspot.com.br/2014/02/jackson-herbert-i-ed-122014.html|title= Jackson Herbert – I|first= Amanda|last= Félix|date= February 1, 2014|publisher= Espaço Experimental|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170204082200/http://espaco-experimental.blogspot.com.br/2014/02/jackson-herbert-i-ed-122014.html|archivedate=February 4, 2017 |deadurl= no|quote= E foi quando eu descobri que dava pra viver de quadrinhos, trabalhar com quadrinhos. Então, foi a partir daí que eu passei a acreditar.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 10, his family moved to [[João Pessoa, Paraíba|João Pessoa]] where he lives until now.

In the 90's, he was first influenced by superheroes when he discovered [[Jim Lee]]'s [[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]] and the TV serie [[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: Animated Series]].

==== Red Sonja Series ====
In the early 2000's, Dynamite acquired the comic book rights to Red Sonja and decided to bring back Sonja’s classic bikini armor for her new series, which debuted in 2005. The series was an immediate hit, becoming Dynamite’s best-selling title and firmly returning Red Sonja to mainstream popularity. The character now has a monthly series, together with a series of mini-series and one-shots, all published by Dynamite Entertainment. The main Red Sonja series features a number of cover artists as well as the regular team of writer [[Michael Avon Oeming]] and artist [[Mel Rubi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/infoDB.html?show=NS07100958035|title= Red Sonja|publisher= Dynamite Entertainment|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170209220400/http://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/infoDB.html?show=NS07100958035|archivedate=February 9, 2017 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Herbert did cover work for that series in the issues [[Red Sonja]] #41–45 and also for [[Red Sonja|Queen Sonja]] #1–5. During the year 2010, Jack Herbert worked in the title Queen Sonja making full pencils, inks and covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?PRO=C725130138705|title= Queen Sonja #6|publisher= Dynamite Entertainment|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170206074200/http://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?PRO=C725130138705|archivedate=February 6, 2017 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that, he was the penciler of [[Jason Todd|Red Hood]] chapter in [[Secret Origins]] #5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://batman-news.com/2014/08/27/secret-origins-5-review/|title= Secret Origins #5 - Review|publisher= Batman News|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170206120300/http://batman-news.com/2014/08/27/secret-origins-5-review/|archivedate=February 6, 2017 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then shares with Ken Lashley the art in [[Superman: Doomed]] # 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbr.com/superman-doomed-2/|title= Superman: Doomed #2|publisher= CBR|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170206120800/http://www.cbr.com/superman-doomed-2/|archivedate=February 6, 2017 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still in 2014, his participation in [[Superman/Wonder Woman]] #12&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dccomics.com/comics/superman-wonder-woman-2013/supermanwonder-woman-12|title= Superman Wonder Woman #12|publisher= DC Comics|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170206121000/http://www.dccomics.com/comics/superman-wonder-woman-2013/supermanwonder-woman-12|archivedate=February 6, 2017 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; was marked by the hugging scene between Superman and Wonder Woman in a football stadium that is shared by many fans of the power couple on the internet.

In the next year, Jack contributes as penciller in six editions of [[Kingdom Come (comics)|Earth 2]]: World's End and in [[The New 52: Futures End|The New 52 Futures End]] #45&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://all-comic.com/2015/new-52-futures-end-45/|title= The New 52: Futures End #45|publisher= All-Comic.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170206121500/http://all-comic.com/2015/new-52-futures-end-45/|archivedate=February 6, 2017 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with several other artists like: Thompson, Cifuentes, Lemire and Jurgens. In late 2015, while drawing the pages for Titans Hunt #3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.weirdsciencedccomics.com/2015/12/titans-hunt-3-review-and-spoilers.html|title= Titans Hunt #3 - Review and Spoilers|publisher= Weird Science|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170206122100/http://www.weirdsciencedccomics.com/2015/12/titans-hunt-3-review-and-spoilers.html|archivedate=February 6, 2017 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; his art earned him praise from [[Jim Lee]] due to light composition. Jack met Jim Lee personally at CCXP that year in São Paulo. In that issue, he shared the pencils with Paulo Siqueira and Geraldo Borges.

In 2006, DC Comics started a Rebirth. [[DC Rebirth]] restored the [[DC Universe]] to a form much like that prior to the "Flashpoint" storyline while still incorporating numerous elements of [[The New 52]], including its continuity. In this year, Jack works in the Rebirth titles: [[Green Lantern Corps|Green Lanterns Corps]] Edge of Oblivion #6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dccomics.com/comics/green-lantern-corps-edge-of-oblivion-2016/green-lantern-corps-edge-of-oblivion-6|title= Green Lanterns Corps: Edge of Oblivion #6|publisher= DC Comics|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170206122600/http://www.dccomics.com/comics/green-lantern-corps-edge-of-oblivion-2016/green-lantern-corps-edge-of-oblivion-6|archivedate=February 6, 2017 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with writer Tom Taylor and colorist Hi-Fi, [[Green Lantern]]s #6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dccomics.com/comics/green-lanterns-2016/green-lanterns-6|title= Green Lanterns #6|publisher= DC Comics|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170206122300/http://www.dccomics.com/comics/green-lanterns-2016/green-lanterns-6|archivedate=February 6, 2017 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and #7&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dccomics.com/comics/green-lanterns-2016/green-lanterns-7|title= Green Lanterns #7|publisher= DC Comics|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170206122300/http://www.dccomics.com/comics/green-lanterns-2016/green-lanterns-7|archivedate=February 6, 2017 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with plot of [[Sam Humphries]] and sharing pencils with Will Conrad, and in [[Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity|Trinity]] #3 as fill in, but his pages weren't published.

Jack is currently working with writer [[Phil Jimenez]] on [[Superwoman]] and colorist Hi-Fi. His art appears in the series from issue #6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbr.com/superwoman-6/|title= Superwoman #6 (Preview)|publisher= CBR|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170206122900/http://www.cbr.com/superwoman-6/|archivedate=February 6, 2017 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
