'''James O'Barr''' is an American [[graphic artist]], best known as the creator of the comic book series ''[[The Crow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= From the Beginning, 'The Crow' Had a Grim Side : Movies: James O'Barr's comic book might have adapted smoothly to the big screen, but it was spurred by personal tragedy.|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1994-05-30|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-30/entertainment/ca-63961_1_comic-book|accessdate=2010-12-04|first=Robert|last=Levine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
O'Barr, an [[orphan]], was raised in the [[foster care]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/zine/darkdreams/crowbirth.html |title=Dark Dreams: How the Crow was Born : James O'Barr |accessdate=2008-04-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040909202741/http://www.angelfire.com/zine/darkdreams/crowbirth.html |archivedate=September  9, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1978, O'Barr enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. While stationed in Germany, he illustrated combat manuals for the military. 

Before entering the Marines, O'Barr's fiancée, Beverly, had been killed by a drunk driver. While living in Berlin in 1981, O'Barr began work on his comic ''The Crow'' as a means of dealing with his personal tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thing.net/~lilyvac/writing35.html |title=DIKE BLAIR &amp;#124; Writing |publisher=Thing.net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Barr was further inspired by a Detroit newspaper account of the murder of a young couple over a $20 engagement ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaos2000.net/interviews/jamesobarr/ |title=KAOS2000 Magazine interview with James O'Barr / The Crow |publisher=Kaos2000.net |date=2000-07-20 |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Crow'', a man and his fiancée are murdered by a gang of criminals. The man then returns from the dead, guided by a supernatural [[crow]], to hunt their killers.

After his discharge from the Marines, O'Barr continued his painting and illustration as well as doing various odd jobs, including working for a Detroit body shop. ''The Crow'' sat on a shelf for seven years, but at last he found a publisher with [[Gary Reed (comic writer)|Gary Reed]] of [[Caliber Press]]. The first mini-series was published in 1989. ''The Crow'' has since sold more than 750,000 copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/conventions/texas/006266510.cfm ''Wizard'' magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210001105/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/conventions/texas/006266510.cfm |date=2007-12-10 }} Link inactive 24 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Barr's own hope that his project would result in a personal [[catharsis]] went unfulfilled, he told an interviewer in 1994, saying, "[A]s I drew each page, it made me more self-destructive, if anything... There is pure anger on each page".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrow.info/granovel.htm |title=Graphic novel |publisher=TheCrow.info |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1990s O'Barr was affiliated with the experimental [[metal band]] Trust Obey, which was signed briefly to [[Trent Reznor]]'s Nothing label.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Trust Obey released the album ''[[Fear and Bullets]]: Music to Accompany The Crow'' in 1993. The album was packaged with a special edition of ''[[The Crow]]'' [[graphic novel]].

''The Crow'' was adapted into a successful [[The Crow (1994 film)|film of the same name]] in 1994, which was marred by the tragic death of its star, [[Brandon Lee]], during filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inner_mercy.tripod.com/Accident.html |title=Mercy.Tripod.com |publisher=Inner_mercy.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film went on to spawn three sequels and a television series.

After the success of ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' film, O'Barr began planning a post-apocalyptic graphic novel series entitled ''Gothik''. The series was based on ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and featured "Jonny Z" from his short story "[[Frame 137]]" as the main character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guitarinternational.com/2011/10/04/interview-with-the-crow-author-artist-musician-james-obarr-let-the-picture-tell-the-story/ |title=Interview With "The Crow" Author, Artist, Musician James O’Barr: "Let The Picture Tell The Story" |publisher=Guitar International |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114095911/http://guitarinternational.com/2011/10/04/interview-with-the-crow-author-artist-musician-james-obarr-let-the-picture-tell-the-story/ |archivedate=2011-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 Motionworks Entertainment released O'Barr's western comic, ''Sundown'', which served as their debut motion comic.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish, Robin (January 21, 2013). [http://www.forevergeek.com/2013/01/review-james-obarrs-sundown-1/ "Review: James O’Barr’s Sundown #1"]. Forever Geek.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motionworkscomics.com/frontpage/live-broadcast-sundown-premiere.html |title=Motionworkscomics.com |publisher=Motionworks Entertainment |date= |accessdate=2011-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317102829/http://www.motionworkscomics.com/frontpage/live-broadcast-sundown-premiere.html |archivedate=2012-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also announced his work on a comic about the [[Korean War]], centered on the efforts of three US Marine guncrews to hold Fox Hill during the [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir]], with a different artist drawing each gun crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with James O’Barr, creator of The Crow|url=http://www.korsgaardscommentary.com/2014/10/interview-james-obarr-creator-crow.html|website=Korsgaard's Commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, O'Barr was named as a consultant on a possible reboot of ''The Crow'' film franchise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2013/film/news/james-obarr-boards-the-crow-remake-exclusive-1200504262/ James O’Barr Boards ‘The Crow’ Reboot (EXCLUSIVE)]&lt;/ref&gt; Although previously opposed to the project, in an October 2014 interview, O'Barr spoke about his involvement in the reboot of ''The Crow''. He discussed the approach to the adaptation and efforts being made to respect the original film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with James O’Barr, creator of The Crow|url=http://www.korsgaardscommentary.com/2014/10/interview-james-obarr-creator-crow.html|website=Korsgaard's Commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in November 2014, O'Barr appeared at the Wizard World Tulsa Comic Con and stated that he was co-writing the script with screenwriter Cliff Dorfman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James O'Barr Talks About Writing Crow Reboot|url=http://renegadecinema.com/34684/james-obarr-talks-about-writing-crow-reboot|website=Renegade Cinema}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
As of the mid-2000s, O'Barr resides in [[Dallas]] with his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/mixmaster/2011/07/james_obarr_on_the_20th_annive.php|title=James O'Barr on The Crow's 20th Anniversary, His New Project and Dallas|publisher=Dallas Observer|date=2011-07-26|accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
