His first published front cover was ''The Comic Reader'' #196 in November 1981. In 1982 he graduated from the [[California College of the Arts]] with a BFA in Illustration.&lt;ref name=mm&gt;{{cite web|author=Norrena, Jim|title=Spotlight: Mike Mignola|url=http://www.cca.edu/alumni/profiles/mmignola|publisher=[[California College of the Arts]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120717040602/http://www.cca.edu/news/2009/11/12/alumnus-spotlight-mike-mignola|archivedate= July 17, 2012|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 he worked as an inker at [[Marvel Comics]] on ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' and ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' and later on titles such as ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'', and the ''[[Rocket Raccoon (limited series)|Rocket Raccoon]]'' limited series.

In 1987, he began working for [[DC Comics]] as well. He drew the ''[[Phantom Stranger]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Greenberger|first= Robert|authorlink= Robert Greenberger|title= The Paul Kupperberg ''Phantom Stranger'' Interview|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 92|pages= 44-50|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= October 2016|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Krypton (comics)|World of Krypton]]'' limited series.&lt;ref name="GCD"&gt;{{gcdb|type=credit|search= Mike+Mignola|title= Mike Mignola}}&lt;/ref&gt; With writer [[Jim Starlin]], Mignola produced the ''[[Cosmic Odyssey (comics)|Cosmic Odyssey]]'' miniseries in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 235 |quote = Writer Jim Starlin and artist Mike Mignola teamed up for a sci-fi miniseries that spanned the [DC Universe].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mignola drew covers for several Batman stories, including "[[Batman: A Death in the Family]]"&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 235: "Written by Jim Starlin, with art by Jim Aparo and haunting covers by Mike Mignola, 'A Death in the Family' proved a best seller with readers in both single-issue and trade paperback form."&lt;/ref&gt; and "Dark Knight, Dark City".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dougall|first2=Alastair, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title= Batman: A Visual History|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2014|location= London, United Kingdom|page= 188|isbn= 978-1465424563|quote= Writer Peter Milligan penned this memorable three-issue storyline, illustrated by Kieron Dwyer and with cover art by Mike Mignola, in which the Riddler proved that he was still a serious threat to Batman.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Brian Augustyn]] and Mignola crafted the ''[[Gotham by Gaslight]]'' one-shot in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 241: "An 'alternate history of the Batman' was spawned in this dark prestige format one-shot by writer Brian Augustyn and artist Mike Mignola."&lt;/ref&gt; Through the early 1990s Mignola worked on covers and backup features for various DC and Marvel Comics.&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt; He collaborated twice with writer [[Howard Chaykin]]. In 1990-1991, they produced the ''[[Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser]]'' limited series for [[Epic Comics]], with inker [[Al Williamson]].

===''Hellboy'' and related spin-offs===
{{main article|Hellboy Universe}}

====''Hellboy''====
Prior to 1994 Mignola had done [[work-for-hire]] illustration. That year, [[Dark Horse Comics]] released ''[[Hellboy: Seed of Destruction]]'', Mignola's [[Creator ownership|creator-owned]] project. Though he wrote the story himself, it was scripted by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. The next ''Hellboy'' story, ''[[Hellboy: The Chained Coffin and Others#The Wolves of Saint August|The Wolves of Saint August]]'', was completely written and drawn by Mike Mignola. Since then all ''Hellboy'' stories have been written solely by Mike Mignola with the exception of ''[[Hellboy: The Crooked Man and Others#They That Go Down to the Sea in Ships|They That Go Down to the Sea in Ships]]'' which was co-written by ''Joshua Dysart''.

''[[Hellboy: The Troll Witch and Others#Makoma|Makoma]]'' (2006) was the first ''Hellboy'' story not drawn by Mignola, featuring the art of  [[Richard Corben]]. Corben would return to draw many flashback stories for the series. Other artists have also had a hand in drawing flashback stories including [[Jason Shawn Alexander]], [[Kevin Nowlan]] and [[Scott Hampton]]. In 2007, following after 2005's ''[[Hellboy: Strange Places#The Island|The Island]]'', British artist [[Duncan Fegredo]] took over art duties on the ongoing story arc of ''Hellboy'' from ''[[Hellboy: Darkness Calls|Darkness Calls]]'' onwards.

Mike Mignola returned as the full-time artist for ''Hellboy'' in 2012 for the ongoing series, ''Hellboy in Hell''. The series is currently published sporadically, but multiple-issue stories are monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khouri |first=Andy |title=''Hellboy in Hell'' is the Comic Mike Mignola Will Be Drawing for the Rest of His Life |url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/12/14/hellboy-in-hell-mike-mignola-interview/ |date=December 14, 2012 |publisher=Comics Alliance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108130929/http://comicsalliance.com/hellboy-in-hell-mike-mignola-interview/ |archivedate=November 8, 2013 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Abe Sapien''====
In 1998 the first ''Hellboy'' spin-off, ''[[Abe Sapien#Publication History|Abe Sapien]]'', was launched. It was not written by Mike Mignola, but it did feature his ''Hellboy'' short story "[[Hellboy: The Right Hand of Doom#Heads|Heads]]" as a back-up. ''Abe Sapien'' did not take off properly until a decade later in 2008's ''The Drowning''. Since then it has had several short stories and beginning in 2013 it became an ongoing series with [[Scott Allie]] as the lead writer with Mignola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salvatore|first=Brian|title=Talkin’ Abe Sapien with Scott Allie|url=http://multiversitycomics.com/interviews/mignolaversity-talkin-abe-sapien-with-scott-allie-interview/|date= March 1, 2013|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131102020721/http://multiversitycomics.com/interviews/mignolaversity-talkin-abe-sapien-with-scott-allie-interview/|archivedate= November 2, 2013|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Lobster Johnson''====
''[[Lobster Johnson]]'' was the next spin-off, debuting as a back-up feature in 1999's ''[[Hellboy: The Right Hand of Doom#Box Full of Evil|Box Full of Evil]]''. The series got its own title later in 2007's ''Lobster Johnson: The Iron Prometheus''. It returned again with the [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''The Burning Hand'' in 2012, followed by various short stories.

====''B.P.R.D.''====
''[[B.P.R.D.#Publication History|B.P.R.D.]]'' was the third spin-off, but it was the first one which was conceived to be more than just a one-off side story, but rather a series of stories.&lt;ref name="Introduction by Scott Allie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mignola|first=Mike|title=B.P.R.D.: Plague of Frogs - Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]]|isbn=978-1-59582-609-1|chapter= Introduction by Scott Allie|url=http://www.darkhorse.com/Books/17-169/B-P-R-D-Plague-of-Frogs-Hardcover-Collection-Vol-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began with 2002's ''[[B.P.R.D.: Hollow Earth and Other Stories|Hollow Earth]]'', which continued on from ''[[Hellboy: Conqueror Worm]]''. Beyond that followed a series of short stories designed to explore what the B.P.R.D. series could be. 2004's ''[[B.P.R.D.: Plague of Frogs|Plague of Frogs]]'' was the story that solidified what the series was, and would set the direction for future books to come, so much so that the first major story cycle is collected in omnibus editions titled ''B.P.R.D.: Plague of Frogs''. A vast majority of the stories in this era were co-written with [[John Arcudi]] and drawn by [[Guy Davis (comics)|Guy Davis]].

====''B.P.R.D.: Hell on Earth''====
''[[B.P.R.D.#B.P.R.D. Hell on Earth Trade Paperbacks|B.P.R.D.: Hell on Earth]]'' is the main series continuing after the catastrophic events at the conclusion of the ''Plague of Frogs'' cycle. Guy Davis left the series in 2011 with the conclusion of ''Hell on Earth: Gods''. [[Tyler Crook]] became the new ongoing artist beginning with ''Hell on Earth: Monsters'', but he is joined by several regular artists, most notably [[James Harren]] and [[Laurence Campbell]].

====''B.P.R.D.: The Devil You Know''====
Continuing on where ''Hell on Earth'' left off, ''The Devil You Know'' is written by Mike Mignola and [[Scott Allie]] with Laurence Campbell serving as the regular artist.

====''Sir Edward Grey, Witchfinder''====
''[[Hellboy Universe#Sir Edward Grey.2C Witchfinder|Sir Edward Grey, Witchfinder]]'' (more commonly known simply as "''Witchfinder''") began with a teaser story in 2008's [[Dark Horse Presents#Second incarnation: MDHP|''MySpace Dark Horse Presents'' #16]], followed by a full miniseries in 2009. It follows the stories of the occult investigator, Sir Edward, agent of [[Queen Victoria]].

====Spin-off miniseries====
The Hellboy Universe also includes numerous spin-offs that only span a single book:
* ''Sledgehammer 44'': Set in [[World War II]], this series is about the Epimetheus Vril Energy Suit created by Doctor Helena Gallargas.
* ''Frankenstein Underground'': Set in 1956, this series follows the Frankenstein monster as he ventures into the [[Pellucidar|Pellucidar-like Hollow Earth]].
* ''Rise of the Black Flame'': Set in 1923, this series explores how Raimund Diestel became the Black Flame.
* ''The Visitor: How &amp; Why He Stayed'': This series follows the life of an alien visitor set to kill the infant Hellboy in 1944.
* ''Rasputin: The Voice of the Dragon'': Set in 1941, this series follows Trevor Bruttenholm as he becomes a agent for the allied forces in World war II.
* ''Koshchei the Deathless'': Hellboy and Koshchei sit in a pub in Hell and chat.

===''Baltimore''===
''[[Baltimore (novel and comic series)|Baltimore]]'' is a series begun with a [[Baltimore, or The Steadfast Tin Soldier and the Vampire|2007 illustrated novel]], and continued as a comic book series. It was created by Mike Mignola and [[Christopher Golden]].

===''Joe Golem: Occult Detective''===
Like ''Baltimore'', ''Joe Golem: Occult Detective'' began as an illustrated prose novel  (2012's ''Joe Golem and the Drowning City'') and later continued as a comic book series. It was created by Mike Mignola and [[Christopher Golden]] and exists in a shared universe with ''Baltimore''.

==Style==
[[Alan Moore]] has described Mignola's style as "[[German expressionism]] meets [[Jack Kirby]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Mignola|first1 = Mike|last2= Moore|first2= Alan (Foreword only)|chapter= Foreword|title = Hellboy: Wake the Devil|publisher = Dark Horse Comics|year = 1997|pages = |isbn = 978-1593070953}}&lt;/ref&gt; His style has also been likened to an amalgamation of Jack Kirby and [[Alex Toth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Cooke|first = Jon B.|title = The Art of Arthur Adams|journal = [[Comic Book Artist]]|issue= 17|pages= |publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|date= January 2002|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|url= http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/17adams.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131103060249/http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/17adams.html|archivedate= November 3, 2013|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all|quote = Mike's style is almost a weird amalgamation of Kirby and Toth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television==
Mignola worked as an illustrator for [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s 1992 movie ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]''. He was also the production designer for the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] feature film, ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'' in 2001, and was a concept artist for 2002's ''[[Blade II]]'', also directed by del Toro, and a concept artist for [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]''.

Mignola was hired by [[Bruce Timm]] to provide character designs for ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' in 1991. His redesign of [[Mr. Freeze]] was used for the series.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;

Mignola's design of the 1880s Batman costume from the comic ''[[Batman: Gotham by Gaslight]]'' appeared in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''.

''Hellboy'' was made into a [[Hellboy (2004 film)|feature film]] in 2004 by director [[Guillermo del Toro]]. Mignola was closely involved with the movie's production, and a [[Hellboy II: The Golden Army|sequel]] was released in 2008. ''Hellboy'' has been made into two direct-to-video animated films, ''[[Hellboy: Sword of Storms|Sword of Storms]]'' in 2006 and ''[[Hellboy: Blood and Iron|Blood and Iron]]'' in 2007.

Mignola's ''[[The Amazing Screw-On Head]]'' debuted in 2006 on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]], starring the voices of [[Paul Giamatti]] and [[David Hyde Pierce]].

In May 2017 it was announced that Mignola will co-write the script for ''[[Hellboy: Rise of the Blood Queen]]'', an R-rated reboot film that will be directed by [[Neil Marshall]] and star [[David Harbour]] as Hellboy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/hellboy-reboot-works-stranger-things-star-david-harbour-1001462|title=''Hellboy'' Reboot In the Works With 'Stranger Things' Star David Harbour|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 8, 2017|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170612162910/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/hellboy-reboot-works-stranger-things-star-david-harbour-1001462|archivedate= June 12, 2017|deadurl= no|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018 [[TSG Entertainment]], makers of the 2017 film ''[[The Shape of Water]]'', approached Mignola to make the [[The Shape of Water|Amphibian Man]] part of the ''Hellboy'' universe. Mignola said that he currently has no plans to do it.
