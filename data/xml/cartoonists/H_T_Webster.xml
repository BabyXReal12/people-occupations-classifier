[[File:Htwebster.jpg|right|thumb|150px|H. T. Webster]]
'''Harold Tucker Webster''' (September 21, 1885 â€“ September 22, 1952) was an American cartoonist known for ''The Timid Soul'', ''Bridge'', ''Life's Darkest Moments'' and others in his syndicated series which ran from the 1920s into the 1950s. Because he disliked his given name, his readers knew him as '''H. T. Webster''', and his signature was simply '''Webster'''. His friends, however, called him '''Webby'''. 

Because of the humor and human interest in his cartoons, he was sometimes compared to [[Mark Twain]], and his art style was quite similar to the work of [[Clare Briggs]]. During his lifetime, Webster drew more than 16,000 single-panel cartoons. 

Born in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]] in 1885, Webster grew up in the small city (pop. 3,365) of [[Tomahawk, Wisconsin]] where his father was a druggist.&lt;ref name=web/&gt; He began drawing at age seven. When he was 12, he switched from cigarettes to cigars, and that same year he sold his first cartoon for $5 to the magazine ''Recreation''. 

He studied drawing from a correspondence course when he was 15, and two years later, he left high school and Tomahawk to study in Chicago at the Frank Holmes School of Illustration, where cartoonist [[Harry Hershfield]] had also studied. However, the Holmes School closed only a few weeks after Webster's arrival, bringing an end to his formal art training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1991/5/1991_5_100.shtml "Webster's Unalloyed", ''American Heritage''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201145316/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1991/5/1991_5_100.shtml |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With little success as a freelance artist, Webster began a salaried job with the ''Denver Republican'', moving to the rival ''[[Denver Post]]'' when he was offered $15 a week as a sports cartoonist. Webster commented, "If they had known it, they could have got me for $1.50".

He returned to Chicago, where he spent three years drawing front-page political cartoons for the ''[[Chicago Inter Ocean]]'', prompting one politician to introduce a bill in the state legislature forbidding unflattering cartoons. After two years with ''[[The Cincinnati Post]]'', he had enough saved to spend a year traveling around the world. Returning from China, he joined the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' in 1912. He married Ethel Worts on August 2, 1916, two weeks after he met her.&lt;ref name=web/&gt;

==Caspar Milquetoast quietly enters==
The titles of Webster's cartoons reflected the different situations, as in ''Our Boyhood Ambitions'' and ''Bridge''. In 1924, he moved to the ''New York World'' and soon after added ''The Timid Soul'' featuring [[Caspar Milquetoast]], a wimpy character whose name is derived from [[milk toast]]. Webster described Caspar Milquetoast as "the man who speaks softly and gets hit with a big stick". The modern dictionary definition of ''milquetoast'' (meaning a very shy or retiring person) comes from Webster's cartoons. 

In 1927 Webster trained himself to draw left-handed in three months after a severe case of arthritis impaired the use of his right hand. In 1931, the ''World'' folded, and that same year, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] published a collection of ''The Timid Soul'' reprints. Webster then went back to the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', where he then launched a ''Timid Soul'' [[Sunday strip]]. He alternated his various features throughout the week: Caspar Milquetoast was seen on both Sunday and Monday. Youth's glories (''The Thrill That Comes Once in a Lifetime'') and the downside (''Life's Darkest Moment'') appeared on Saturdays and Tuesdays. On Wednesday, ''The Unseen Audience'' offered satirical jabs at radio. ''How to Torture Your Husband (or Wife)'' was published each Thursday, and the week ended with ''Bridge'' on Fridays.&lt;ref name=web&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,776439,00.html "Average Man," ''Time'', Monday, November 26, 1945.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s, Webster lived at Shippan Point in [[Stamford, Connecticut]]. His assistant, Herb Roth, took over when Webster died in 1952. When Roth died the following year, the series came to an end with the last new drawing appearing in the ''New York Herald Tribune'' on April 4, 1953.

==Television==
On June 22, 1949, the [[DuMont Television Network]] adapted ''The Timid Soul'' to television as the premiere presentation of their ''Program Playhouse'' series. Caspar Milquetoast was portrayed by [[Ernest Truex]].
