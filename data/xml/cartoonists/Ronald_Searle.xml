'''Ronald William Fordham Searle''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Royal Designers for Industry|RDI]] (3 March 1920 – 30 December 2011&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;) was a British artist and [[satirical]] [[cartoonist]]. He is perhaps best remembered as the creator of [[St Trinian's School]] and for his collaboration with [[Geoffrey Willans]] on the [[Nigel Molesworth|Molesworth]] series.

==Biography==
[[File:In the Jungle - Self Portrait, Konyu, Thailand Jungle, July 1943 Art.IWMART1574776.jpg|thumb|left|''In the Jungle – Self Portrait, [[Hellfire Pass|Konyu]], Thailand Jungle, July 1943'']]

Searle was born in [[Cambridge]], England, where his father was a Post Office worker who repaired telephone lines.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; He started drawing at the age of five and left school (Central School – now [[Parkside Community College|Parkside School]]) at the age of 15. He trained at Cambridge College of Arts and Technology (now [[Anglia Ruskin University]]) for two years.

In April 1939, realizing that war was inevitable, he abandoned his art studies to enlist in the [[Royal Engineers]]. In January 1942, he was stationed in Singapore. After a month of fighting in Malaya, he was taken prisoner along with his cousin Tom Fordham Searle, when Singapore [[Battle of Singapore|fell to the Japanese]]. He spent the rest of the war a prisoner, first in [[Changi Prison]] and then in the Kwai jungle, working on the Siam-Burma [[Death Railway]].  Searle contracted both [[beri-beri]] and [[malaria]] during his incarceration, which included numerous beatings, and his weight dropped to less than 40 kilograms. He was liberated in late 1945 with the final defeat of the Japanese.  After the war, he served as a courtroom artist at the [[Nuremberg trials]].

He married the journalist [[Kaye Webb]] in 1947; they had twins, Kate and Johnny. In 1961, he moved to Paris, leaving his family; they were divorced in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Eccleshare |first=Julia |date=17 January 1996 |title=OBITUARY: Kaye Webb |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-kaye-webb-1324557.html  |newspaper= The Independent |access-date=29 January 2017  | quote=married ... thirdly 1946 Ronald Searle (one son, one daughter; marriage dissolved 1967)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he married Monica Koenig, a painter, theatre and jewellery designer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artslant.com/ny/events/show/12859-monica-searle-the-art-of-the-necklace Monica Searle: The Art of the Necklace]  ''Artslant – New York'' – Retrieved 5 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; After 1975, Searle and his wife lived and worked in the mountains of [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence|Haute Provence]].

His wife Monica died in July 2011 and Searle died on 30 December 2011, aged 91.

==Early work as war artist==
Although Searle published the first [[St Trinian's School|St Trinian's]] cartoon in the magazine ''[[Lilliput (magazine)|Lilliput]]'' in 1941, his professional career really begins with his documentation of the brutal camp conditions of his period as a prisoner-of-war of the Japanese in [[World War II]] in a series of drawings that he hid under the mattresses of prisoners dying of [[cholera]].  Searle recalled, "I desperately wanted to put down what was happening, because I thought if by any chance there was a record, even if I died, someone might find it and know what went on."  But Searle survived, along with approximately 300 of his drawings.  Liberated late in 1945, Searle returned to England where he published several of the drawings in fellow prisoner [[Russell Braddon]]'s ''The Naked Island''. Another of Searle's fellow prisoners later recounted, "If you can imagine something that weighs six stone or so, is on the point of death and has no qualities of the human condition that aren't revolting, calmly lying there with a pencil and a scrap of paper, drawing, you have some idea of the difference of temperament that this man had from the ordinary human being."&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art-obituaries/8989894/Ronald-Searle.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Ronald Searle | date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these drawings appear in his 1986 book, ''Ronald Searle: To the Kwai and Back, War Drawings 1939–1945''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author =Bill Maudlin |work=The New York Times |date=10 August 1986 |title= Sketches From Life and Death – review of ''To the Kwai – And Back'' |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE5D81338F933A2575BC0A960948260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Searle also wrote of his experiences as a prisoner, including the day he woke up to find a dead friend on either side of him, and a live snake underneath his head:
:"You can’t have that sort of experience without it directing the rest of your life.  I think that’s why I never really left my prison cell, because it gave me my measuring stick for the rest of my life... Basically all the people we loved and knew and grew up with simply became fertiliser for the nearest bamboo."

At least one of his drawings is on display at the Changi Museum and Chapel, Singapore, but the majority of his originals are in the permanent collection of the [[Imperial War Museum]], London, along with the works of other POW artists. The best known of these are [[John Mennie]], [[Jack Bridger Chalker]], [[Philip Meninsky]] and [[Ashley George Old]].

==Magazines, books, and films==
[[File:Sttrinians.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Modern Classics reissue of Ronald Searle's [[St Trinian's School|St Trinian's]] drawings]]
Searle produced an extraordinary volume of work during the 1950s, including drawings for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Holiday (magazine)|Holiday]]'' and ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/master-of-st-trinians-the-death-of-ronald-searle-6284587.html|title=Master of St Trinian's: The death of Ronald Searle|author=John Walsh|date=4 January 2012|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; His cartoons appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', the ''[[Sunday Express]]'' and the ''[[News Chronicle]]''. He compiled more St Trinian's books, which were based on his sister's school and other girls' schools in Cambridge. He collaborated with [[Geoffrey Willans]] on the Molesworth books (''Down With Skool!'', 1953, and ''How to be Topp'', 1954), and with [[Alex Atkinson]] on travel books. In addition to advertisements and posters, Searle drew the title backgrounds of the [[Sidney Gilliat]] and [[Frank Launder]] film ''[[The Happiest Days of Your Life]]''.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

After moving to Paris in 1961, he worked more on reportage for ''Life'' and ''Holiday'' and less on cartoons. He also continued to work in a broad range of media and created books (including his well-known cat books), animated films and sculpture for commemorative medals, both for the French Mint and the British Art Medal Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=Sculpture |publisher= [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |url= https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O111858/medal-antonio-pisanello-23rd-fidem-congress/ |title= Antonio Pisanello – 23rd FIDEM Congress Medal | accessdate=1 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bams.org.uk/medal-detail.php?medal=11 Medals] created for the British Art Medal Society&lt;/ref&gt; Searle did a considerable amount of designing for the cinema, and in 1965, he completed the opening, intermission and closing credits for the comedy film ''[[Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines]]'' as well as the 1969 film ''[[Monte Carlo or Bust!]]''. In 1975, the full-length cartoon ''[[Dick Deadeye, or Duty Done]]'' was released.  It is based on the character and songs from ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65446/Dick_Deadeye_or_Duty_Done.html "Dick Deadeye, or Duty Done (1975)"], Time Out Film Guide. Retrieved 7 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives==
In 2010, he gave about 2,200 of his works as permanent loans to [[Wilhelm Busch Museum]], [[Hanover]] (Germany), now renamed Deutsches Museum für Karikatur und Zeichenkunst. Previously the summer palace of [[George I of Great Britain|George I of Hanover]], this museum holds Searle's archives.

==Awards==
Searle received much recognition for his work, especially in America, including the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Advertising and Illustration Award in 1959 and 1965, the [[Reuben Award]] in 1960, their Illustration Award in 1980 and their Advertising Award in 1986 and 1987. Searle was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; In 2007, he was decorated with one of France's highest awards, the [[Légion d'honneur|Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur]], and in 2009, he received the German [[Lower Saxony Order of Merit]].

==Influence==
His work has had a great deal of influence, particularly on American cartoonists, including [[Pat Oliphant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Oliphant |first= Pat |author2=Katz, Harry L. |author3=Day, Sara  |year =1998 |title= Oliphant's Anthem |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e5OvrSJwPOUC&amp;pg=PA26 |pages =26 |accessdate =14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matt Groening]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbrLnoXdaLg | title=My Wasted Life – Matt Groening documentary |via=YouTube | accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilary Knight (illustrator)|Hilary Knight]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-05-23/entertainment/18102454_1_vincente-minnelli-absolutely-essential-eloise-hooray | location=New York | work=Daily News | first=Howard | last=Kissel | title=Plaza Sweetie Eloise, New York's Most Lovable Literary Brat, Makes A Comeback | date=23 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the animators of Disney's ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Amidi |first =Amid |title=Cartoon modern: style and design in fifties animation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aih6tQDk5fYC&amp;pg=PT160 |accessdate =14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an early influence on [[John Lennon]]'s drawing style which featured in the books ''[[In His Own Write]]'' and ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =John Lennon Interview – Beatles Interview Database |url=http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1968.0606.beatles.html |accessdate=14 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
