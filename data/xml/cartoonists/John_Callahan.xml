==Accident and career==
Callahan became a [[quadriplegic ]] in an auto accident at 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The accident happened in Callahan's car after a day of drinking; his car was being driven by a man with whom he was bar hopping.

Following his accident, he became a cartoonist, drawing by clutching a pen between both hands. His visual artistic style was simple and often rough, although still legible. It has been likened to that of [[William Steig]], [[James Thurber]], [[Richard Condie]], and [[Ben Wicks]].

Callahan's [[cartoons]] dealt with subjects often considered [[taboo]]. His [[black humor]] may be exemplified by the title of his "quasi-memoir," ''Will the Real John Callahan Please Stand Up?''. The subject matter and treatment of his cartoons shares something with the work of [[Charles Addams]], [[Gahan Wilson]], and especially [[Charles Rodrigues]], although it is much more aggressive than even the ''[[Playboy]]'' cartoons by these cartoonists.

From 1983 until his death 27 years later, Callahan's work appeared in the Portland newspaper ''[[Willamette Week]]''. The controversial nature of his cartoons occasionally led to boycotts and protests against the paper.

Callahan scoffed at the reactions of critics who labeled his work [[Political_correctness|politically incorrect]], while he delighted in the positive reactions he received from fans with disabilities. "My only compass for whether I’ve gone too far is the reaction I get from people in wheelchairs, or with hooks for hands." Callahan said. "Like me, they are fed up with people who presume to speak for the disabled. All the pity and the patronizing. That’s what is truly detestable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two animated cartoon series have been based on Callahan's cartoons: ''[[Pelswick]]'', a children's show on [[Nickelodeon]]; and ''[[John Callahan's Quads!|Quads]]'', a Canadian-Australian co-production, which retains the violence, ''joie de vivre'', and political incorrectness of his cartoons.

Friends said Callahan realized that his cartooning was a form of emotional ventilation, which led to him pursuing a master's degree in counseling at [[Portland State University]] to understand the machinations. However, his deteriorating health prevented him from finishing his first term.&lt;ref&gt;Dungca, Nicole; and Molly Hottle, "Cartoonist kept humor to the end", ''The Oregonian'', 26 July 2010, p. B6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Dutch_people|Dutch]] film maker [[Simone de Vries]] made a documentary on Callahan, 'Raak me waar ik voelen kan' ('Touch me where I can feel').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollanddoc.nl/hollanddoc/kijk-luister/documentaire/r/Raak-me-waar-ik-voelen-kan.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516141252/http://www.hollanddoc.nl/hollanddoc/kijk-luister/documentaire/r/Raak-me-waar-ik-voelen-kan.html |archivedate=2011-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Callahan died on July 24, 2010, following surgery for chronic [[bed sores]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother stated the causes of his death were complications of quadriplegia and respiratory problems.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

A biographical movie, ''[[Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot]]'' starring [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Jack Black]] and [[Jonah Hill]] and directed by [[Gus van Sant]], was released in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/movies/joaquin-phoenix-rooney-mara-he-wont-get-far-on-foot.html |title=New Trailer: ‘Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot’ |work=[[New York Times]] |author=Bruce Fretts |date=January 16, 2018 |accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other careers==

===Graphic art===
John Callahan worked on nudes and a portrait project, shown in several galleries throughout its progression.

===Songwriting===
Callahan was also a [[songwriter]]. He released a CD, ''Purple Winos in the Rain'', in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/purple-winos-in-the-rain-mw0000454838|title=Purple Winos in the Rain - John Callahan - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote and composed his own lyrics and sang and played [[harmonica]] and [[ukulele]]. The record was released on BoneClone Records and produced by [[blues]] musician [[Terry Robb]], with a special [[cameo appearance]] by [[Tom Waits]]. Callahan personally illustrated the album cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/purple-winos-in-the-rain-mw0000454838/credits|title=Purple Winos in the Rain - John Callahan - Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Independent]]'' of [[London]] calls his songs "Beautiful, but dark." He wrote all the music and lyrics himself and was backed up by many notable musicians. A Dutch film crew recorded the studio sessions in which Callahan played a simplified piano version of "Roll Away The Day."

==Personal life==
John Callahan was adopted as an infant and grew up in [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]], 80 miles east of Portland, with five siblings.  He attended a [[Roman Catholic]] high school.&lt;ref&gt;

In his book, Callahan said, "I can imagine myself sitting on that bench and thinking Boy, this will be called child molestation twenty years from now."

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He began drinking at the age of twelve.  "I used the alcohol to hide the pain of the abuse," Callahan has said.  After the car accident that caused his spinal cord injury, he went through extensive rehabilitation.  At the age of 27, he gave up drinking alcohol.  He made his home in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;
