== Biography ==
Turner was raised in [[Oakland, California]], the youngest child of a [[Pullman porter]] father and a homemaker and nurse mother.&lt;ref name=Cavna/&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo-obit&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/comics/morrie-turner-dies-at-90-pioneering-wee-pals-cartoonist/2014/01/28/181143ea-883b-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267_story.html | title= Morrie Turner dies at 90; pioneering ‘Wee Pals’ cartoonist | work= [[The Washington Post]] | first= Adam | last= Bernstein | date= January 28, 2014 | accessdate= 2014-05-01 | archivedate= May 1, 2014 | archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6PEko3Eam?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/comics/morrie-turner-dies-at-90-pioneering-wee-pals-cartoonist/2014/01/28/181143ea-883b-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267_story.html | deadurl= no | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Cole Elementary School and [[McClymonds High School]] in Oakland and [[Berkeley High School (California)|Berkeley High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Morrie-Turner-pioneering-Wee-Pals-cartoonist-5183290.php|title=Morrie Turner - pioneering Wee Pals cartoonist - dies|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/morrie-turner-38 |title= Morrie Turner |publisher= The HistoryMakers.org |date= April 6, 2004 |access-date= December 13, 2017 |archivedate= December 14, 2017 |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20171214005149/http://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/morrie-turner-38 |deadurl= no |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner got his first training in cartooning via a correspondence course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= |first= |year=1961 |title= California's cartooning cop |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4uK_KEF-KT8C&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |journal= Ebony |volume= Vol. 16, No. 12 |page=75 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During [[World War II]], where he served as a mechanic with [[Tuskegee Airmen]],&lt;ref name=Cavna /&gt; his illustrations appeared in the newspaper ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]''. After the war, while working for the [[Oakland Police Department]], he created the comic strip ''Baker's Helper''.&lt;ref name=Lambiek&gt;[http://www.lambiek.net/artists/t/turner_morrie.htm Morrie Turner] at the [[Lambiek Comiclopedia]].

When Turner began questioning why there were no minorities in cartoons, his mentor, ''[[Peanuts]]'' cartoonist [[Charles M. Schulz]], suggested he create one.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Martha. [http://www.contracostatimes.com/breaking-news/ci_25005288/morrie-turner-pioneering-wee-pals-cartoonist-dies-at "Morrie Turner: Pioneering 'Wee Pals' cartoonist, dies at 90,"] ''Contra Costa Times'' (Jan. 27, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Morris' first attempt, ''Dinky Fellas'', featured an all-black cast, but found publication in only one newspaper, the ''[[Chicago Defender]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/11/PKIB19H7KS.DTL&amp;type=art|title=Wee Pals retrospective at S.F. library|author=Jesse Hamlin|date=2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner integrated the strip, renaming it ''Wee Pals'', and in 1965 it became the first American syndicated comic strip to have a cast of diverse ethnicity.&lt;ref name=Cavna /&gt; Although the strip was only originally carried by five newspapers, it was picked up by more than 100 after [[Civil Rights]] leader [[Martin Luther King]]'s assassination in 1968.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.creators.com/comics/wee-pals-about.html |title=About Morrie Turner | publisher=Creators.com | accessdate= January 27, 2014| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150427110906/http://www.creators.com/comics/wee-pals-about.html | archivedate= April 27, 2015| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 Turner became a co-chairman of the [[White House Conference on Children and Youth]].&lt;ref name=wapo-obit /&gt;

Turner appeared as a guest on the [[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (season 6)|May 14, 1973, episode]] of ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'', where he showed the host pictures he had drawn of several of his neighbors. Turner also presented a clip from his ''Kid Power'' animated series, which was airing Saturday mornings on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] at the time.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  As well, during the 1972-73 television season, ''Wee Pals on the Go'' was aired by ABC's [[owned-and-operated station]] in [[San Francisco]], [[KGO-TV]]. This Sunday morning show featured child actors who portrayed the main characters of Turner's comic strip: Nipper, Randy, Sybil, Connie and Oliver. With and through the kids, Turner explored venues, activities and objects such as a candy factory and a train locomotive.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

As the comic strip continued, Turner added characters of more and more ethnicities, as well as a child with a physical disability.

During the [[Vietnam War]], Turner and five other members of the [[National Cartoonist Society]] traveled to Vietnam, where they spent a month drawing more than 3,000 caricatures of service people.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

For concerts by the Bay Area Little Symphony of [[Oakland, California]], Turner drew pictures to the music and of children in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bamusic.org/Bay_Area_Little_Symphony/Description/Morrie_Turner/morrie_turner.html|title=Morrie Turner|last=Gibson|first=Michael P.|website=www.bamusic.org|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner launched the first in a series of Summer Art exhibitions at the [[East Oakland Youth Development Center]] (EOYDC) on June 10, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alamedamagazine.com/Alameda-Magazine/July-August-2009/EOYDC-A-Beacon-for-Oakland-Youth/|title=EOYDC:  A Beacon for Oakland Youth - Alameda Magazine - July-August 2009 - Alameda, California|website=www.alamedamagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, cartoonist [[Bil Keane]] created the ''[[Family Circus]]'' character Morrie, a playmate of Billy and the only recurring black character in the strip, based on Turner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Jeff|title=Morrie Turner and the Kids|journal=[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]]|issue=November–December 2009|url=http://www.believermag.com/issues/200911/?read=article_chang|accessdate=March 18, 2013|archivedate=April 10, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130410132616/http://www.believermag.com/issues/200911/?read=article_chang|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
