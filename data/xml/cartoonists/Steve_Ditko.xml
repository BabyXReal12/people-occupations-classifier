'''Stephen J. Ditko'''&lt;ref name=bb14&gt;{{cite book| last=Bell|first=Blake|title=Strange and Stranger: The World of Steve Ditko|publisher = [[Fantagraphics Books]] | location = Seattle, Washington|year= 2008|page= 14|isbn= 1-56097-921-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɪ|t|k|oʊ}}; November 2, 1927 – c. June 29, 2018) was an American [[comics artist]] and writer best known as the artist and co-creator, with [[Stan Lee]], of the [[Marvel Comics]] superheroes [[Spider-Man]] and [[Doctor Strange]].

Ditko studied under [[Batman]] artist [[Jerry Robinson]] at the [[Cartoonist and Illustrators School]] in New York City. He began his professional career in 1953, working in the studio of [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], beginning as an inker and coming under the influence of artist [[Mort Meskin]]. During this time, he then began his long association with [[Charlton Comics]], where he did work in the genres of science fiction, horror, and mystery. He also co-created the [[superhero]] [[Captain Atom]] in 1960.

During the 1950s, Ditko also drew for [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], a forerunner of Marvel Comics. He went on to contribute much significant work to Marvel. In 1966, after being the exclusive artist on ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and the "Doctor Strange" feature in ''[[Strange Tales]]'', Ditko left Marvel for reasons he never specified.

Ditko continued to work for Charlton and also [[DC Comics]], including a revamp of the long-running character the [[Blue Beetle]], and creating or co-creating the [[Question (comics)|Question]], the [[Creeper (comics)|Creeper]], [[Shade, the Changing Man|Shade the Changing Man]], and [[Hawk and Dove]]. Ditko also began contributing to small independent publishers, where he created [[Mr. A]], a hero reflecting the influence of [[Ayn Rand]]'s philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. Ditko largely declined to give interviews, saying he preferred to communicate through his work.

Ditko was inducted into the comics industry's [[Jack Kirby Hall of Fame]] in 1990, and into the [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame]] in 1994.

==Early life==

Stephen J. Ditko was born on November 2, 1927 in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' #1636 (December 2007) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; the son of first-generation Americans of Slovak&lt;ref name=bbend1&gt;Bell, ''Strange and Stranger'', Endnotes, p.1, citing 1920 and [[1930 United States Census]] data. The family lists itself as [[Czechoslovakia]]n in the latter census, following the dissolution of [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; descent: Stephen Ditko, an artistically talented [[carpenter|master carpenter]] at a [[steel mill]], and Anna, a [[homemaker]]. The second-eldest child in a working-class family, he was preceded by sister Anna Marie,&lt;ref name=bbend1 /&gt; and followed by sister Elizabeth and brother Patrick.&lt;ref name=bb14 /&gt; Inspired by his father's love of newspaper [[comic strips]], particularly [[Hal Foster]]'s ''[[Prince Valiant]]'', Ditko found his interest in comics accelerated by the introduction of [[superhero]] [[Batman]] in 1940, and by [[Will Eisner]]'s ''[[Spirit (comics)|The Spirit]]'', which appeared in a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]-sized comic-book insert in Sunday newspapers.&lt;ref name=bb15&gt;Bell, ''Strange and Stranger'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Ditko in junior high school was part of a group of students who crafted wooden models of German airplanes to aid civilian [[World War II]] aircraft-spotters.&lt;ref name=bb15 /&gt; Upon graduating from Johnstown High School in 1945,&lt;ref name=bb15 /&gt; he enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]] on October 26, 1945,&lt;ref name=bbend1 /&gt; and did military service in postwar Germany, where he drew comics for an Army newspaper.&lt;ref name=bb15 /&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Thing,The,Ditko1stcover.jpg|thumb|''The Thing'' #12 (Feb. 1954), Ditko's first published comic-book cover]]
Following his discharge, Ditko learned that his idol, Batman artist [[Jerry Robinson]], was teaching at the Cartoonists and Illustrators School (later the [[School of Visual Arts]]) in New York City. Moving there in 1950, he enrolled in the art school under the [[G.I. Bill]].&lt;ref name="Bell16"&gt;Bell, ''Strange and Stranger'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson found the young student "a very hard worker who really focused on his drawing"&lt;ref name="AE39"&gt;Jerry Robinson interview, ''[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]'' #38 (Aug. 2004), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and someone who "could work well with other writers as well as write his own stories and create his own characters",&lt;ref name="AE39" /&gt; and he helped Ditko acquire a scholarship for the following year.&lt;ref name="Bell19"&gt;Bell, ''Strange and Stranger'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; "He was in my class for two years, four or five days a week, five hours a night. It was very intense."&lt;ref name="student"&gt;[[Jerry Robinson|Robinson, Jerry]], "Student and Teacher", in Yoe, Craig, ed. ''The Art of Ditko'' ([[IDW Publishing]], January 2010), {{ISBN|978-1-60010-542-5}}, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson, who invited artists and editors to speak with his class, once brought in [[Stan Lee]], then editor of [[Marvel Comics]]' 1950s precursor [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]] and, "I think that was when Stan first saw Steve's work."&lt;ref name="student" /&gt;

Ditko began professionally illustrating comic books in early 1953, drawing writer Bruce Hamilton's science-fiction story "Stretching Things" for the [[Key Publications]] imprint [[Stanmor Publications]], which sold the story to [[Ajax/Farrell]], where it finally found publication in ''Fantastic Fears'' #5 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1954).&lt;ref name="bb20"&gt;Bell, ''Strange and Stranger'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=244841|title= ''Fantastic Fears'' #5|publisher= Grand Comics Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ditko's first published work was his second professional story, the six-page "Paper Romance" in ''Daring Love'' #1 (Oct. 1953),&lt;ref name="bb20" /&gt; published by the Key imprint [[Gillmor Magazines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/241499/ ''Daring Love'' #1] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterward, Ditko found work at the studio of writer-artists [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], who had created [[Captain America]] and other characters. Beginning as an inker on backgrounds, Ditko was soon working with and learning from [[Mort Meskin]], an artist whose work he had long admired. "Meskin was fabulous," Ditko once recalled. "I couldn't believe the ease with which he drew: strong compositions, loose pencils, yet complete; detail without clutter. I loved his stuff".&lt;ref&gt;Theakston, ''Steve Ditko Reader'', p. 3 (unnumbered)&lt;/ref&gt; Ditko's known assistant work includes aiding inker Meskin on the Jack Kirby pencil work of [[Harvey Comics]]' ''[[Captain 3-D]]'' #1 (Dec. 1953).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=10952 ''Captain 3-D'' #1 (Dec. 1953)] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt; For his own third published story, Ditko penciled and inked the six-page "A Hole in His Head" in ''Black Magic'' vol. 4, #3 (Dec. 1953), published by Simon &amp; Kirby's [[Crestwood Publications]] imprint [[Prize Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=10906 ''Black Magic''&lt;nowiki&gt; vol. 4, #3 [27] (Dec. 1953)&lt;/nowiki&gt;] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt;

Ditko then began a long association with the [[Derby, Connecticut]] publisher [[Charlton Comics]], a low-budget division of a company best known for song-lyric magazines. Beginning with the cover of ''[[The Thing!]]'' #12 (Feb. 1954) and the eight-page [[vampire]] story "Cinderella" in that issue, Ditko would continue to work intermittently for Charlton until the company's demise in 1986, producing science fiction, [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[mystery fiction|mystery]] stories, as well as co-creating [[Captain Atom]], with writer [[Joe Gill]], in ''[[Space Adventures (comics)|Space Adventures]]'' #33 (March 1960).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael |editor-last=Dolan |editor-first=Hannah |chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 99 |quote = Captain Atom was born in a tale by artist Steve Ditko and writer Joe Gill.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first went on hiatus from the company, and comics altogether, in mid-1954, when he contracted [[tuberculosis]] and returned to his parents' home in Johnstown to recuperate.&lt;ref name=strangesuspense&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Bell |editor-first=Blake | title=Strange Suspense: The Steve Ditko Archives Vol. 1| publisher=Fantagraphics Books|year= 2009|location= Seattle, Washington|page= 10|isbn= 978-1-60699-289-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvel Comics===
After he recovered and moved back to New York City in late 1955,&lt;ref name=strangesuspense /&gt; Ditko began drawing for [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s precursor of [[Marvel Comics]], beginning with the four-page "There'll Be Some Changes Made" in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #33 (April 1956); this debut tale would be reprinted in Marvel's ''Curse of the Weird'' #4 (March 1994). Ditko would go on to contribute a large number of stories, many considered classic, to Atlas/Marvel's ''[[Strange Tales]]'' and the newly launched ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'', ''[[Strange Worlds]]'', ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' and ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'', issues of which would typically open with a Kirby-drawn monster story, followed by one or two twist-ending thrillers or sci-fi tales drawn by [[Don Heck]], [[Paul Reinman]], or [[Joe Sinnott]], all capped by an often-surreal, sometimes self-reflexive short by Ditko and writer-editor [[Stan Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Brevoort|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom Brevoort |editor-last=Gilbert |editor-first=Laura |chapter=1950s |title=Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London |page = 73|isbn =978-0756641238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These Lee-Ditko short stories proved so popular that ''Amazing Adventures'' was reformatted to feature such stories exclusively beginning with issue #7 (Dec. 1961), when the comic was rechristened ''Amazing Adult Fantasy'', a name intended to reflect its more "sophisticated" nature, as likewise the new tagline "The magazine that respects your intelligence". Lee in 2009 described these "short, five-page filler strips that Steve and I did together", originally "placed in any of our comics that had a few extra pages to fill", as "odd fantasy tales that I'd dream up with [[O. Henry]]-type endings." Giving an early example of what would later be known as the "[[Marvel Method]]" of writer-artist collaboration, Lee said, "All I had to do was give Steve a one-line description of the plot and he'd be off and running. He'd take those skeleton outlines I had given him and turn them into classic little works of art that ended up being far cooler than I had any right to expect."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]], "Introduction", in Yoe, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

====Creation of Spider-Man====
After Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Stan Lee obtained permission from publisher [[martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] to create a new "ordinary teen" superhero named "Spider-Man",&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Stan, and Mair, George. ''Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee'' (Fireside, 2002), p.130. {{ISBN|0-684-87305-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee originally approached his leading artist, [[Jack Kirby]]. Kirby told Lee about his own 1950s character conception, variously called the Silver Spider and Spiderman, in which an orphaned boy finds a magic ring that gives him super powers. Comics historian [[Greg Theakston]] says Lee and Kirby "immediately sat down for a story conference" and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages. "A day or two later", Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, and, as Lee recalled, "I hated the way he was doing it. Not that he did it badly&amp;nbsp;— it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic".&lt;ref&gt;Theakston, Greg. ''The Steve Ditko Reader'' (Pure Imagination, Brooklyn, New York, 2002; {{ISBN|1-56685-011-8}}), p. 12 (unnumbered)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual motif Lee found satisfactory,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 87: "Deciding that his new character would have spider-like powers, [Stan] Lee commissioned Jack Kirby to work on the first story. Unfortunately, Kirby's version of Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker proved too heroic, handsome, and muscular for Lee's everyman hero. Lee turned to Steve Ditko, the regular artist on Amazing Adult Fantasy, who designed a skinny, awkward teenager with glasses."&lt;/ref&gt; although Lee would later replace Ditko's original cover with one penciled by Kirby. Ditko said, "The Spider-Man pages Stan showed me were nothing like the (eventually) published character. In fact, the only drawings of Spider-Man were on the splash &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[i.e.]], page 1] and at the end [where] Kirby had the guy leaping at you with a web gun... Anyway, the first five pages took place in the home, and the kid finds a ring and turns into Spider-Man."&lt;ref&gt;Theakston, ''Steve Ditko Reader'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Ditko also recalled that, "One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn't have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn't sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character's face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character...."&lt;ref&gt;Ditko, Steve. "Jack Kirby's Spider-Man", ''Robin Snyder's History of Comics'' #5 (May 1990). Reprinted in [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]], ed., ''Alter Ego: The Comic Book Artist Collection''. Raleigh, North Carolina: [[TwoMorrows Publishing]], 2001, p. 56. {{ISBN|978-1-893905-06-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much earlier, in a rare contemporaneous account, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in ''Comic Fan'' #2 (Summer 1965): "Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist &amp; spider signal". He added he would continue drawing Spider-Man "[i]f nothing better comes along."&lt;ref name=comicfan2&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=April 30, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430081615/http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/artist/arcomicf.html |author=Ditko interview |title=Steve Ditko – A Portrait of the Master |url=http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/artist/arcomicf.html |publisher=''Comic Fan'' #2 (Larry Herndon, pub.) via Ditko.Comics.org (Blake Bell, ed.) |date=Summer 1965 |accessdate=April 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes}} Additional , February 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he expressed to the fanzine ''Voice of Comicdom'', regarding a poll of "Best Liked" fan-created comics, "It seems a shame, since comics themselves have so little variety of stories and styles that you would deliberately restrict your own creative efforts to professional comics['] shallow range. What is 'Best Liked' by most readers is what they are most familiar in seeing and any policy based on readers likes has to end up with a lot of look-a-like ([[sic]]) strips. You have a great opportunity to show everyone a whole new range of ideas, unlimited types of stories and styles—why FLUB it!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/artist/arvoc4le.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227184226/http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/artist/arvoc4le.html |archivedate=December 27, 2007 |first=Steve |last=Ditko |title=Editor's Mailbox |publisher=''Voice of Comicdom'' #4 (Bob Metz, ed.) via Ditko.Comics.org (Blake Bell, ed.) |date=April 1965 |deadurl=yes}} Punctuation verbatim.

From 1958 to either 1966,&lt;ref name=ditkostanton /&gt; or 1968&lt;ref name=theakston-reader-p14 /&gt; (accounts differ), Ditko shared a [[Manhattan]] studio at 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue with noted fetish artist [[Eric Stanton]], an art-school classmate. When either artist was under deadline pressure, it was not uncommon for them to pitch in and help the other with his assignment.&lt;ref name=ditkostanton&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell |first=Blake |url=http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/crea/crerstan.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501191157/http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/crea/crerstan.html |archivedate=May 1, 2008 |title=Ditko &amp; Stanton |publisher=Ditko Looked Up |deadurl=yes}}  Additional .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theakston, ''The Steve Ditko Reader'', pp. 13–15 (unnumbered, pp. 14–15 misordered as pp. 16 &amp; 14)&lt;/ref&gt; Ditko biographer Blake Bell, without citing sources, said, "At one time in history, Ditko denied ever touching Stanton's work, even though Stanton himself said they would each dabble in each other's art; mainly spot-inking",&lt;ref name=ditkostanton /&gt; and the introduction to one book of Stanton's work says, "Eric Stanton drew his pictures in [[India ink]], and they were then hand-coloured&lt;!--as spelled in source--&gt; by Ditko".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Riemschneider | first = Burkhard | title = Eric Stanton: For the Man Who Knows His Place | publisher = [[Taschen|Benedikt Taschen Verlag]] | year = 1997|location= Cologne, Germany| page = 4 (unnumbered) | isbn =  978-3-8228-8169-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1988 interview with Theakston, Stanton recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was "almost nil", he and Ditko had "worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands".&lt;ref name=theakston-reader-p14&gt;Theakston, ''Steve Ditko Reader'', p. 14 (unnumbered, misordered as page 16)&lt;/ref&gt;

Spider-Man debuted in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (Aug. 1962), the final issue of that science-fiction/fantasy anthology series. When the issue proved to be a top seller, Spider-Man was given his own series, ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rhoades|first=Shirrel|page=81|title=A Complete History of American Comic Books|publisher= [[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang Publishing]]|year=2008|location= Pieterlen and Bern, Switzerland|isbn=978-1-4331-0107-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 91: "Thanks to a flood of fan mail, Spider-Man was awarded his own title six months after his first appearance. ''Amazing Spider-Man'' began as a bimonthly title, but was quickly promoted to a monthly."&lt;/ref&gt; Lee and Ditko's collaboration on the series saw the creation of many of the character's best known antagonists including [[Doctor Octopus]] in issue #3 (July 1963);&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 93: "Dr. Octopus shared many traits with Peter Parker. They were both shy, both interested in science, and both had trouble relating to women...Otto Octavius even looked like a grown up Peter Parker.

Writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko had no way of knowing how true that statement would prove to be in the coming years."&lt;/ref&gt; Ditko eventually demanded credit for the plotting he was contributing under the [[Marvel Method]].

One of the most celebrated issues of the Lee-Ditko run is #33 (Feb. 1966), the third part of the story arc "[[If This Be My Destiny...!]]", and featuring the dramatic scene of Spider-Man, through force of will and thoughts of family, escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery.

====Doctor Strange and other characters====

After drawing the final issue of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (#6, March 1963), Ditko created&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| story = "Toyland": "Martin Goodman/Stan Lee"| title= The Avenging Mind| publisher= Robin Snyder and Steve Ditko| date=April 2008| writer= Ditko, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stan Lee letter to Jerry Bails, January 9, 1963 (first paragraph of P.S.), published in ''[[The Comic Reader]]'' (16) February 23, 1963. Letter reprinted [http://themarvelageofcomics.tumblr.com/post/16306907460/a-letter-written-by-stan-lee-to-super-fan-dr online]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140409065636/http://themarvelageofcomics.tumblr.com/post/16306907460/a-letter-written-by-stan-lee-to-super-fan-dr Archived] from the original on April 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[supernatural]] hero [[Doctor Strange]], in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July 1963).&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 93: "When Dr. Strange first appeared in ''Strange Tales'' #110, it was only clear that he dabbled in black magic and had the ability to project his consciousness into an astral form that could leave his physical body."&lt;/ref&gt; Ditko and Lee shortly thereafter relaunched a [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] series as a short feature in the [[anthology]] ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'', beginning with issue #60 (Oct. 1964). Ditko, inked by [[George Roussos]], penciled the feature through #67 (May 1965). Ditko designed the Hulk's primary antagonist, the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], in #62 (Dec. 1964).

Ditko also penciled the [[Iron Man]] feature in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #47–49 (Nov. 1963&amp;nbsp;– Jan. 1964), with various inkers. The first of these debuted the initial version of Iron Man's modern red-and-golden armor, though whether Ditko or cover-penciler and principal character designer [[Jack Kirby]] designed the costume is uncertain.

Though often overshadowed by his ''Amazing Spider-Man'' work, Ditko's "Doctor Strange" artwork has been equally acclaimed, for its [[surrealism|surrealistic]] mystical landscapes and increasingly psychedelic visuals that helped make the feature a favorite of college students. "People who read 'Doctor Strange' thought people at Marvel must be heads [i.e. drug users]," recalled then-associate editor and former Doctor Strange writer [[Roy Thomas]] in 1971, "because they had had similar experiences high on [[Psilocybin mushroom|mushrooms]]. But ... I don't use hallucinogens, nor do I think any artists do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |authorlink=Robin Green (producer) |last=Green |first=Robin |url=http://www.reocities.com/area51/Chamber/8346/rs91.facefront.1.html |title=Face Front!

Eventually Lee &amp; Ditko would take Strange into ever-more-abstract realms. In an epic 17-issue story arc in ''Strange Tales'' #130–146 (March 1965 – July 1966), Lee and Ditko introduced the cosmic character [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], who personified the universe and was depicted as a silhouette whose outlines are filled with the cosmos.&lt;ref name=st134&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/19306/ ''Strange Tales'' #134] at the Grand Comics Database: "Indexer Notes: Part 5 of 17. First mention of Eternity. Strange would finally find it in ''Strange Tales'' #138 (November 1965)".&lt;/ref&gt; As historian Bradford W. Wright describes,

{{quote|Steve Ditko contributed some of his most surrealistic work to the comic book and gave it a disorienting, hallucinogenic quality. Dr. Strange's adventures take place in bizarre worlds and twisting dimensions that resembled [[Salvador Dalí]] paintings.  ... Inspired by the pulp-fiction magicians of Stan Lee's childhood as well as by contemporary [[Beat Generation|Beat]] culture. Dr. Strange remarkably predicted the youth [[counterculture]]'s fascination with Eastern mysticism and [[psychedelia]]. Never among Marvel's more popular or accessible characters, Dr. Strange still found a niche among an audience seeking a challenging alternative to more conventional superhero fare.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Bradford W. ''Comic Book Nation: Transformation of a Youth Culture'', Baltimore, Maryland: [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2001. {{ISBN|0-8018-7450-5}}. p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[cartoonist]] and [[fine artist]] [[Seth (cartoonist)|Seth]] in 2003 described Ditko's style as "oddball for mainstream comics. Whereas Kirby's stuff clearly appealed to a boy's sensibility because there was so much raw power, Ditko's work was really delicate and cartoony. There was a sense of design to it. You can always recognize anything that Ditko designed because it's always flowery. There is a lot of embroidered detail in the art, which is almost psychedelic."&lt;ref&gt;Heer, Jeet. [http://www.jeetheer.com/comics/ditko.htm "Steve Ditko"], ''[[The National Post]]'', May 3, 2003, via JeetHeer.com. [https://www.webcitation.org/5snSoIIJ4?url=http://www.jeetheer.com/comics/ditko.htm WebCitation archive].&lt;/ref&gt;

Whichever feature he drew, Ditko's idiosyncratic, cleanly detailed, instantly recognizable art style, emphasizing mood and [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], found great favor with readers. The character of Spider-Man and his troubled personal life meshed well with Ditko's own interests, which Lee eventually acknowledged by giving the artist plotting credits on the latter part of their 38-issue run. But after four years on the title, Ditko left Marvel;&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 117: "To this day, no one really knows why Ditko quit. Bullpen sources reported he was unhappy with the way Lee scripted some of his plots, using a tongue-in-cheek approach to stories Ditko wanted handled seriously."&lt;/ref&gt; he and Lee had not been on speaking terms for some time, with art and editorial changes handled through intermediaries.&lt;ref name=tomsinclair&gt;{{cite news |last=Sinclair |first=Tom |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,458355_2,00.html |title=Still a Marvel! |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=June 20, 2003 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w0kCRgq4?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,458355_2,00.html |archivedate=January 25, 2011 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The details of the rift remain uncertain, even to Lee, who confessed in 2003, "I never really knew Steve on a personal level."&lt;ref name=tomsinclair /&gt; Ditko later claimed it was Lee who broke off contact and disputed the long-held belief&lt;ref name=ross&gt;[[Jonathan Ross|Ross, Jonathan]], ''In Search of Steve Ditko'', [[BBC Four]]&lt;/ref&gt; that the disagreement was over the true identity of the [[Green Goblin]]: "Stan never knew what he was getting in my Spider-Man stories and covers until after [production manager] [[Sol Brodsky]] took the material from me ... so there couldn't have been any disagreement or agreement, no exchanges ... no problems between us concerning the Green Goblin or anything else from before issue #25 to my final issues".&lt;ref name=wiz&gt;Lawrence, Christopher, "Who Is Steve Ditko?", ''Wizard'' #124 (Jan. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Spider-Man successor artist [[John Romita Sr.|John Romita]], in a 2010 [[Deposition (law)|deposition]], recalled that Lee and Ditko "ended up not being able to work together because they disagreed on almost everything, cultural, social, historically, everything, they disagreed on characters...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B_lZovnpi13JNWQ5MDJmOTgtZDMzYy00MzI3LTllYjctNmM0ZWE4NjgyOWEx&amp;hl=en_US | title=Confidential Videotaped Deposition of John V.

Regardless, said Lee in 2007, "Quite a few years ago I met him up at the Marvel offices when I was last in New York. And we spoke; he's a hell of a nice guy and it was very pleasant. ...

===Charlton and DC Comics===
Back at Charlton—where the page rate was low but creators were allowed greater freedom—Ditko worked on such characters as the [[Blue Beetle]] (1967–1968),&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 123: "After Ted Kord assumed the scarab as Blue Beetle in a back-up feature of ''Captain Atom'' #83, writer/artist Steve Ditko and co-writer 'D.C. Glanzman' (who was actually Ditko) launched the Blue Beetle into his own series."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Question (comics)|Question]] (1967–1968), and [[Captain Atom]] (1965–1967), returning to the character he'd co-created in 1960. In addition, in 1966 and 1967, he drew 16 stories, most of them written by [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], for [[Warren Publishing]]'s horror-comic magazines ''[[Creepy (magazine)|Creepy]]'' and ''[[Eerie]]'', generally using an [[wash (visual arts)|ink-wash]] technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= How to Draw Chiller Monsters, Werewolves, Vampires, and Zombies|last= Spurlock |first= J.

In 1967, Ditko gave his Objectivist ideas ultimate expression in the form of [[Mr. A]], published in [[Wally Wood]]'s independent title ''[[witzend]]'' #&amp;nbsp;3. Ditko's hard line against criminals was controversial{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} and he continued to produce Mr. A stories and one-pagers until the end of the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Ditko returned to Mr. A in 2000 and in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Ditko moved to [[DC Comics]] in 1968, where he co-created the [[Creeper (comics)|Creeper]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #73 (April 1968) with [[Don Segall]], under editor [[Murray Boltinoff]].&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 129 "Writer/artist Steve Ditko and co-scripter Don Segall gave [character Jack Ryder] more than the last laugh as the garishly garbed Creeper, one of DC's quirkiest protagonists."&lt;/ref&gt; DC Comics writer and executive [[Paul Levitz]] observed that Ditko's art on the ''Creeper'' stories made "them look unlike anything else being published by DC at the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Paul Levitz|last=Levitz|first= Paul|chapter= The Silver Age 1956–1970|title= 75 Years of DC Comics The Art of Modern Mythmaking|publisher= [[Taschen]]|year=2010|location= Cologne, Germany|ISBN= 9783836519816|page= 268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ditko co-created the team [[Hawk and Dove]] in ''Showcase'' #75 (June 1968), with writer [[Steve Skeates]].&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 130 "Brothers Hank and Don Hall were complete opposites, yet writer/artist Steve Ditko with scripter Steve Skeates made sure the siblings shared a desire to battle injustice as Hawk and Dove."&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, he penciled the lead story, written and inked by Wally Wood, in Wood's early mature-audience, [[Alternative media|independent-comics]] publication ''[[Heroes, Inc. Presents Cannon]]'' (1969).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

Ditko's stay at DC was short—he would work on all six issues of the Creeper's own title, ''Beware the Creeper'' (June 1968 – April 1969), though leaving midway through the final one—and the reasons for his departure uncertain. But while at DC, Ditko recommended Charlton staffer [[Dick Giordano]] to the company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2007_09_11.html |authorlink=Mark Evanier |last=Evanier |first=Mark |title=Ditko Doc |date=September 11, 2007 |publisher="P.O.V.

From this time up through the mid-1970s, Ditko worked exclusively for Charlton and various [[alternative comics|small press/independent]] publishers. [[Frank McLaughlin (artist)|Frank McLaughlin]], Charlton's art director during this period, describes Ditko as living "in a local hotel in [[Derby, Connecticut|Derby]] for a while. He was a very happy-go-lucky guy with a great sense of humor at that time, and always supplied the [female] color separators with candy and other little gifts".&lt;ref name="CBA9"&gt;Cooke, Jon B., &amp; Christopher Irving.

For Charlton in 1974 he did [[Liberty Belle (comics)#Charlton Comics|Liberty Belle]] backup stories in ''[[E-Man]]'' and conceived [[Killjoy (comics)|Killjoy]]. Ditko produced much work for Charlton's science-fiction and horror titles, as well as for former Marvel publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]]'s start-up line [[Atlas/Seaboard Comics]], where he co-created the superhero the [[Destructor (comics)|Destructor]] with writer Archie Goodwin, and penciled all four issues of the namesake series (Feb.–Aug. 1975), the first two of which were inked by Wally Wood. Ditko worked on the second and third issues of ''[[Tiger-Man]]'' and the third issue of ''Morlock 2001'', with [[Bernie Wrightson]] inking.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

===Latter-day Ditko===
Ditko returned to DC Comics in 1975, creating a short-lived title, ''[[Shade, the Changing Man]]'' (1977–1978).&lt;ref name=gcd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 174 "Steve Ditko returned to mainstream comics with ''Shade, the Changing Man''. Joined by writer Michael Fleisher, Ditko unveiled the story of Rac Shade, a secret agent-turned-fugitive from the extra-dimensional world of Meta."&lt;/ref&gt; Shade was later revived, without Ditko's involvement, in DC's mature-audience imprint [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]]. With writer [[Paul Levitz]], he co-created the four issue [[sword and sorcery]] series ''[[Stalker (comics)|Stalker]]'' (1975–1976).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/2226/ ''Stalker''] at the Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 164 "This sword and sorcery title by scripter Paul Levitz and artist Steve Ditko epitomized the credo 'Be careful what you wish for'. The series anti-hero was a nameless wanderer whose dreams of becoming a warrior brought him first slavery, then worse."&lt;/ref&gt; Ditko and writer [[Gerry Conway]] produced the first issue of a two–issue ''[[Man-Bat]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 168 "Thanks to his appearances in ''Detective Comics'' and ''Batman'', Man-Bat's popularity soared to the point where writer Gerry Conway and artist Steve Ditko launched the [character] into his own series."&lt;/ref&gt; He also revived the Creeper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Manning|first= Matthew K. |editor-last=Dougall |editor-first=Alastair |chapter=1970s |title= Batman: A Visual History |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2014 |location=London |page=119 |isbn=978-1465424563}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did such various other jobs as a short [[Etrigan the Demon|Demon]] backup series in 1979 and stories in DC's horror and science-fiction anthologies. Editor [[Jack C.

Since then, Ditko's solo work has been published intermittently by Robin Snyder, who was his editor at Charlton, Archie Comics, and [[Renegade Press]] in the 1980s.

In 2008, Ditko and Snyder released ''The Avenging Mind'', a 32-page essay publication featuring several pages of new artwork; and ''Ditko, Etc...'', a 32-page comic book composed of brief vignettes and editorial cartoons. Releases have continued in that format, with stories introducing such characters as the Hero, Miss Eerie, the Cape, the Madman, the Grey Negotiator, the !? and the Outline.&lt;ref name="McCulloch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/steve-ditko-self-published-comics-mr-a-summary-spider-man-objectivism/ |title=Steve DItko Doesn't Stop: A Guide To 18 Secret Comics By Spider-Man's Co-Creator |first=Joe |last=McCulloch |date=July 10, 2013 |publisher=[[Townsquare Media|ComicsAlliance]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413145619/http://comicsalliance.com/steve-ditko-self-published-comics-mr-a-summary-spider-man-objectivism/ |archivedate=April 13, 2015 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said in 2012 of his self-published efforts, "I do those because that's all they'll let me do."&lt;ref name=newyorkpost2012 /&gt;

==BBC documentary==
In September 2007, presenter [[Jonathan Ross]] hosted a one-hour documentary for [[BBC Four]] titled ''[[In Search of Steve Ditko]]''. The program covers Ditko's work at Marvel, DC, and Charlton Comics and at Wally Wood's ''witzend'', as well as his following of Objectivism. It includes testimonials by [[Alan Moore]], [[Mark Millar]], Jerry Robinson and Stan Lee, among others. Ross, accompanied by writer [[Neil Gaiman]], met Ditko briefly at his New York office, but he declined to be filmed, interviewed or photographed. He did, however, give the two a selection of some comic books. At the end of the show, Ross said he has since spoken to Ditko on the telephone and, as a joke, that he was now on first name terms with him.&lt;ref name=ross /&gt;
