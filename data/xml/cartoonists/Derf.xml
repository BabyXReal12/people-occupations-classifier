'''John Backderf''' (born October 1959 in  [[Richfield, Ohio]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[cartoonist]], also known as '''Derf''' or '''Derf Backderf'''. He is most famous for his recent graphic novels, especially ''[[My Friend Dahmer]]'', the international bestseller which won an Angoulême Prize, and earlier for his comic strip ''The City,'' which appeared in a number of alternative newspapers from 1990–2014.  In 2006 Derf won the [[Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award]] for cartooning.&lt;ref name="Archived"&gt;Gardner, Alan. "[http://dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2006/05/01/john-backderf-wins-robert-f-kennedy-journalism-award/ John Backderf wins Robert F. Kennedy Journalism award]", May 1, 2006, ''The Daily Cartoonist''.

== Early life ==
Backderf grew up in [[Richfield, Ohio]], the son of a chemist. He attended Eastview Junior High and [[Revere High School (Ohio)|Revere High School]], where one of his classmates was future [[serial killer]] [[Jeffrey Dahmer]].

Backderf graduated high school in 1978, and began attending the [[Art Institute of Pittsburgh]]. The following summer he worked as a garbageman back in his hometown. Backderf later transferred to, and graduated from, [[Ohio State University]]. Backderf was immersed in the [[punk subculture|punk]] movement during the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;

He began as a political cartoonist, for the ''Ohio State Lantern'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jeffpearlman.com/the-quaz-qa-john-backderf/|title=John Backderf {{!}} Jeff Pearlman|website=www.jeffpearlman.com|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; then professionally at ''The Evening Times'' in West Palm Beach, FL. He worked as a staff cartoonist at the ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'' in the late 80s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cacgrants.org/cultural-partners/derf-backderf-creative-workforce-fellow|title=Derf Backderf - Creative Workforce Fellow {{!}} CAC|website=Cuyahoga Arts &amp; Culture|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s Backderf worked in the newsroom of the ''[[Akron Beacon Journal]]''.

== Work ==

===''The City''===
Backderf's comic strip ''The City'' appeared in over 140 publications, mostly free weekly newspapers, starting with the now-defunct ''Cleveland Edition'' in 1990, including: ''[[The Village Voice]]'', ''[[The Chicago Reader]]'', ''[[Cleveland Scene]]'', ''[[Miami New Times]]'', ''[[Houston Press]]'', ''[[Pittsburgh City Paper]]'', ''[[The Providence Phoenix]]'', and ''[[Washington City Paper]]''.  In 2014, Derf announced that he was discontinuing ''The City'' to focus on graphic novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Backderf |first=Derf |url=http://derfcity.blogspot.com/2014/05/the-end-of-city.html |title=The end of THE CITY |publisher=Derfcity.blogspot.com |date=2014-05-15 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strips from ''The City'' were collected in ''The City: The World’s Most Grueling Comic Strip'' (SLG Publishing, 2003) and a multi-volume series of comic books, ''True Stories'' (Alternative Comics, 2015, 2016).

===Graphic novels===

==== ''Punk Rock &amp; Trailer Parks'' ====
Backderf wrote ''Punk Rock &amp; Trailer Parks'' (SLG Publishing, 2010), a 152-page graphic novel set in 1980, during the punk rock heyday in [[Akron, Ohio]], a music scene that produced such acts as [[Devo]], [[Chrissie Hynde]], and [[The Cramps]]. ''Punk Rock &amp; Trailer Parks'' is a fictional story that follows one remarkable young man named Otto who, through talent, wits and sheer chutzpah becomes a star in the [[Rubber City]] punk scene and has memorable meetings with underground luminaries of the day, including [[Wendy O. Williams]], [[Stiv Bators]], [[Lester Bangs]], and [[The Clash]]. ''Punk Rock &amp; Trailer Parks'' was featured in the 2010 edition of ''[[Best American Comics]]'' (Houghton Mifflin).

==== ''My Friend Dahmer'' ====
''[[My Friend Dahmer]]'' (Abrams Comic Arts, 2012) is the culmination of a comic book project first started in 1994, shortly after [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] was murdered in prison. Derf's first Dahmer story appeared in ''[[Zero Zero (comics)|Zero Zero]]'' #18 (Fantagraphics, July 1997). Derf then pitched the project as a 100-page graphic novel, but failed to find a publisher. He then self-published a scaled-back 24-page ''My Friend Dahmer'' comic book in 2002. The original self-published comic book was nominated for an [[Eisner Award]] and was adapted and staged as a one-act play by the NYU Theater Dept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derfcity.com/crap/jd2.html |title=Young Jeffrey Dahmer |accessdate=2011-08-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024042431/http://www.derfcity.com/crap/jd2.html |archivedate=October 24, 2008 |df= }}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The final 224-page incarnation was nominated for [[Ignatz Award|Ignatz]], [[Harvey Award|Harvey]], and [[Rueben Award]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spxpo.com/ignatz-awards |title=Ignatz Awards 2012 |publisher=The Small Press Expo |date=2010-11-28 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; received an [[Angoulême|Angoulême Award]] and was named by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the top five non-fiction books of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/12/04/top-10-arts-lists/slide/derf-backderf-my-friend-dahmer/ | work=Time | title=The Top 10 Everything Of 2012 | date=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lev Grossman, book critic of [[Time Magazine|''Time'' magazine]], named ''My Friend Dahmer'' as one of the "top five non-fiction books of the year."&lt;ref&gt;http://entertainment.time.com/2012/03/28/my-friend-dahmer-the-unspeakable-horror-of-life-in-the-1970s/&lt;/ref&gt; A [[My Friend Dahmer (film)|film adaptation]] of ''My Friend Dahmer'', starring [[Ross Lynch]], [[Anne Heche]], [[Dallas Roberts]] and [[Vincent Kartheiser]], premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival and received a general theatrical release in the fall of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://ew.com/movies/2017/05/15/ross-lynch-my-friend-dahmer-release-date/&lt;/ref&gt; The film received generally positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=My Friend Dahmer|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/my_friend_dahmer/|language=en|accessdate=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Trashed'' ====
''Trashed'' (Abrams Comic Arts, 2015), an Eisner Award-winning&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newsarama.com/30298-2016-eisner-award-winners-full-list.html&lt;/ref&gt; fictional story based on Derf's experiences as a 19-year-old garbageman, was published as a 240-page graphic novel. The project first appeared as a 50-page magazine-size comic book ([[SLG Publishing]], 2002) . It was Derf's first attempt at long-form storytelling and was nominated for the Eisner Award for Best Writer-artist. Derf revisited the project as a webcomic in 2010 and 2012 on his website.

==Art style ==
Backderf's art has been compared to [[Robert Crumb]], with his use of black to "project character and menace" praised.&lt;ref name=HP&gt;Harrison, John. "My Friend Dahmer", ''Headpress 25: William Burroughs &amp; the Flicker Machine'', Headpress, 2003 p.76-9. {{ISBN|1-900486-26-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derf cites Crumb as an influence, along with ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' and [[Spain Rodriguez]]. He cites [[Expressionism]] as the inspiration for his usage of heavy ink, but feels the major influence on his work is the imagery of [[punk subculture|punk]].&lt;ref name=HP /&gt;

Backderf has contributed to many well-known national publications, including ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[The Progressive]]''. His illustrations have also appeared on posters, T-shirts, and CD covers.

=== Exhibitions ===
Backderf's work has been displayed in many galleries and museums both in the United States and abroad. In 1995, he had a large solo show at Altered Image Gallery in Cleveland, and in 1999 the [[Akron Art Museum]] put on a retrospective of his work, titled "Apocalyptic Giggles: The Industrial Cartoon Humor of Derf." The [[Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum]] at the Ohio State University established a Derf Collection of original art and papers in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Caitlin McGurk |url=http://library.osu.edu/blogs/cartoons/tag/derf/ |title=Derf |publisher=Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum Blog |date=2012-05-01 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Backderf has won over 50 awards for his newspaper work, including a prestigious Bronze Medal from the Society of Newspaper Design. He was a member of the newsroom team for the ''[[Akron Beacon Journal]]'' that was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1995. In 2006 Derf won the [[Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award]] for cartooning.&lt;ref name="Archived"/&gt; He received the Prix Révélation at the 2014 [[Angoulême International Comics Festival]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Prix révélation |url=http://www.parismatch.com/Culture/Livres/Festival-BD-Angouleme-Notre-chronique-de-Mon-ami-Dahmer-546618 |title=Festival BD Angoulême.
