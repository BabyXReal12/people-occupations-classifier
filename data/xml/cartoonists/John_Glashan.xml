'''John Glashan''' (born '''John McGlashan''', 24 December 1927 – 15 June 1999&lt;ref name="plimmer"&gt;Martin Plimmer, "[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-john-glashan-1107883.html Obituary: John Glashan]", ''The Independent'', 22 July 1999. Accessed 20 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Scottish [[cartoonist]], illustrator and playwright. He was the creator of the "[[Genius (comics)|Genius]]" cartoons.

Glashan's cartoons typically included small pen-and-ink figures drawn over a fabulous backdrop often featuring fantastic [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or imaginary architecture, surreal landscapes or gloriously impractical ingenious-looking machines.

==Life and work==

Born in [[Glasgow]] and the son of the portrait painter Archibald A. McGlashan, John McGlashan studied painting at the [[Glasgow School of Art]] after [[Conscription_in_the_United_Kingdom#After_1945|national service]] in the army. He moved to London intending to make a living from painting portraits, but was unable to do so. After switching to cartooning and illustrating he shortened his surname to "Glashan".&lt;ref name="plimmer" /&gt;

Glashan's cartoons appeared in ''[[Lilliput (magazine)|Lilliput]]'', ''[[Queen (magazine)|Queen]]'', ''[[The Spectator]]'', ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'',&lt;ref name="plimmer" /&gt; ''[[Private Eye]]'', and various London newspapers, as well as ''[[Holiday (magazine)|Holiday]]'' and the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]''.

Glashan's illustrations were also used in advertising material for brands such as [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]], Aalders and Marchant, and [[Blue Nun]].&lt;ref name="cartoon_archive"&gt;* "[https://www.cartoons.ac.uk/cartoonist-biographies/g-h/JohnGlashan.html John Glashan]", British Cartoon Archive. Accessed 20 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of humorous guidebooks created with [[Jonathan Routh]] in the late 1960s allowed extensive expression of Glashan's graffiti-like style, combining small figures (often bearded men) with scrawled text – but, even here, often with elaborate backdrops.

The "[[Genius (comics)|Genius]]" cartoons, which allowed Glashan to use colour and a great expanse of space, ran in the ''Observer Magazine'' from 1978 to 1983, whereupon he concentrated on landscape painting. His cartoons reappeared from 1988 in the ''Spectator''.

==Publications==
[[File:Books by John Glashan.jpg|thumb|Books by, or with illustrations by, John Glashan (flanked by irrelevant Pelicans)]]

===Books===

* ''The Eye of the Needle.'' London: Dennis Dobson, 1961. A hardback of about eighty (unnumbered) pages. Some stories spread over as many as seven pages; many others are just single frames. Glashan's style already seems fully formed: little bearded men (by themselves, in small groups, or even in their thousands) are rendered even smaller by lovingly drawn but oppressive neo-renaissance or rococo backdrops. In the inner rear flap, we are told that Glashan was previously a brain surgeon. Much, perhaps all of the content of the book had previously appeared in ''Lilliput'' (a fact that goes unmentioned).
* ''Speak Up You Tiny Fool.'' New York: Dial, 1966. A hardback of about ninety (unnumbered) pages, in a larger format than ''The Eye of the Needle'' and duplicating much of the content of the earlier book, with additions. [[Jules Feiffer]] provides an introduction.
* ''The Penguin John Glashan.'' Harmondsworth, Middx: Penguin, 1967. A paperback of about a hundred (unnumbered) pages, duplicating much of ''Speak Up You Tiny Fool''.
* ''Private Eye Cartoon Library 7: The Jokes of John Glashan.'' London: Private Eye &amp; André Deutsch, 1975. {{ISBN|0-233-96723-0}} (On the front cover: "Private Eye Cartoon Library 7 / John Glashan / The Meths Festival and Other Celebrations".) Contains about one hundred (unnumbered) pages of cartoons, of which most were drawn from the book rather than reproduced from ''Private Eye'' (or so the copyright page informs us). Perhaps three quarters of the book is devoted to "The Meths Festival and other celebrations", a story about what transpires during one annual festival held in "the sleepy pig iron town of Grinding Mallet", a grim place whose every brick is lovingly delineated. While the Head Methner of the Meth Chateau shows around an appreciative group of Japanese businessmen, festival-goer Filbert learns to walk with his head tilted to one side.
* ''The Mental Health Work-Out Book: An Account of the Darren Whitlow Technique.'' London: Crystal Clear, 1986. {{ISBN|0-948453-42-7}}. "Researched" (written and illustrated) by Glashan. On the back cover: "This volume shows how you too can build a Powerful Brain and enjoy the Benefits of Radiant Mental Health."&lt;!-- Capitalization, with its parody of adverts for quack nostrums, in the original. Please do not "correct". --&gt;
* ''John Glashan's World.'' London: Robinson, 1991. {{ISBN|1-85487-104-8}}. An anthology of Glashan's work.
