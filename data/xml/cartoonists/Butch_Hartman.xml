'''Elmer Earl "Butch" Hartman IV''' (born January 10, 1965) is an American animator, director, producer, voice actor, writer, composer,  and [[YouTuber]] best known for creating the [[Nickelodeon]] cartoons ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'', ''[[Danny Phantom]]'', ''[[T.U.F.F. Puppy]]'' and ''[[Bunsen Is a Beast]]''. Hartman also owns a production company, Billionfold Inc., which he uses primarily to produce his shows. Hartman was an executive producer on ''The Fairly OddParents'' for the entirety of its 16-year run.

Hartman's latest animated program, ''[[Bunsen Is a Beast]]'', aired in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/bunsen-is-a-beast-nickelodeon-animated-series-1201990376/|title=How Animator Butch Hartman Created His New Nickelodeon Show ‘Bunsen Is a Beast’|last=Flores|first=Terry|date=2017-02-16|work=Variety|access-date=2017-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 8, 2018, Hartman announced in a [[YouTube]] video that he had left Nickelodeon on February 2 after having worked at the studio since December 1997.&lt;!--Listen at the 28-minute mark---&gt;&lt;ref name="leave1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartman|first1=Butch|title=Why I Left Nickelodeon|url=https://soundcloud.com/user-978368492/why-i-left-nickelodeon|via=SoundCloud|accessdate=February 10, 2018|date=February 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He confirmed in the video that this resulted in the end of production on ''Bunsen Is a Beast'' after just one season.&lt;ref name="leave2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hartman|first1=Butch|title=Why I Left Nickelodeon|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4faDISwSVo|via=YouTube|accessdate=February 9, 2018|date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hartman was born in [[Highland Park, Michigan]]. He received the nickname Butch as a young boy and continued to use the name professionally as an adult. Hartman spent his childhood in [[Roseville, Michigan]] and his teenage years in [[New Baltimore, Michigan]].&lt;ref name=newbaltimore&gt;{{cite news|last=Larese|first=Katelyn|title=With Video: Cartoon creator Butch Hartman leaves his mark|url=http://www.voicenews.com/life/with-video-cartoon-creator-butch-hartman-leaves-his-mark/article_f6d285a4-54fa-5f46-8b0e-092da146c824.html|date=July 10, 2014|newspaper=The Voice|accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Anchor Bay High School]] in New Baltimore in 1983.&lt;ref name=newbaltimore/&gt; He subsequently attended the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Fairly OddParents' is not just for kids|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2004/02/12/tel_404389.shtml|accessdate=November 11, 2012|newspaper=[[The Augusta Chronicle]]|date=February 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
While still attending CalArts, Hartman received the chance to intern as an in-between animator on the [[Don Bluth]] film ''[[An American Tail]]''. Shortly after graduating from CalArts, Hartman was hired as a character designer and storyboard artist for an unidentified ''[[My Little Pony]]'' animated series. It was the first time he had worked with storyboards, and because of this, he was soon fired from the job.&lt;ref name=Sheen&gt;{{cite news|last=Fletcher|first=Alex|title=TUFF Puppy' Butch Hartman interview: 'I want Charlie Sheen character|url=http://www.digitalspy.ca/ustv/interviews/a342596/tuff-puppy-butch-hartman-interview-i-want-charlie-sheen-character.html|accessdate=November 11, 2012|newspaper=Digital Spy|date=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Hartman found work with [[Ruby-Spears]], where he worked on ''[[It's Punky Brewster]]'' and ''[[Dink, the Little Dinosaur]]''. He was also a member of the video reference crew for the [[Disney]] film ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]''.

In the early 1990s he was hired as an artist in the model department at [[Hanna-Barbera]], and was eventually contacted by studio president [[Fred Seibert]] to make the shorts ''Pfish and Chip'' and ''Gramps'' for the ''[[What a Cartoon! Show]]''. Eventually, he became a writer, director and storyboard artist for several of the early [[Cartoon Network]] shows, including ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'' and ''[[I Am Weasel]]''. After his contract with Hanna-Barbera expired, he went to work with Seibert on the ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' show for [[Nickelodeon]].

During his time working at Hanna-Barbera, he became friends with future ''[[Family Guy]]'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]. The two would later go on to make the short ''Zoomates'' together for Oh Yeah! Cartoons. The character Dr. Elmer Hartman in ''Family Guy'' was named after Hartman. He also voiced various characters in the show's first few seasons.

===Working at Nickelodeon===
His biggest success came in December 1997, when he created ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]''. The series originally started out as a series of shorts on the anthology show, ''Oh Yeah! Cartoons''. Eventually, Nickelodeon decided to pick the shorts up as a full series. Premiering in 2001, the adapted series ended up becoming a huge hit, second only in the ratings to ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' (and it briefly even passed ''SpongeBob''{{'}}s ratings). Following the third ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'' crossover ''The Jimmy-Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators'', the series ceased production in 2006, but it was announced on Hartman's forum on February 2, 2007 that 20 more episodes would be produced; the 6th season of ''Fairly OddParents'' aired on February 18, 2008, starting with the 1-hour special ''[[Fairly OddBaby]]''. From May 1, 2009 to May 3, 2009, the 3-part special ''[[Wishology]]'' aired; although that too was originally intended as a series finale, the series was renewed for another season. A tenth season was eventually ordered in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mt.com/news/2243487/fairly-oddparents-new-character |title= 'The Fairly OddParents' Is Getting A New Character -- And A Tenth Season [Exclusive] |publisher= |accessdate= November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Fairly OddParents'' is Nickelodeon's second longest-running animated show behind ''SpongeBob''.

Due to the success of ''The Fairly OddParents'', Hartman was asked to create another show for Nickelodeon; Hartman says the President of Nickelodeon asked him if he had an idea, and before he could say the title he was given the greenlight. The show would later become ''[[Danny Phantom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ball |first=Ryan |title= Butch Hartman Talks Danny Phantom |url= http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/butch-hartman-talks-danny-phantom/?replytocom=1267|accessdate=November 11, 2012|newspaper=[[Animation Magazine]]|date=April 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; To produce the show, in 2004, Hartman founded [[Billionfold Inc.]], which he also used, and still uses today, to produce his other projects. ''Danny Phantom'' received critical acclaim and is considered Hartman's best show, with Hartman himself acknowledging it as perhaps the best of his programs. ''Danny Phantom'' ended production in early 2007.

Around 2008–2009, Hartman began production his third show for Nickelodeon, ''[[T.U.F.F. Puppy]]'', which premiered in 2010 alongside the ''Jimmy Neutron'' spin-off ''[[Planet Sheen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lloyd|first=Robert|title=Television reviews: 'T.U.F.F. Puppy' and 'Planet Sheen'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/02/entertainment/la-et-tuff-puppy-20101002|accessdate=November 11, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series received mixed to positive reviews and ran for 3 seasons before being cancelled.

His fourth show, ''[[Bunsen Is a Beast]]'', aired on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons from January 16, 2017 to February 10, 2018. On February 8, 2018, Hartman announced on his Twitter and YouTube accounts that he had left Nickelodeon as of February 2 after a 20-year run.&lt;ref name="leave1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="leave2" /&gt;

===Future projects===
After Hartman announced that he was leaving Nickelodeon, he said in the same video that he was working new projects to be released in the future. He announced that he is working on a show called ''Elf Detective'' for his YouTube channel as well a secret project with Pocketwatch, Inc.

On June 18, 2018, Hartman launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign for his own streaming service for family entertainment called OAXIS. It reached its goal of $250,000 on July 18, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qhwNAMgX6ms&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
His other TV work includes voicing various characters on the animated series ''[[Family Guy]]'' and playing the character Sean Masters on the short-lived series ''[[Generations (U.S. TV series)|Generations]]'' in 1991. He also appeared on the [[NBC]] soap opera ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' during the late 1980s. In 2012, it was announced that Hartman was set to serve as the director on the film adaptation of ''[[ALF (TV series)#Film|ALF]]'' for [[Sony Pictures Animation]].

In 2015, Hartman launched a "kid safe network ([[Mobile app|app]]) of live shows and cartoons" called the Noog Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.strangekidsclub.com/2015/08/11/animator-butch-hartman-launches-the-noog-network/|title=Animator Butch Hartman Launches the Noog Network {{!}} Strange Kids Club|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/top-stories/butch-hartman-launches-noog-app/|title=Butch Hartman Launches Noog App|website=Animation Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, Hartman showed on [[YouTube]] the short sequences of his Cartoon Network's pilot episode dating back to 2011, called ''Dynamice!''.&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJzTSD-I-RQ |title=Unreleased Cartoon Network Pilot: Dynamice! - YouTube |publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He's also working on a comic book called ''"The 3 O'Clock Club",'' as revealed on a [[YouTube]] live stream on his channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/puRnCtf3aJM|title=My First Comic Book!|publisher=|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/05/22/3-oclock-club-to-keep-the-monsters-at-bay-in-august/|title=3 O'Clock Club To Keep The Monsters At Bay In August|last=Johnston|first=Rich|date=2016-05-22|website=Bleeding Cool News And Rumors|access-date=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comic was released in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/05/22/3-oclock-club-to-keep-the-monsters-at-bay-in-august/|title=3 O'Clock Club To Keep The Monsters At Bay In August - Bleeding Cool News And Rumors|date=2016-05-22|work=Bleeding Cool News And Rumors|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Hartman started a podcast called ''Speech Bubble'', on which he talks about cartoons, movies, pop culture, and various other topics. Several voice actors have appeared on the podcast, including [[Rob Paulsen]], [[Tara Strong]], [[Jerry Trainor]], [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] and [[Vic Mignogna]]. After initially posting excerpts on his primary YouTube channel, the podcast videos were later moved to its own dedicated YouTube channel, now including full episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/speech-bubble/id1292425421?mt=2|title=Speech Bubble by Butch Hartman on Apple Podcasts|website=Apple Podcasts|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/|title=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hartman currently lives in [[Bell Canyon, California]], with his wife, Julieann, and daughters, Carly and Sophia Hartman. Hartman is also an openly devout [[Christianity|Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frost|first1=AJ|title=Noog Network creates safe online place for kids|url=http://www.jewishaz.com/arts_features/noog-network-creates-safe-online-place-for-kids/article_9b98876a-66d7-11e5-a980-9765d8d8530e.html|accessdate=February 9, 2018|work=Jewish News of Greater Phoenix|date=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartman's younger brothers are: Mike, Keith and Timothy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzr3A7Sz474|title=Fun Facts About My Shows: Fairly Odd Parents, Danny Phantom, &amp; TUFF Puppy!|first=Butch|last=Hartman|date=September 1, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=November 8, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character [[Timmy Turner]] from ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'', was named after his younger brother, Timothy, and the character of Mikey from ''Bunsen is a Beast'' was, as he explained, his chance to name a lead after his brother Mike.

In 2005, Hartman, along with his wife, founded Hartman House, a non-profit organization that travels to developing nations and some of the most poverty stricken areas in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=White|first=Stefanie|title=Nickelodeon cartoon creator Butch Hartman visits McKinney|url=http://www.scntx.com/articles/2006/11/24/mckinney_courier-gazette/news/tnews4.txt|accessdate=November 11, 2012|newspaper=McKinney Courier-Gazette Star|date=November 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartman House has built two homes for families in [[Guatemala]], fed nearly 7,200 families with [[Thanksgiving]] meals in the U.S., and is in the midst of funding a school in [[Uganda]]. At Hartman House events, Hartman usually draws and autographs items related to his work for children.
