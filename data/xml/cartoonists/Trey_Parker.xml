'''Randolph Severn''' "'''Trey'''" '''Parker III''' (born October 19, 1969) is an American actor, animator, writer, director, producer, singer, and songwriter. He is known for co-creating ''[[South Park]]'' (1997–present) along with his creative partner [[Matt Stone]],  as well as co-writing and co-directing the [[Tony Award]]-winning musical ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'' (2011). Parker was interested in film and music as a child, and attended the [[University of Colorado, Boulder]] following high school, where he met Stone. The two collaborated on various short films, and starred in a feature-length musical, titled ''[[Cannibal! The Musical]]'' (1993).

Parker and Stone moved to Los Angeles and wrote their second film, ''[[Orgazmo]]'' (1997). Before the premiere of the film, ''[[South Park]]'' premiered on [[Comedy Central]] in August 1997. The duo, who possess full creative control of the show, have since produced music and video games based on the show, which continues to run. They worked on a feature film titled ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]'' (1999), which received acclaim from both critics and fans. Alongside Stone, he has also produced various feature films and television series, including ''[[Team America: World Police]]'' (2004). After several years of development, ''The Book of Mormon'', a musical co-written by Parker, Stone, and composer [[Robert Lopez]], premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and became immensely successful. In 2013, he and Stone established their own production studio, Important Studios.

Parker has been the recipient of various awards over the course of his career, including five [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for his work on ''South Park'', as well as four [[Tony Awards]] and a [[Grammy Award]] for ''The Book of Mormon''.

==Early life==
Parker was born in [[Conifer, Colorado]], the son of insurance saleswoman Sharon and [[geologist]] Randolph "Randy" Parker.&lt;ref name=Bio.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/trey-parker-20989887#awesm=~oCvYSa7R3xZqwl |title=Trey Parker biography |publisher=Biography.com |accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; He was a shy child who received "decent" grades and was involved in honors classes.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt; He idolized [[Monty Python]], which he began watching on television in the third grade; his later ventures into animation would bear considerable influence from [[Terry Gilliam]].&lt;ref name=Playboy&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Steve |last=Pond |date=June 2000 |title=Interview: Trey Parker and Matt Stone |magazine=[[Playboy]] |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=65–80}} {{cite web|url=http://treyparker.info/archives_playboy_00jun00.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727232806/http://treyparker.info/archives_playboy_00jun00.htm |archivedate=July 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sixth grade, Parker wrote a sketch titled ''The Dentist'' and appeared in his school's talent show. He played the dentist and had a friend play the patient. The plot involved what can go wrong at the dentist; due to the amounts of fake blood involved, Parker's parents were called and were upset, with Parker later recalling that "the kindergartners were all crying and freaking out".&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/10/30/8391792/index.htm|title=''South Park'' creators haven't lost their edge|author=Devin Leonard|date=October 27, 2006|publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker has described himself as "the typical big-dream kid" who envisioned a career in film and music.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt; He made [[short film]]s on the weekends with a group of friends, beginning when he was 14. His father had purchased him a video camera and the group continued making films until graduation.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; He became interested in pursuing music at 17, but only comedy-centered songs; he wrote and recorded a full-length comedy album, ''Immature: A Collection of Love Ballads For The '80's Man'', with friend David Goodman during this time.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt; As a teenager, Parker developed a love for [[musical theatre]], and joined the Evergreen Players, a venerable mountain community theater outside of Denver. At 14, he performed his first role as chorus member in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' and ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' and went on to also design sets for the community theater's production of ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]''. In high school, he also played piano for the chorus and was president of the choir counsel.&lt;ref name="frankrich"&gt;{{Cite news|last=|first=|title=Frank Rich’s Liner Notes for ''The Book of Mormon''|newspaper=''[[Playbill]]''|date=May 20, 2011|url=http://www.playbill.com/playblog/2011/05/frank-richs-liner-notes-for-the-book-of-mormon/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625214159/http://www.playbill.com/playblog/2011/05/frank-richs-liner-notes-for-the-book-of-mormon/|archivedate=June 25, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="denverpost"&gt;{{Cite news |last= Moore|first= John|title=''The Book of Mormon'': Colorado's kings of pop-culture subversion|newspaper=''[[The Denver Post]]'' |date= June 12, 2011 |url=http://www.denverpost.com/commented/ci_18257045?source=commented-entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Evergreen was nationally known for its choir program, Parker was a very popular high school student, connected to his position as the head of the choir. He was typically the lead in school plays and was also prom king.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt; While in school, Parker had a part-time job at a [[Pizza Hut]] and was described as a film geek and music buff.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/apr/01/art.artanddesign|title=Undisputed kings of cartoon satire|author=Paul Harris|date=April 1, 2007|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his graduation from high school in 1988, Parker spent a semester at [[Berklee College of Music]] before transferring to the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; During his time there, he took a film class in which students were required to collaborate on projects.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt; In the course, he met [[Matt Stone]] — a math major from the nearby town of [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]] — and the two immediately bonded over provocative, anti-authoritarian humor and Monty Python.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; Parker's first film was titled ''Giant Beavers of Southern Sri Lanka'' (1989), parodying [[Godzilla]]-style rampages with beavers; fellow student [[Jason McHugh]] later remarked that the idea nearly got him laughed out of class.&lt;ref name="guardian2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/apr/02/sout-park-matt-stone|title=Smalltown heroes|author= Johnny Davis|date=April 3, 2009|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shpadoinkle&gt;[[Jason McHugh|McHugh, Jason]] (2011).

It became an unexpected sensation, resulting in Parker's first award — a Student Academy Award. Parker recalled sitting in the auditorium in front of students from animation schools such as [[CalArts]], who had produced works of a higher artistic caliber and were "fuming" that he won.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt;

==Career==
===Career beginnings===
====''Cannibal! The Musical'' (1992–94)====
In 1992, Parker, Stone, McHugh, and Ian Hardin founded a production company named the Avenging Conscience, named after the [[D.W. Griffith]] [[The Avenging Conscience|film by the same name]], which was actively disliked by the group.&lt;ref name=WW&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Michael|title=The South Park Anniversary: The First Trey Parker-Matt Stone Interview|url=http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2007/08/the_south_park_anniversary_the.php|publisher=Westword|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker again employed the cutout paper technique on Avenging Conscience's first production, ''Jesus vs. Frosty'' (1992), an animated short pitting the religious figure against [[Frosty the Snowman]].

The quartet created a three-minute [[Trailer (film)|trailer]] for a fictional film titled ''Alferd Packer: The Musical''. The idea was based on an obsession Parker had with [[Alfred Packer]], a real nineteenth-century [[prospecting|prospector]] accused of [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; During this time, Parker had become engaged to long-time girlfriend Lianne Adamo, but their relationship fell apart shortly before production on the trailer had begun.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; "Horribly depressed", Parker funneled his frustrations with her into the project, naming Packer's "beloved but disloyal" horse after her.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;&lt;ref name="cannibalSS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/03/cannibal-matt-stone-and-trey-parkers-original-twisted-musical/|title=''Cannibal!'': Matt Stone and Trey Parker's Original Twisted Musical|author= Joshua Kurp |date=March 29, 2011|work=Splitsider|publisher=[[The Awl]]|accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer became somewhat of a sensation among students at the school, leading Virgil Grillo, the chairman and founder of the university's film department, to convince the quartet to expand it to a feature-length film.&lt;ref name=cannibalSS/&gt; Parker wrote the film's script, creating an ''[[Oklahoma!]]''-style musical featuring ten original [[show tunes]].&lt;ref name="nonesuch"/&gt; The group raised $125,000 from family and friends and began shooting the film. The film was shot on [[Loveland Pass]] as winter was ending, and the crew endured the freezing weather.&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;&lt;ref name="nonesuch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Glasgow|title=The Royal Nonesuch: Or, What Will I Do When I Grow Up?|year=2007|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=9781555847203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtY_7UdCLQ0C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22Avenging+Conscience%22+Parker+Stone&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Vf8wU6XkDuPO0gHgwICoCg&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Avenging%20Conscience%22%20Parker%20Stone&amp;f=false|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker — under the pseudonym Juan Schwartz — was the film's star, director and co-producer.&lt;ref name=cannibalSS/&gt;

''Alferd Packer: The Musical'' premiered in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] in October 1993; "they rented a limousine that circled to ferry every member of the cast and crew from the back side of the block to the red carpet at the theater's entrance."&lt;ref name=nonesuch/&gt; The group submitted the film to the [[Sundance Film Festival]], who did not respond. Parker told McHugh he had a "vision" they needed to be at the festival, which resulted in the group renting out a conference room in a nearby hotel and putting on their own screenings.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; [[MTV]] did a short news segment on ''The Big Picture'' regarding the film,&lt;ref name=WW/&gt; and they made industry connections through the festival.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/arts/theater/features/south-park-2011-3/|title=Latter-Day Saints|author= Carl Swanson |date=March 7, 2011|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=New York Media, LLC|accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They intended to sell video rights to the film for $1 million and spend the remaining $900,000 to create another film.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt; The film was instead sold to [[Troma Entertainment]] in 1996 where it was retitled ''Cannibal! The Musical'',&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; and upon the duo's later success, it became their biggest-selling title.&lt;ref name=cannibalSS/&gt; It has since been labeled a "[[cult classic]]" and adapted into a stage play by community theater groups and even high schools nationwide.&lt;ref name="cannibal1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/publicspectacle/2012/02/09/cannibal-the-musical-in-a-high-school-get-the-splash-zone-ready|title=Cannibal!

Following the film's success, the group, sans Hardin, moved to [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="nonesuch"/&gt; Upon arrival, they met a lawyer for the [[William Morris Agency]] who connected them with producer [[Scott Rudin]]. As a result, the duo acquired a lawyer, an agent, and a script deal.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt; Despite initially believing themselves to be on the verge of success, the duo struggled for several years. Stone slept on dirty laundry for upwards of a year because he could not afford to purchase a mattress.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt; They unsuccessfully pitched a children's program titled ''[[Time Warped]]'' to [[Fox Kids]], which would have involved fictionalized stories of people in history.&lt;ref name="hr"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-south-parks-trey-parker-171189 | title= Why ''South Park''{{'}}s Trey Parker and Matt Stone Now Say It's 'Wrong' to Offend | date= March 24, 2011|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | accessdate=May 19, 2011 | first=Stephen | last=Galloway}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trio created two separate pilots, spaced a year apart, and despite the approval of development executive [[Pam Brady]], the network disbanded the Fox Kids division.&lt;ref name="nonesuch"/&gt;

[[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]], who was a fan of ''Cannibal!'', contacted the duo to produce a 15-minute short film for [[Seagram]] to show at a party for their acquisition of [[Universal Studios]].&lt;ref name="yourstudio"/&gt; Due to a misunderstanding, Parker and Stone [[improvisation|improvised]] much of the film an hour before it was shot, creating it as a spoof of 1950s instructional videos.&lt;ref name="yourstudio"/&gt; The result, ''[[Your Studio and You]]'', features numerous celebrities, including [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Demi Moore]], and [[Steven Spielberg]]. "You could probably make a feature film out of the experience of making that movie because it was just two dudes from college suddenly directing Steven Spielberg," Parker later remarked, noting that the experience was difficult for the two.&lt;ref name="yourstudio"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://treyparker.info/archives_zap2it_16jul01.htm| title='South Park' Creator Trey Parker Cops to Kooky Universal Spoof| date=July 16, 2001| publisher=[[Zap2it]]| accessdate=July 2, 2014| first=Stephen| last=Galloway| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028085139/http://treyparker.info/archives_zap2it_16jul01.htm| archivedate=October 28, 2014| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time between shooting the pilots for ''Time Warped'', Parker penned the script for a film titled ''[[Orgazmo]]'', which later entered production. Half of the budget for the picture came from a Japanese porn company called Kuki, who wanted to feature its performers in mainstream Western media.&lt;ref name="nonesuch"/&gt; Independent distributor [[October Films]] purchased the rights to the film for one million dollars after its screening at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="nonesuch"/&gt; The film received an NC-17 rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which resulted in the poor box office performance of the film. Parker and Stone attempted to negotiate with the organization on what to delete from the final print, but the MPAA would not give specific notes.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt; The duo later theorized that the organization cared less because it was an independent distributor which would bring it significantly less money.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt;

While at Fox, executive Brian Graden cut Parker and Stone a personal check of a few thousand dollars to produce a video greeting card he could deliver to friends; the film would be a sequel to their earlier short ''Jesus vs. Frosty''.&lt;ref name="nonesuch"/&gt;  Graden sent the film on a [[VHS]] to several industry executives in Hollywood; meanwhile, someone digitized the clip and put it up on the Internet, where it became one of the very first [[viral video]]s.&lt;ref name="cnn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nonesuch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time2"&gt;{{cite news|author=Jeffrey Ressner and James Collins|title=Gross And Grosser|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 23, 1998|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988028-2,00.html|accessdate=April 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As ''Jesus vs. Santa'' became more popular, Parker and Stone began talks of developing the short into a television series. Fox refused to pick up the series, not wanting to air a show that included the character [[List of South Park residents#Mr. Hankey|Mr. Hankey]], a talking piece of feces.&lt;ref name="leno"&gt;{{cite video|people=Trey Parker, Matt Stone|date=1998|title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|medium=Television show|publisher=NBC}} Interview with Jay Leno&lt;/ref&gt; The two were initially skeptical of possible television deals, noting that previous endeavors had not turned out successful.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt; The two then entered negotiations with both [[MTV]] and Comedy Central.

''South Park'' premiered in August 1997 and immediately became one of the most popular shows on cable television, averaging consistently between 3.5 and 5.5 million viewers.&lt;ref name= Gournelos&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCI23BOylt4C|pages=11–19|title=Popular Culture and the Future of Politics: Cultural Studies and the Tao of ''South Park''| first= Ted|last=Gournelos|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7391-3721-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show transformed the then-fledgling Comedy Central into  "a cable industry power almost overnight."&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; At the time, the cable network had a low distribution of just 21 million subscribers.&lt;ref name= Gournelos/&gt; Comedy Central marketed the show aggressively before its launch, billing it as "why they created the [[V-chip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKQEuKMFs7U|title=First South Park Commercial before series premiere, 1997|first=|last=WhyTheHorseface|date=August 30, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;" The resulting buzz led to the network earning an estimated $30 million in T-shirts sales alone before the first episode was even aired.&lt;ref name= Gournelos/&gt; Due to the success of the series' first six episodes, Comedy Central requested an additional seven; the series completed its [[South Park (season 1)|first season]] in February 1998.&lt;ref name="NYDN1029"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Mink |first=Eric |title=''South Park'' comes up with a hallo-winner |date=October 29, 1998 |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location=[[New York, New York]] |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Tonight on TV |date=October 29, 1997 |work=[[Newsday]] |location=[[New York, New York]] |page=B35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Parker, Trey|date=2003|title=''South Park: The Complete First Season'': "Death"|format=Audio commentary |medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; An affiliate of the [[MTV Network]] until then, Comedy Central decided, in part due to the success of ''South Park'', to have its own independent sales department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comedy Central will fly solo in '98|work=Multichannel News |author=Forkan, Jim|date=September 29, 1997|page=|url=http://business.highbeam.com/4377/article-1G1-19948327/comedy-central-fly-solo-98}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1998, Comedy Central had sold more than $150 million worth of merchandise for the show, including T-shirts and dolls.&lt;ref name="McCabeJanet"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=McCabe |first1=Janet |last2=Akass|first2=Kim|title=Quality TV: Contemporary American Television and Beyond |year=2007 |publisher=I.

Parker and Stone became celebrities as a result of the program's success; Parker noted that the success of ''South Park'' allowed him to pursue, for a time, a lifestyle that involved partying with women and "out-of-control binges" in [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt; Their philosophy of taking every deal (which had surfaced as a result of their lack of trust in the early success of ''South Park'') led to their appearances in films, albums, and outside script deals. Among these included ''[[BASEketball]]'', a 1998 comedy film that became a critical and commercial flop, and rights to produce a prequel to ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'', which was never completed.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt;

====''Bigger, Longer, &amp; Uncut'' and continued success (1999–present)====

Parker and Stone signed a deal with [[Comedy Central]] in April 1998 that contracted the duo to producing ''South Park'' episodes until 1999, gave them a slice of the lucrative spinoff merchandising the show generated within its first year, as well as an unspecified seven-figure cash bonus to bring the show to the big screen, in theaters.&lt;ref name="charlotte"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CO&amp;s_site=charlotte&amp;p_multi=CO&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB6D55F54B73880&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Sweet!

As such, they figured the phenomenon would be over soon, and they decided to write a personal, fully committed musical.&lt;ref name="blureview3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://collider.com/south-park-bigger-longer-uncut-blu-ray-review/9696/|title=''South Park: Bigger, Longer, &amp; Uncut'' [Blu-ray] – Review|author=Andre Dellamorte |date=October 22, 2009|publisher=Collider.com|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker and Stone fought with the MPAA to keep the film R-rated; for months the ratings board insisted on the more prohibitive [[NC-17]].&lt;ref name="rating"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00E11FB3A5E0C7A8EDDAF0894D1494D81|title=Loosening a Strict Film Rating for ''South Park''|author=Bernard Weinraub|date=June 29, 1999|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was only certified an R rating two weeks prior to its release, following contentious conversations between Parker/Stone, Rudin, and [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref name="rating2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,272257,00.html|title=Putting the 'R' in ''South Park''|author=David Hochman|date=July 9, 1999|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|accessdate=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker felt very overwhelmed and overworked during the production process of the film, especially between April and the film's opening in late June. He admitted that press coverage, which proclaimed the end of ''South Park'' was near, bothered him.&lt;ref name="Playboy"/&gt; ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]'' opened in cinemas in June 1999 and received critical acclaim while grossing $83 million at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Park - Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=southpark.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker and Stone continue to write, direct, and voice most characters on ''South Park''. Over time, the show has adopted a unique production process, in which an entire episode is written, animated and broadcast in one week.&lt;ref name="abc3"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jake Trapper and Dan Morris|title=Secrets of 'South Park'|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=September 22, 2006|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Entertainment/Story?id=2479197&amp;page=3|accessdate=April 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker and Stone state that subjecting themselves to a one-week deadline creates more spontaneity amongst themselves in the creative process, which they feel results in a funnier show.&lt;ref name="cnn" /&gt; Although initial reviews for the show were negative in reference to its crass humor, the series has received numerous accolades, including five [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, a [[Peabody Award]], and numerous inclusions in various publications' lists of greatest television shows. Though its viewership is lower than it was at the height of its popularity in its earliest seasons, ''South Park'' remains one of the highest-rated series on Comedy Central.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Television and film projects===

====''That's My Bush!'' (2000–01)====
In 2000, Parker and Stone began plotting a television sitcom starring the winner of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential election]]. The duo were "95 percent sure" that [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Al Gore]] would win, and tentatively titled the show ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond|Everybody Loves Al]]''.&lt;ref name="Parker2" /&gt; The main goal was to parody sitcom tropes, such as a lovable main character, the sassy maid, and the wacky neighbor.&lt;ref name="Stone2"&gt;{{Cite video | people=[[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]]| date=October 2006 |title=That's My Bush! The Definitive Collection: "A Poorly Executed Plan" |format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker said the producers did not want to make fun of politics, but instead lampoon sitcoms.&lt;ref name="Parker2"&gt;{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=October 2006 |title=That's My Bush!

With the [[United States presidential election, 2000#Results|confusion of who the President would be]], the show's production was pushed back.&lt;ref name="Parker2" /&gt; The show was filmed at [[Sony Pictures Studios]], and was the first time Parker and Stone shot a show on a production lot.&lt;ref name="Parker3"&gt;{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=October 2006 |title=That's My Bush!

Although ''[[That's My Bush!]]'', which ran between April–May 2001, received a fair amount of publicity and critical notice, according to Stone and Parker, the cost per episode was too high, "about $1 million an episode."&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=20010803&amp;id=yCUfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=C9AEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4871,422240| title=Comedy Central Cancels "That's my Bush"|author=Lynn Elber|publisher= AP Newswire|work=Spartanburg Herald-Journal| date=August 3, 2001|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedy Central officially cancelled the series in August 2001 as a cost-cutting move; Stone was quoted as saying "A super-expensive show on a small cable network...the economics of it were just not going to work."&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZwFHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v_MMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5498,471464&amp;hl=en|date=August 3, 2001| title=''That's My Bush'' cancelled|publisher= AP Newswire|work=Sun Journal|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedy Central continued the show in reruns, considering it a creative and critical success.&lt;ref name="herald" /&gt; Parker believed the show would not have survived after the [[September 11 attacks]] anyway, and Stone agreed, saying the show would not "play well".&lt;ref name="Parker5"&gt;{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=October 2006 |title=That's My Bush!

====''The Book of Mormon'' (2011–present)====
Parker and Stone, alongside writer-composer [[Robert Lopez]], began working on a musical centering on [[Mormonism]] during the production of ''Team America''. Lopez, a fan of ''South Park'' and creator of the puppet musical ''[[Avenue Q]]'', met with the duo after a performance of the musical, where they conceived the idea.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopezint"&gt;{{Citation|last=Jones |first=Kenneth |title=''Playbill''{{'s}} brief encounter with Robert Lopez |newspaper=''[[Playbill]]'' |date=April 4, 2011 |url=http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/149477-PLAYBILLCOMS-BRIEF-ENCOUNTER-With-Robert-Lopez |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511010339/http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/149477-PLAYBILLCOMS-BRIEF-ENCOUNTER-With-Robert-Lopez |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical, titled ''The Book of Mormon: The Musical of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'', was worked on over a period of several years; working around their ''South Park'' schedule, they flew between [[New York City]] and Los Angeles often, first writing songs for the musical in 2006.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; Developmental workshops began in 2008,&lt;ref name="id"&gt;{{Citation |last= Adams |first= Guy |title= Mormons to get 'South Park' treatment |newspaper= [[The Independent]] |date= November 19, 2008 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/mormons-to-get-south-park-treatment-1024598.html |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the crew embarked on the first of a half-dozen workshops that would take place during the next four years.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; Originally, producer Scott Rudin planned to stage ''The Book of Mormon'' [[off-Broadway]] at the [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in summer 2010, but opted to premiere it directly on Broadway, "[s]ince the guys [Parker and Stone] work best when the stakes are highest."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/theater/theaterspecial/the-path-of-the-book-of-mormon-to-broadway.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=theater# | work=The New York Times | first=Patrick | last=Healy | title=The Path of ‘The Book of Mormon' to Broadway | date=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Important Studios and future projects (2013–present)====
[[File:Trey Parker and Matt Stone by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Parker (left) and Stone (right) at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2016]]

With sufficient funds from their work on ''South Park'' and ''The Book of Mormon'', the duo announced plans to create their own production studio, Important Studios, in January 2013. The studio will approve projects ranging from films to television to theatre.&lt;ref name="important"&gt;{{Citation  |title='South Park' Creators to Start Company, Important Studios

On April 13, 2016, [[Universal Pictures]] announced that Trey Parker would be voicing the villain Balthazar Bratt in ''[[Despicable Me 3]].''

In a September 2006 edition of the [[ABC News]] program ''[[Nightline]]'', Parker expressed his views on religion, stating that he [[Belief in God|believes in "a God"]] and that "there is knowledge that humanity does not yet possess" while cautioning that it would take a long time to explain exactly what he meant by his belief in God. Parker believes all religions are "silly". He states that "All the religions are superfunny to me… The story of Jesus makes no sense to me. God sent his only son. Why could God only have one son and why would he have to die? It's just bad writing, really. And it's really terrible in about the second act." Parker further remarked, &lt;blockquote&gt;Basically… out of all the ridiculous religion stories which are greatly, wonderfully ridiculous—the silliest one I've ever heard is, 'Yeah… there's this big giant universe and it's [[Metric expansion of space|expanding]], it's all gonna [[Big Crunch|collapse]] on itself and we're all just here just 'cause… just &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''cause'''. That, to me, is the most ridiculous explanation ever.&lt;ref&gt;Jake Tapper and Dan Morris (September 22, 2006).

Politically, Parker describes himself as [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], as does his partner Matt Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Winter|first=Bill|title=Trey Parker&amp;nbsp;– Libertarian

&lt;blockquote&gt;What we're sick of—and it's getting even worse—is: you either like [[Michael Moore]] or you wanna fuckin' go overseas and shoot Iraqis. There can't be a middle ground. Basically, if you think Michael Moore's full of shit, then you are a super-[[Christianity|Christian]] [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] whatever. And we're both just pretty middle-ground guys. We find just as many things to rip on on the [[Left-wing politics|left]] as we do on the right. People on the [[Far-left politics|far left]] and the [[Far-right politics|far right]] are [[Horseshoe theory|the same exact person to us]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/trey-parker-and-matt-stone-talk-team-america-world-police|title=Trey Parker and Matt Stone talk Team America: World Police|date=October 4, 2004|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
