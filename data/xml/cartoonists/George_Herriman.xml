'''George Joseph Herriman''' (August&amp;nbsp;22, 1880&amp;nbsp;– April&amp;nbsp;25, 1944) was an American cartoonist best known for the comic strip ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' (1913–1944).  More influential than popular, ''Krazy Kat'' had an appreciative audience among those in the arts. [[Gilbert Seldes]]' article "The Krazy Kat Who Walks by Himself" was the earliest example of a critic from the high arts giving serious attention to a comic strip. ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' placed the strip first on its list of the greatest comics of the 20th century. Herriman's work has been a primary influence on cartoonists such as [[Will Eisner]], [[Charles M. Schulz]], [[Robert Crumb]], [[Art Spiegelman]], [[Bill Watterson]], and [[Chris Ware]].

Herriman was born in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, to [[mulatto]] [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] parents, and grew up in [[Los Angeles]].  After he graduated from high school in 1897, he worked in the newspaper industry as an illustrator and engraver.  He moved on to cartooning and comic strips—a medium then in its infancy—and drew a variety of strips until he introduced his most famous character, Krazy Kat, in his strip ''[[The Dingbat Family]]'' in 1910.  A ''Krazy Kat'' daily strip began in 1913, and from 1916 the strip also appeared on Sundays.  It was noted for its poetic, dialect-heavy dialogue; its fantastic, shifting backgrounds; and its bold, experimental page layouts.  In the strip's main motif, Ignatz Mouse pelted Krazy with bricks, which the naïve, [[Androgyny|androgynous]] Kat interpreted as symbols of love.  As the strip progressed, a love triangle developed between Krazy, Ignatz, and Offisa Pupp.

Herriman lived most of his life in Los Angeles, but made frequent trips to the Navajo deserts in the southwestern U.S.  He was drawn to the landscapes of [[Monument Valley]] and the [[Enchanted Mesa]], and made [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino County]] the location of his ''Krazy Kat'' strips.  His artwork made much use of [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and Mexican themes and motifs against shifting desert backgrounds.  He was a prolific cartoonist who produced a large number of strips and illustrated [[Don Marquis]]'s books of poetry about ''[[Archy and Mehitabel]]'', an alley cat and a cockroach.  Newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] was a proponent of Herriman and gave him a lifetime contract with [[King Features Syndicate]], which guaranteed Herriman a comfortable living and an outlet for his work despite its lack of popularity.

===1880–1900: Early life===

George Joseph Herriman was born at 348 Villere Street{{efn|[[McDonogh 35 High School]] later occupied the site.{{sfn|McCash|2010}} }} in [[New Orleans]] on August 22, 1880.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=30}}  He came from a line of French-speaking Louisiana [[Creoles of color|Creole mulattoes]]{{sfnm|1a1=McCash|1y=2010|2a1=McDonnell|2a2=O'Connell|2a3=Havenon|2y=1986|2p=30}} who were considered [[free people of color]],{{sfn|Boxer|2007}} and were reportedly active in the early [[Slavery in the United States|abolitionist movement]].{{sfn|McCash|2010}}  His {{not a typo|paternal grandfather, George Herriman Sr.}}, owned a tailor shop on [[Royal Street, New Orleans|Royal Street]] in New Orleans.{{efn|The shop was occupied by Bryant Galleries as of 2010.{{sfn|McCash|2010}} }}  His maternal grandmother was born in [[Havana]], Cuba.{{sfn|Stern|2008}}  His parents were {{not a typo|George Herriman, Jr.}} (1850–1923),&lt;ref&gt;Tisserand, Michael (2016).

Krazy: George Herriman, A Life in Black and White. p. 233. Harper. {{ISBN|978-0061732997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; born in [[Iberville Parish, Louisiana|Iberville]].{{sfn|Inge|1996|p=3}}  The family attended the St. Augustine Catholic Church in New Orleans' [[Tremé]] neighborhood.{{sfn|McCash|2010}}

When he was ten, Herriman and his family moved to [[Los Angeles]],{{sfn|McCash|2010}} where he grew up south of downtown near [[Main Street (Los Angeles)|Main Street]] and [[Washington Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Washington Boulevard]].  His father worked there as a tailor.  Herriman attended the Catholic boys' school St. Vincent's College (now [[Loyola High School (Los Angeles)|Loyola High School]]).{{sfn|Mostrom|2010}} Soon after graduating in 1897, he sold a sketch of the Hotel Petrolia in [[Santa Paula, California|Santa Paula]] to the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Herald]]''.  This landed him a $2-per-week job there as an assistant in the engraving department, where he occasionally did drawings for advertisements and [[Editorial cartoonist|political cartoons]].{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=31}}

===1900–1905: Early career in New York===

&lt;!-- [[File:George and Mabel Herriman - Wedding - 1902-07-07.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A black and white photograph of a woman wearing a dress and a man wearing a suit.|George and Mabel Herriman on their wedding day (July 7, 1902)]] --&gt;&lt;!-- copyright staus in question --&gt;

[[File:Herriman090706.jpg|thumb|alt=A black-and-white cartoon drawing.  A short, fat man labeled "Parker" and a tall, thin man labeled "Herrin" are in a farmyard, whose barn is labeled "Republican Stables".  The two are looking at a horse with a human face and an enormous collar.  The horse is labeled "Gillett".  The caption reads, "Parker: 'Will he stand without hitching?'; Herrin: 'Sure! See that collar?'"|Herriman's earliest published work was humor and editorial cartoons. (September 7, 1906)]]

When he was 20, Herriman sneaked aboard a freight train bound for [[New York City]], hoping his chances as an artist would be better there.  He was unsuccessful at first, and survived by working as a [[barker (occupation)|barker]] and billboard painter at [[Coney Island]], until one of the leading [[humor magazine]]s of the day, ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]'', accepted some of his cartoons.  Between June 15 and October 26, 1901, eleven of his cartoons appeared in that magazine's pages, in the heavily [[Hatching|crosshatched]] style of the day.  He often used sequential images in his cartoons, as in the emerging comic strip medium.  On September 29 that year, his first real comic strips were published, one in the [[Pulitzer, Inc.|Pulitzer]] chain of newspapers on a non-contractual, one-shot basis and another on a continuing basis in the Philadelphia North American Syndicate's first comic strip supplement.  His first color comic strips appeared in the [[McClure Newspaper Syndicate|T. C. McClure Syndicate]] beginning October 20.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=33}}

His success with these syndicated strips convinced Herriman to give up on magazine submissions.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|pp=33–34}}  For the Pulitzer papers on February 16, 1902, he began his first strip that had a continuing character, ''Musical Mose''. The strip featured an [[African American|African-American]] musician who impersonated other ethnicities, only to suffer the consequences when discovered by his audience.  ''Professor Otto and his Auto'', about a terrifyingly dangerous driver, followed in March, and  ''Acrobatic Archie'', a "kid strip" with a child protagonist, first appeared in April.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=34}} With his future as a cartoonist seemingly assured, Herriman traveled back to Los Angeles to marry his childhood sweetheart and returned with her to New York.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=36}}

In the November 1902 issue of the literary magazine ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' Herriman wrote of his profession self-deprecatingly, while poet La Touche Hancock, in an article in that issue titled "The American Comic and Caricature Art",{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=36}} wrote, "Art and poetry is the characteristic of George Herriman.  Were his drawings not so well known one would think he had mistaken his vocation."{{sfnm|1a1=Hancock|1y=1902|1p=263|2a1=McDonnell|2a2=O'Connell|2a3=Havenon|2y=1986|2p=36}} Herriman's work was increasing in popularity, and he occasionally had front-page, full-color strips for the Pulitzer supplements, such as ''Two Jolly Jackies'' about two unemployed sailors, which began in January 1903.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|pp=36–37}}  He began drawing the cowboy strip ''Lariat Pete'' in September for the McClure syndicate after ''Two Jolly Jackies'' was ended.{{sfn|Blackbeard|1983|p=51}}

[[File:Major Ozone's Fresh Air Crusade 1906-04-21 panels 11 and 12.png|thumb|left|alt=In two comic strip panels, two men obsessively in search of fresh air are led to an insane asylum, where they are locked away.|The comic strip ''Major Ozone's Fresh Air Crusade'' (1904–1906) was an early success for Herriman. (April&amp;nbsp;21,&amp;nbsp;1906)]]

In June, Herriman was employed by the ''[[New York World]]''.  There, he illustrated [[Roy McCardell]]'s commentaries on local events, beginning June 28 and running to the year's end.  Herriman still produced syndicate work, such as ''Major Ozone's Fresh Air Crusade'' for the World Color Printing Company beginning January 2, 1904.  Another of Herriman's obsessive characters, the Major traveled the world in an unsuccessful search for the purest air and spouted poetic dialogue.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=37}}  ''Major Ozone'' was so popular that it soon was given the supplement's front page.{{sfn|Blackbeard|1983|p=51}}  The same month, Herriman moved from the ''World'' to the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', where he was given a larger quantity and variety of work, including cartoon reporting on sports and politics.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=37}}  In February and March, he had a short-lived continuing character comic strip about domestic life called ''Home Sweet Home''. That spring, he began illustrating a series of articles written by Walter Murphy called ''Bubblespikers''.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=41}}

Rudolph Block hired Herriman for the [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst]] papers with "a salary commensurate with his talents", starting April 22 at the ''[[New York Journal-American|New York American]]'',{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=41}} which ran no daily comic strips at the time.{{sfn|Blackbeard|1983|p=51}}  Herriman drew sports cartoons in an office alongside [[Frederick Burr Opper]], [[Jimmy Swinnerton|James Swinnerton]],{{sfnm|1a1=Blackbeard|1y=1983|1p=51|2a1=McDonnell|2a2=O'Connell|2a3=Havenon|2y=1986|2p=41}} and [[Tad Dorgan]], who was popularly known as "Tad" and was considered a star at another Hearst paper, the ''[[New York Journal-American|New York Evening Journal]]''.  Tad and Herriman were often assigned to cover the same sporting events and became close friends. In 1924, Tad called Herriman "one of the best sporting artists in the world" and regretted that Herriman no longer did that kind of work.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|pp=41, 44–45}}  Herriman continued with Hearst until June 1905, when he left the paper,{{sfnm|1a1=McDonnell|1a2=O'Connell|1a3=Havenon|1y=1986|1pp=44–45|2a1=Blackbeard|2y=1983|2p=52}} possibly because of the new sports editor's unsympathetic attitude to cartoonists.{{sfn|Blackbeard|1983|p=52}}  He returned to Los Angeles{{sfnm|1a1=McDonnell|1a2=O'Connell|1a3=Havenon|1y=1986|1pp=44–45|2a1=Mostrom|2y=2010|3a1=Blackbeard|3y=1983|3p=53}} in the latter half of 1905.{{sfn|Blackbeard|1983|p=53}}

In California, Herriman continued to mail in work to the World Color Printing Company.  He revived ''Major Ozone'' and produced ''Grandma's Girl—Likewise Bud Smith'', which he combined from two earlier strips, and a two-tiered children's strip, ''Rosy Posy—Mama's Girl''.  He began to work with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on January 8, 1906, before returning to Hearst that summer.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=45}}  Accompanying a front-page illustration in Hearst's ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Examiner]]'', Herriman was announced as "the ''Examiner''{{'}}s cartoonist" on August 21.  His artwork began to appear on nearly every page, resulting in greatly increased sales for the newspaper.{{sfnm|1a1=McDonnell|1a2=O'Connell|1a3=Havenon|1y=1986|1p=45|2a1=Blackbeard|2y=1983|2p=54}}  In October, he stopped working for World Color.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=45}}

Following the success of [[Bud Fisher]]'s daily strip ''[[Mutt and Jeff|A. Mutt]]'',{{sfn|Harvey|1994|p=242}}{{efn|Herriman may also have been inspired by the earlier daily strip ''[[A. Piker Clerk]]'' (1903–04) by [[Clare Briggs]], which also had a sports theme, and which Herriman had likely seen.{{sfnm|1a1=Blackbeard|1y=1983|1pp=52, 54|2a1=Harvey|2y=1994|2p=242}} }} which debuted in late 1907, Herriman began a similarly sports-themed daily strip that December called ''Mr. Proones the Plumber''.  The strip was not as successful as Fisher's, and it ceased to appear after December 26.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=45}}  His next comic strip, ''Baron Mooch'', starring the titular freeloader, debuted in the ''Examiner'' on October 12, 1909.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=49}}&lt;ref&gt;Note: Historian [[Don Markstein]] gives November 1, 1909, at the entry [http://toonopedia.com/mooch.htm Baron Mooch] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6b6aAtodL?url=http://toonopedia.com/mooch.htm Archived] from the original on August 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Herriman began two more strips in November 1909 with the World Color Printing Company—''Alexander the Cat'' and ''Daniel and Pansy'', which both appeared in color.  ''Daniel and Pansy'' was Herriman's first strip to feature an all-animal cast.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=50}}  This was followed in the ''Examiner'' on December 20 by the short-lived ''Mary's Home from College'', a precursor to the "girl strips" such as [[Cliff Sterrett]]'s ''[[Polly and Her Pals]]'' and John Held Jr.'s ''Merely Margie'', and on December 23 by ''Gooseberry Sprig'', about an aristocratic, cigar-smoking duck who had previously and popularly appeared in Herriman's sports cartoons.&lt;ref name="gooseberry-toonopedia"&gt;[http://toonopedia.com/gooseber.htm ''Gooseberry Sprigg''] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

|alt = In a five-panel cartoon strip, a cat and a mouse are sleeping. The cat awakens and kisses the mouse, and the mouse dreams of cupids.}}

In 1910, the sports editor of the ''New York Evening Journal'' called Herriman back to New York to cover for Tad Dorgan who was in San Francisco covering the [[Jack Johnson (boxer)#The "Fight of the Century"|"Fight of the Century"]] between [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] and [[James J. Jeffries|Jim Jeffries]].{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=50}}  Six days after arriving in New York, Herriman began ''[[The Dingbat Family]]'', starring E. Pluribus Dingbat and his family.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=51}}  Herriman used typed lettering on the strip on July 26, 1910, but quickly went back to hand-lettering.{{sfnm|1a1=Nel|1y=2012|1p=284|2a1=McDonnell|2a2=O'Connell|2a3=Havenon|2y=1986|2p=55}} On August 10, 1910, Herriman retitled the strip ''The Family Upstairs''.&lt;ref name=toonopedia&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6XFvJF7LA?url=http://toonopedia.com/dingbat.htm ''The Dingbat Family'' a.k.a. ''The Family Upstairs''] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. Archived from [http://toonopedia.com/dingbat.htm the original] on April 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The original title return after the strip of November 15, 1911, when the Dingbats' building was demolished to make room for a department store and they and their upstairs nemeses parted paths.&lt;ref name=toonopedia /&gt;

Critics do not regard the strip highly, but it provided the vehicle for a fruitful situation: in the July 26 episode, a mouse threw a brick at the family cat—called "Kat"—which hit the cat on the head.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=51}}  The antics of this mouse and "Kat" continued to appear in the bottom portion of ''[[The Dingbat Family]]''.  Herriman said he did this "to fill up the waste space".{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=51}}  About a month after its first appearance, the "Kat" crept up on the sleeping mouse and kissed it loudly.  The mouse awoke saying, "I dreamed an angel kissed me", while the "Kat" crept away and said, "Sweet thing".{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|pp=52, 54}}

[[File:New York Evening Journal cartoonists photo 1911-01-31.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A black and white photograph of six young-to-middle-aged men, all wearing white shirts, dark ties and waistcoats.|The cartoon staff at the ''[[New York Evening Journal]]'' (January&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;1911)&lt;br /&gt;Top, from left: [[Gus Mager]], Charles Wellington, Herriman&lt;br /&gt;Bottom, from left: [[Harry Hershfield]], Ike Anderson, [[Tad Dorgan]] ]]

The gender of "Kat" was unclear from the start.  Herriman experimented with a decision about the character's gender, but it remained ambiguous and he would refer to "Kat" as "he" or "she" as he saw fit. Herriman incorporated unusual details into the mini-strip's backgrounds—cacti, pagodas, fanciful vegetation, or anything else that struck his fancy; this became a signature of the later ''Krazy Kat'' strip.  The cast grew and soon included the mainstay character Bull Pupp and characters from the ''Gooseberry Sprigg'' strip.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=54}}  The strip's characters, relations and situations grew organically during its lifetime, encouraged by Herriman's colleagues.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|pp=54, 56}}

The cat-and-mouse substrip was gaining in popularity; instead of filling up space in the bottom of ''[[The Dingbat Family]]''{{'}}s panels, it began to occupy a tier of panels of its own.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=57}} In July 1912, while Herriman had the Dingbats on vacation, Krazy Kat and Ignatz Mouse took over the strip, which was retitled ''Krazy Kat and I. Mouse'' for the duration.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=59}}  On October 28, 1913, ''Krazy Kat'' debuted as an independent strip on the daily comics page.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=57}}

During the first few years of publication, ''Krazy Kat''{{'}}s humor changed from slapstick to a more [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]] kind.  The shifting backgrounds became increasingly bizarre, presaging things to come.  The strip expanded to a full-page black-and-white [[Sunday strip]] on April 23, 1916.{{efn|April 23, 1916, was actually a Saturday.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=58}} }}  Herriman made full use of his imagination and used the whole page in the strip's layout.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=58}}  The strips were unlike anything else on the comics page; spontaneous, formally daring, yet impeccably composed.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=61}}

Herriman visited [[Monument Valley]] in [[Arizona]] and similar places in [[New Mexico]] and southern [[Utah]], and incorporated the distinct forms of the desert landscape into his strips. The [[Enchanted Mesa]] of New Mexico first appeared in ''Krazy Kat'' in the summer of 1916.  Herriman may have visited after reading an article by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1913, but he may have gone earlier—the desert [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino County]], Arizona, that became the backdrop to ''Krazy Kat'' was first mentioned in a 1911 ''[[The Dingbat Family]]'' strip,{{sfn|Harvey|2010}} though the real Coconino County was located further southwest than Herriman's fanciful version.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=69}}

''The Dingbat Family'' finished in 1916 and was replaced by ''Baron Bean''{{'}}s debut the next day.  The strip's title character, The Baron, was an impoverished English nobleman, a tramp inspired by [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]].  He and his valet Grimes would plot ways to get by.  Herriman later introduced the main characters' wives, and after a run as a domestic strip, with occasional appearances of characters from Krazy Kat's world, it ended in January 1919.  It was replaced the next day by ''Now Listen Mabel'', which was about a young man courting a young woman; he would be caught in a compromising situation, which he would try to explain away with "Now listen Mabel..."  The strip lasted until that December.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|pp=57–58}}

{{Quote box|"It happens that in America irony and fantasy are practised in the major arts by only one or two men, producing high-class trash; and Mr Herriman, working in a despised medium, without an atom of pretentiousness, is day after day producing something essentially fine.  It is the result of a naive sensibility rather like that of the douanier Rousseau &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Henri Rousseau]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;; it does not lack intelligence, because it is a thought-out, a constructed piece of work."|[[Gilbert Seldes]] in ''The Seven Lively Arts'' (1924){{sfn|Seldes|1924|p=231}}|width=40em|align=right}}

''Krazy Kat'' gained an appreciative audience in the world of the arts.  The character debuted in film in 1916.  The first animated films starring a cat were produced by Hearst's [[International Film Service]], though without Herriman's direct involvement.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=65}}  In 1922, [[Adolph Bolm]] choreographed a jazz-pantomime ''Krazy Kat'' ballet written by [[John Alden Carpenter]]. It was first performed in New York in 1922 by [[Theatre Intime|Ballet Intime]], and Herriman illustrated the libretto and designed the costumes and scenario.

Hearst, an admirer of ''Krazy Kat'', had given Herriman a lifetime contract with his company [[King Features Syndicate]],{{sfnm|1a1=Wolk|1y=2008|1p=353|2a1=McDonnell|2a2=O'Connell|2a3=Havenon|2y=1986|2p=68|3a1=Gabilliet|3a2=Beaty|3a3=Nguyen|3y=2010|p=}} which gave Herriman the security to live anywhere he wanted.  In 1922, he moved back to Hollywood,{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=68}} into a two-story Spanish-style home at 1617 North Sierra Bonita,{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=76}} from where he made frequent visits to the Arizona desert.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=68}}  Herriman developed ties with members of the film industry; he knew [[Hal Roach]] Studio members [[Tom McNamara (director)|Tom McNamara]] and [[H. M. Walker|"Beanie" Walker]] from their newspaper days.  Walker, Herriman's best friend, was the head writer on the ''[[Our Gang]]'' shorts.  In the early 1920s, Herriman occasionally drew his strips at the Roach Studio.  He met celebrities, including [[Will Rogers]] and [[Frank Capra]], and presented them with hand-colored drawings.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=76}}  He loved Charlie Chaplin's films, and reviewed ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' in the magazine ''Motion Picture Classics'' in October 1925.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=77}}

[[File:Stumble Inn 1922-12-23 panel 4.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A comic strip panel.

The African-American, carrying a broom over his shoulder and descending the staircase, replies, "No, Boss, Ah ain't laid eyes on him fo the lass half hour".|''Stumble Inn'' ran from 1922 until 1925 (December 23, 1922).]]

Autumn 1922 saw the first daily installment of ''Stumble Inn'', the first non-''Krazy Kat'' strip Herriman had drawn since 1919.  A verbose strip whose Sundays were often overrun with prose, its lead characters were Uriah and Ida Stumble, who rented rooms to an assortment of strange characters.  The daily strip was short-lived, but the Sundays edition lasted three years.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|pp=67–68}}

From August 1925 until September 1929, King Features required that Herriman design the ''Krazy Kat'' Sundays so that they could be run either as a full Sunday page or as two four-panel dailies.  Herriman lamented intrusion on his page designs, and the artwork of the period took on a rushed look.  He was made to focus on the strip's characterization, and during this period, the Krazy—Ignatz—Offisa Pupp love triangle for which the strip is remembered became fully developed.  Pupp pined for Krazy, Krazy loved Ignatz, and Ignatz hated Krazy and pelted the annoying "Kat" with a brick, and Pupp imprisoned Ignatz.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|pp=77–78}}

Throughout the late 1920s, Herriman made frequent trips to [[Kayenta, Arizona]], in [[Navajo people|Navajo]] country about {{convert|25|mi|km}} from Monument Valley.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=69}}  He also made winter trips to Mexico.  The desert, Navajo artwork, and Mexican pottery and architecture became more prominent in Herriman's strips, and he sometimes used Spanish vocabulary in the dialogue.  Herriman did little work on these excursions, and it is likely that he drew his strips in hurried bursts when in Hollywood.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|pp=78–79}}

''Stumble Inn'' finished in late 1925, and it was replaced with the domestic strip ''Us Husbands'' (with ''Mistakes Will Happen'' as a "[[Topper (comic strip)|topper]]" strip), which ran until the end of that year.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=80}}  In 1928, Herriman took over the strip ''Embarrassing Moments'', which had begun in 1922 and had been drawn by several cartoonists.  The strip eventually became ''Bernie Burns'', in which embarrassing moments would happen to the title character.  The strip appeared in few papers, and after it ended in 1932, Herriman worked only on ''Krazy Kat'', although he provided illustrations for Don Marquis' popular ''Archy and Mehitabel'', a series of books of poetry about a cat and a cockroach.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=80}}

In 1930, Herriman sold his first Hollywood home to a friend and moved his family to 2217 Maravilla Drive, a Spanish-style mansion atop a hill.  It was adorned with paintings of Southwest and Native themes, and had a Mexican-style garden paved with [[flagstone]]s and decorated with painted pots and tropical plants.  Herriman later bought the lot across the street and turned it into a public park.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|pp=80–81}}

The 1930s were a period of tragedy for Herriman.  On September 29, 1931, his wife Mabel died after an automobile accident,{{sfnm|1a1=Los Angeles Times staff|1y=1931|2a1=Chicago Daily Tribune staff|2y=1931}} and in 1939, his youngest daughter Bobbie died unexpectedly at 30.  After his wife's death, Herriman never remarried and lived in Los Angeles with his cats and dogs.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=81}}  He developed a close relationship with cartoonist James Swinnerton's first wife Louise, with whom he frequently exchanged letters.  Herriman underwent a kidney operation in spring 1938, and during his ten-week convalescence King Features reran old ''Krazy Kat'' strips.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=86}}

[[File:1937 1107 kkat brick 500.jpg|right|thumb|alt=In a color comic strip panel, a brick thrown by a mouse through an open window hits a cat on the head. The cat says, "L'il ainjil" (little angel).|Starting in 1935, ''Krazy Kat'' ran in color. (November&amp;nbsp;7,&amp;nbsp;1937)]]

''Krazy Kat''{{'}}s popularity fell considerably over the years, and by the 1930s it was running in only thirty-five newspapers, while its contemporaries such as ''[[Bringing Up Father]]'' were reportedly running in up to a thousand.  Herriman realized his $750-per-week salary from Hearst's King Features Syndicate was far more than the revenue the strip could be generating, but Hearst refused Herriman's offer to take a pay cut.  Hearst let it be known that Herriman was to continue the strip as long as he liked.{{sfn|Sorel|1992|p=24}}  From 1935, ''Krazy Kat'' appeared in color, of which Herriman made bold use.  He reduced the amount of hatchwork and used larger, more open panels.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=81}}

Herriman died in his sleep in his home near Hollywood on April 25, 1944, after a long illness.{{sfnm|1a1=New York Times staff|1y=1944|2a1=Time staff|2y=1944}} An incompletely inked penciling of a week's worth of daily strips was found on his drawing board. On his death certificate, the cause of death was listed as "[[Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease|non-alcoholic]] [[cirrhosis]] of the liver",{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=219}} and despite his mixed-race heritage, he was listed as "caucasian".{{sfnm|1a1=Elam|1y=2011|1p=79|2a1=Heer|2y=2005}} The ''[[New York Journal-American]]'' ran a front-page obituary.{{sfn|Sorel|1992|p=25}} His funeral at Little Church of Flowers at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] was attended by few.  Cartoonist [[Harry Hershfield]] spoke at the funeral, saying, "If ever there was a saint on earth, it was George Herriman".{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=88}} According to his request, his body was cremated and his remains were scattered over Monument Valley.{{sfnm| 1a1=McDonnell |1a2=O'Connell |1a3=Havenon |1y=1986 |1p=88 |2a1=Harvey |2y=2010}}

On June 25, 1944, two months after Herriman's death, the last of his completed ''Krazy Kat'' strips, a full-page Sunday, was printed.{{sfn|Boxer|2012}}  At the time, Hearst usually engaged new cartoonists when the artists of popular strips quit or died, but he made an exception for Herriman, as he felt that no one could take his place.{{sfn|Lyons|1944}}

Herriman was described as self-deprecatingly modest, and he disliked being photographed.{{sfn|Mostrom|2010}}  The ''New York Journal-American''{{'}}s obituary described him as a devoted husband and father, of slight build, mild-mannered and an anonymous contributor to charities.{{sfnm|1a1=Sorel|1y=1992|1p=25|2a1=McDonnell|2a2=O'Connell|2a3=Havenon|2y=1986|2p=86}}  He was generous to his friends, and sold his first Hollywood house, which he had bought for $50,000, to a friend for $40,000.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=81}} Though a private person, he was said to be an entertaining host to his friends.  He would sometimes stay silent during social occasions and would often leave the room to wash dishes, which he said he enjoyed as it gave him the opportunity to think.  His favorite game was poker, which he particularly enjoyed playing with his fellow cartoonists.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=37}}

Herriman had a great love of animals, and had a large number of dogs and cats;{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=81}} he had five dogs and thirteen cats in 1934.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=50}}  He usually kept to a vegetarian diet, except when it made him feel too weak, and he refused to ride horses.  He so admired [[Henry Ford]]'s pacifist stance that he would only buy [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] automobiles. He purchased a new model annually.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=86}}

Herriman married his childhood sweetheart Mabel Lillian Bridge in Los Angeles on July 7, 1902.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=36}}  They had two daughters: Mabel, nicknamed "Toodles", later "Toots") and Barbara, nicknamed "Bobbie",{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=37}} who had [[epilepsy]].{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=81}}

Herriman was born to mixed-race parents,{{sfn|Heer|2005}} and his birth certificate lists Herriman as "colored".{{sfn|Boxer|2007}}  In the post- ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' U.S., in which "[[separate but equal]]" racial segregation was enshrined, people of mixed race had to choose to identify themselves as either black or white.  Herriman seems to have identified himself as white. According to comics academic Jeet Heer, his early work is "replete with black caricatures", such as ''Musical Mose'', in which the lead character, an African-American musician, wishes his "color would fade".{{sfn|Heer|2005}}  Racial ambivalence crept into ''Krazy Kat'', such as on two occasions where Krazy's black fur was dyed white.  Ignatz falls in love with the whitened Krazy, only to return to hatred and brick-throwing when the truth is revealed.  Similarly, in an oft-repeated joke, Ignatz would accidentally become covered with coal dust and would be spurned by the normally love-struck Krazy.  In one such episode, a brick thrown by the blackened Ignatz hits Krazy, who declares, "A lil Eetiopium Mice, black like a month from midnights.  Fuwi!"{{efn|"A little Ethiopian Mouse, black like a month of midnights.  Phooey!"}} Once Ignatz reverts to his white self, Krazy loves him again.{{sfn|Stern|2008}}

Herriman's ethnic heritage was unknown to his colleagues.  Fellow cartoonist Tad Dorgan nicknamed him "the Greek", a label which stuck and was taken up by his biographers and the press, who called him the son of a Greek baker.{{sfn|Heer|2005}}  At other times, he was identified as French, Irish, and Turkish.{{sfn|Heer|2011}}  He told a friend that he was Creole, and speculated that he may have "Negro blood" in him, as he had "[[Afro-textured hair|kinky hair]]".{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=30}}  The friend said that Herriman wore a hat to hide his hair,{{sfn|Heer|2005}} which may have been an attempt to [[Passing (racial identity)|pass as white]].{{sfn|Amiran|2000|p=56}}  Herriman said that he dreamed of being reborn a Navajo.{{sfn|Heer|2011}}  On his death certificate, he was listed as "Caucasian",{{sfnm|1a1=Elam|1y=2011|1p=79|2a1=Heer|2y=2005}} and his daughter Mabel had his father's birthplace listed as [[Paris]] and his mother's as [[Alsace-Lorraine]].{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=30}}

Sociologist [[Arthur Asa Berger]] made Herriman's mixed-race heritage known in 1971.  While researching for Herriman's entry for the ''[[Dictionary of American Biography]]'',  Berger discovered the cartoonist's race was listed as "colored" on his birth certificate obtained from the New Orleans Board of Health.  The 1880 census for New Orleans listed his parents as "mulatto".{{sfn|Inge|1996|pp=2–3}}  On reading this, African-American poet [[Ishmael Reed]] dedicated his 1972 novel ''[[Mumbo Jumbo (novel)|Mumbo Jumbo]]'' to "George Herriman, Afro-American, who created Krazy Kat".  Herriman came to be identified as Black or Creole in comics literature, including his first book-length biography, ''Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman'' (1986),{{sfn|Inge|1996|p=4}} while the "Greek" label stuck with some biographers, and was used by [[Bill Blackbeard]] in his introductions to the ''Krazy and Ignatz'' volumes in the early 2000s.{{sfn|Harvey|2003|p=60}} Later research at the [[New Orleans Public Library]] by cartoonist Brian Nelson showed that Herriman's maternal grandmother was born in Havana, Cuba, that all his relatives were listed as "mulatto" on the 1890 census, and that Herriman may also have had Spanish or Native American ancestry.{{sfn|Stern|2008}}

Writer [[E.&amp;nbsp;B.

His stature was such that decades after his death, his work was displayed in art galleries.{{sfnm|1a1=Kramer|1y=1982|2a1=Boxer|2y=2006}}

Critics found Herriman's work difficult to classify and contextualize; Seldes, {{not a typo|[[E.&amp;nbsp;E.

The strip has had a lasting influence on a large number of cartoonists. ''[[Mutts]]'' creator Patrick McDonnell calls ''Krazy Kat'' one of his foremost influences,{{sfn|McDonnell|2007|p=6}} and is co-author of ''Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman'' (1986).{{sfn|Heer|2010|p=10}}  [[Will Eisner]]{{sfn|Lundy|2011}} discovered Herriman's comics when he was selling newspapers in the 1930s and called ''Krazy Kat'' "the big strong influence" on his own work.{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=38}}  [[Art Spiegelman]] called Herriman one of his "conscious influences".{{sfn|Jacobowitz|2007|p=154}}  Herriman's widespread influence on American {{not a typo|[[underground comix]]}},{{sfn|Estren|1974|pp=28, 30–31}} particularly his shape-shifting, [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] backgrounds, lack of respect for convention and his irreverence, is evident in the work of [[Robert Crumb]],{{sfnm|1a1=Estren|1y=1974|1pp=30–31|2a1=Hignite|2y=2006|2p=20}} [[Denis Kitchen]], and [[Bobby London]].{{sfn|Estren|1974|pp=28, 30–31}}  Journalist Paul Krassner called Crumb "the illegitimate offspring of ''Krazy Kat''".{{sfn|Estren|1974|p=30}} Cartoonist [[Chris Ware]] was so taken with Herriman's work he made a pilgrimage to Monument Valley to see the desert landscapes that inspired much of Herriman's art.{{sfn|Heer|2010|p=3}}

Within the seeming strictures of the strip—the recurring characters, the Krazy–Ignatz–Offisa Pupp love triangle—Herriman improvised freely with the story, the shifting backgrounds, and the sex of the ''Krazy Kat''{{'}}s title character.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|pp=147–148}}  Among the multicultural influences Herriman mixed in his work were those of the Navajo{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=147}} and Mexican.{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|pp=78–79}}  He made creative use of language{{sfnm|1a1=Berger|1y=1996|1p=124|2a1=Estren|2y=1974|2p=112|3a1=Ito|3y=2003}} with a poetical sense,{{sfnm|1a1=Waugh|1y=1947|1p=57|2a1=Johnson|2y=1999|2p=208}} employing multilingual puns{{sfn|Baetens|2012|p=109}} in a fanciful mix of dialects from different ethnic backgrounds.{{sfnm|1a1=Anderson|1y=1999|1p=159|2a1=McDonnell|2a2=O'Connell|2a3=Havenon|2y=1986|2p=63}}  Herriman used [[metafiction]]al techniques associated with [[postmodernism]];{{sfn|Soper|2008|p=83}} his characters were self-aware,{{sfn|Johnson|1999|p=208}} he frequently drew attention to himself and his drawings as drawings in his strips, and he emphasized the subjectivity of language and experience.{{sfn|Soper|2008|p=83}}

|3   = Herriman played with page structures, as with this circular panel, surrounded by borderless panels.  He drew with a loose, spontaneous line, and had his characters speak in dialect-heavy, poetic dialogue.
|alt = A circular panel from a comic strip, surrounded by borderless panels.  Within the circular panel, from left to right, are an anthropomorphic stork, mouse, and cat.  The stork to the left says, "Pause, 'Ignatz', Pause!!  What 'Krazy' says is true, they are twins—hark to the tale I will tell you—."  The cat, hands on its hips, says in dialect speech, "Oh, I'm so gled, Mr. Stork, y'see 'Ignatz' is such a skeptikle l'il chep, he doubts me." ["Oh, I'm so glad, Mr. Stork, you see 'Ignatz' is such a skeptical little chap, he doubts me."]}}

Herriman drew with what cartoonist Edward Sorel called a "liberated, spontaneous-looking style&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;a cartoon counterpart of [[expressionism]]".{{sfn|Sorel|1992|p=25}}  It was organic, and his pen strokes had a dynamic, thick-and-thin range which Sorel describes as instantly recognizable and difficult to imitate.  The ''Krazy Kat'' Sunday pages showed Herriman experimenting most freely—each had a unique panel layout and logo,{{sfn|Sorel|1992|p=25}} and the jumbled panels could be circles, irregular shapes, or borderless.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=152}}  In his last few years, Herriman's arthritis led to an ever-scratchier style of art; he used a knife to scratch out whites from inked surfaces, giving the artwork the look of a [[woodcut]].{{sfn|McDonnell|O'Connell|Havenon|1986|p=85}}

''Krazy Kat'' has been [[Krazy Kat#Reprints and compilations|collected]] in a variety of formats over the years, though Herriman's other strips have been less frequently reprinted.  ''George Herriman's Krazy Kat'' (1946) was the first ''Krazy Kat'' collection;{{sfn|Tashlin|1946}} it featured an introduction by poet {{not a typo|[[E.&amp;nbsp;E. Cummings]]}}.{{efn|Cummings had attended [[Harvard University]] with Gilbert Seldes.{{sfn|Gabilliet|Beaty|Nguyen|2010|pp=287}} }}{{sfnm|1a1=McDonnell|1a2=O'Connell|1a3=Havenon|1y=1986|1p=221|2a1=Boxer|2y=2012}}  Comics historian Bill Blackbeard began compiling a complete collection of ''Krazy Kat'' Sundays beginning in 1988, but the publisher [[Eclipse Comics]] went bankrupt in 1992, before the series was complete.{{sfnm|1a1=Heer|1y=2010|1pp=13|2a1=Bloom|2y=2003}}  Blackbeard's thirteen-volume{{sfn|Boxer|2012}} ''Krazy and Ignatz'' series was published by [[Fantagraphics Books]] beginning in 2002, and was designed by Chris Ware.{{sfn|Heer|2010|pp=10–11}}&lt;!--  Reprinted in this series were also ''Us Husbands'', ''Little Tommy Tattles'' and ''Mrs. Waitaminnit''.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}--&gt;  In 2010, Sunday Press Books released ''Krazy Kat: A Celebration of Sundays'', which reprinted a selection of ''Krazy Kat'' Sundays and some of Herriman's pre-''Krazy Kat'' work in a {{convert|14|×|17|in|cm|adj=on}} format, which approximated the original printed size of the strips.{{sfn|Mautner|2011}}  In 2012, IDW began issuing a three-volume ''Baron Bean'' reprinting,{{sfn|Comic Book Resources staff|2012}} and Fantagraphics will release ''George Herriman's Stumble Inn''.{{sfn|Cornog|2012}}  Fantagraphics has also announced plans to collect the complete ''Krazy Kat'' dailies at an unspecified time.{{sfn|Mautner|2011}}

|3   = Herriman had many long– and short-lived comic strips.  (''[[Baron Bean]]'' daily, {{circa|1916–1917}})
|alt = In a four-panel comic strip, a short man dressed as a clown tells a tall man seated at a table that he must dine alone, as the short man is going out to supper. The tall man's negro cook tells him she has eaten his meal herself and he falls out of his chair in surprise. The short man returns and boasts of his fine supper, and the tall man, with a cat-and-mouse comic strip in mind, prepares top throw a brick at him.}}
