'''George Lichty''' (May 16, 1905 – July 18, 1983) was an American [[cartoonist]], creator of the [[daily strip|daily]] and [[Sunday strip|Sunday cartoon series]] ''[[Grin and Bear It]]''. His work was signed '''Lichty''' and often ran without mention of his first name. 

== Biography ==
Born '''George Maurice Lichtenstein''' to Julius and Ella Hirsh Lichtenstein in [[Chicago, Illinois]], Lichty was 16 years old when he launched his art career by selling his first cartoon to ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]''. He attended the [[Chicago Art Institute]] (1924–25) and was the editor of the [[University of Michigan]]'s humor magazine, ''[[Gargoyle Humor Magazine|The Gargoyle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askart.com/askart/l/george_maurice_lichty/george_maurice_lichty.aspx Ask Art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicstripfan.com/newspaper/g/grinandbearit.htm ''Contemporary Authors'']&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating from the University of Michigan in 1929, he began his newspaper career doing spot cartoons and sports drawings for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times|Chicago Daily Times]]''. Lichty and Eleanor Louise Fretter married on January 5, 1931.

===''Grin and Bear It''===
[[File:Grinbearit1942.jpg|right|260px|thumb|Dell's ''Grin and Bear It'' (1942)]]
After he created his ''[[Grin and Bear It]]'' series in 1932, it was syndicated at first by [[United Feature Syndicate]] and later by the [[Field Newspaper Syndicate]] in Chicago. Lichty also contributed to ''[[Collier's]]'' during the 1930s. His artwork had a hastily drawn, loose appearance. Frequent subjects included computers, family life, excessive capitalism and Soviet bureaucracy. Scenes in his cartoons were often set in the offices of commissars or the showrooms of "Belchfire" dealers with enormous cars in the background. His series ''Is Party Line, Comrade!'' also skewered various Soviet bureaucrats, who usually were drawn wearing a five-pointed star medal labeled "Hero".  The "gags" for ''Grin and Bear It'' were written by [[Arthur Erenberg]];{{cn|date=December 2017}} he would describe the scene and write the joke and then Lichty would draw the cartoon.

A member of the San Francisco Press Club, Lichty performed as a percussionist with the [[Guckenheimer Sour Kraut Band]]. Lichty lived with his wife and their two daughters in [[Santa Rosa, California]], and later on Apple Ranch in [[Sebastopol, California]]. At age 78, he died July 18, 1983 of a heart attack in the Santa Rosa Hospital in [[Santa Rosa, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuben.org/ncs/members/memorium/lichty.jpg National Cartoonists Society: George Lichty]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and influence==
Lichty was a four-time winner of the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award. ''Grin and Bear It'' received this award in 1956, 1960, 1962 and 1964.

Lichty's cartoon style had an influence on cartoon animation in what was known as the "animation smear technique," dubbed the "Lichty style" by [[Warner Bros.]] animator [[Rod Scribner]]. Lichty also influenced cartoons drawn by Joe Teller, as evidenced in the book, ''"When I'm Dead All This Will Be Yours!": Joe Teller&amp;mdash;A Portrait by His Kid'' (2000) by [[Teller (magician)|Teller]] (of [[Penn &amp; Teller]]). The artist [[Ed Ruscha]], who originally planned to be a cartoonist, incorporated a Lichty cartoon into one of his artworks.
