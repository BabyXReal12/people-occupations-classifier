      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6299">'''Larry Feign''' (born December 5, 1955) is an American cartoonist and writer based in Hong Kong, best known for his comic strip ''[[The World of Lily Wong]]''. He attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Goddard College]] in [[Plainfield, Vermont]], graduating with a B.A. in 1979, and received an MFA in Creative Writing from [[Pacific University]] in [[Forest Grove, Oregon]] in 2012.

His earliest comic-strip character was known as "Hoiman the Mouse", which he created as the mascot for ''Dum'', a mimeographed magazine produced a few times per year with several collaborators in primary school. Later he co-created "Billy Wizard", which began as a collaboration in high school with Jon Tschirgi, but he continued it alone throughout college. Billy Wizard was also the mascot of a bootleg vinyl record label, "Wizardo Rekords". He and Tschirgi also formed a rock band which released one LP record in 1976 under the name The B. Toff Band, and a 45 rpm single in 1978 under the name Billy Wizard.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Feign started cartooning professionally in 1980 in [[Honolulu]], where he worked as a caricature artist in the International Marketplace. In 1983, he moved to Los Angeles and worked for the animation studio DIC Productions as a storyboard artist for the "Heathcliff the Cat" animated television series. In 1985, he moved to Hong Kong, where he created a feature called "Aieeyaaa!", a satirical Chinese-word-a-day single-panel cartoon, which ran daily in the ''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|Hongkong Standard]]'' for one year. He terminated the feature when he started producing ''[[The World of Lily Wong]]'' for the same newspaper.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

''The World of Lily Wong'' appeared in ''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]'' from November 1986 to December 1987; the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' between January 1987 and May 1995; ''[[The Independent]]'' (UK) between March 1997 and June 1997 (to chronicle the final hundred days of British rule in Hong Kong); and the ''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|HK iMail]]'' from May 2000 until September 2001. In July 1997, Lily Wong appeared in a special Hong Kong handover edition of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], the first full-page cartoon editorial in the magazine's history. Lily Wong also appeared in syndication in [[Malaysia]]'s ''New Straits Times'' from 1991 to 1998, and individually in numerous periodicals and books around the world.

The abrupt cancellation of ''Lily Wong'' by the ''South China Morning Post'' in May 1995, following a series of cartoons deemed offensive to the Beijing leadership, garnered international attention as the most high-profile case of media [[self-censorship]] in the years preceding Hong Kong's handover to the [[People's Republic of China]]. Letters to the editor written by then [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democrat]] leader [[Martin Lee]] and others were never published.&lt;ref name="Censorship"&gt;Kees Kuiken, "Larry Feign", ''Censorship: a World Encyclopedia.'' 2002. [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]], [[Oxfordshire|Oxon]]: [[Routledge]], Retrieved 2017-06-06 from [https://books.google.com/books?id=nzisCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2981 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1998-2000 Feign lived in London, where he produced a weekly political comic strip for ''Time'' magazine's international editions, as well as a comic strip known as ''The Royals'', satirizing the antics of the British Royal Family. He also illustrated for ''The Economist'', ''Fortune'', and other publications.

Feign's cartoons have appeared in numerous publications around the world and received several international awards,&lt;ref&gt;[[Rey Chow]], "Larry Feign, Ethnographer of a 'Lifestyle': Political Cartoons from Hong Kong", ''boundary 2'', Vol. 24, No. 2. (Summer, 1997), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wittyworld.com/whoswho/whoswho-F.html Witty World] International Who is Who in Cartooning, retrieved 8/7/07&lt;/ref&gt; including three from [[Amnesty International]].

Feign's cartoons and other writings have been compiled into many books. He has also produced animation for [[Walt Disney Television]], [[Cartoon Network]] and others, and writes for various magazines in Hong Kong, where he still lives. His latest book, a collection of cartoons and essays entitled ''A Politically Incorrect History of Hong Kong'', was published in 2017. In 2011 he received a literature fellowship from the [[MacDowell Colony]] in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]]. He is married to psychologist and author Dr. Cathy Tsang-Feign.&lt;ref name="Censorship"/&gt;
