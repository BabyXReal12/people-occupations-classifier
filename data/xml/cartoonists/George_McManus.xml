'''George McManus''' (January 23, 1884 &amp;ndash; October 22, 1954) was an [[United States|American]] [[cartoonist]] best known as the creator of Irish immigrant Jiggs and his wife Maggie, the main characters of his syndicated [[comic strip]], ''[[Bringing Up Father]]''. 

==Biography==
[[File:Photo_of_George_McManus_and_sketch_of_his_wife,_put_together_by_Marguerite_Martyn,_1910.jpg|thumb|right|George McManus and Florence Bergere; composite by [[Marguerite Martyn]] for the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch,'' 1910]]
Born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] of Irish parents, McManus had an innate gift for drawing and a sense of humor. He recalled an incident when he was in high school: "My teacher sent home to my parents a picture I had drawn of a classmate named Sweeney. '''This'' is what your boy has been doing,' the teacher wrote, icily. I laid the note in Pop's lap and headed wearily for the woodshed. But Pop, instead, put on his hat and coat and went to the editor of ''The Republican''. He showed [my drawing of] Sweeney to the editor. Next day I had a job on ''The Republican'' at $5 a weekâ€”as an errand boy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lileks.com/comics/kingfeatures/32b.html |title=Famous Artists &amp; Writers-George McManus |publisher=King Features Syndicate |year=1949 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408034747/http://www.lileks.com/comics/kingfeatures/32b.html |archivedate=April 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At ''The Republican'', he created his first comic strip, ''Alma and Oliver''. In 1904, after winning $3000 at the racetrack, he went to [[New York City]] and a job with the prestigious ''[[New York World]]'', where he worked on several short-lived comic strips, including  ''Snoozer'', ''The Merry Marcelene'', ''Ready Money Ladies'', ''Cheerful Charlie'', ''Nibsby the Newsboy in Funny Fairyland'', ''Panhandle Pete'' and ''Let George Do It''.&lt;ref name=don&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/nibsy.htm Don Markstein's Toonopedia: ''Nibsy the Newsboy in Funny Fairyland'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lam&gt;[http://lambiek.net/artists/m/mcmanus.htm Lambiek]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comic strip evolution==

In 1904, McManus created the first American family comic strip, ''The Newlyweds'', about an elegant young couple and their baby Snookums. The popularity of the strip prompted the management of ''[[New York Journal American|The New York American]]'' to invite McManus to work for their newspaper, which he did from 1912 on. Renaming ''The Newlyweds'' as ''Their Only Child'', he continued that strip and began other daily strips: ''Rosie's Beau'', ''Love Affairs of a Mutton Head'', ''Spareribs And Gravy'' and ''Bringing Up Father''.&lt;ref name=lam/&gt;

Syndicated internationally by [[King Features Syndicate]], ''Bringing Up Father'' achieved great success and was produced by McManus from 1913 until his death, when [[Vernon Greene]] and Frank Fletcher replaced him. McManus was inspired by ''The Rising Generation'', a musical comedy by William Gill that he had seen as a boy in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]'s Grand Opera House, where his father was manager. In ''The Rising Generation'', Irish-American bricklayer Martin McShayne (played by the fat Irish comedian Billy Barry in the stage production McManus saw) becomes a wealthy contractor, yet his society-minded wife and daughter were ashamed of him and his buddies, prompting McShayne to sneak out to join his pals for poker. McManus knew Barry and used him as the basis for his drawings of Jiggs.  Two years before his death, McManus said that ''Bringing Up Father'' had earned him $12,000,000 during his lifetime.

McManus' wife, the former Florence Bergere, was the model for daughter Nora in ''Bringing Up Father''. [[Zeke Zekley]] was his assistant on the comic strip from 1935 to 1954.

==Awards==
For his contribution to American humor, [[Roanoke College]] honored McManus with an honorary degree, Doctor of Humane Letters.

==Later life==
During the 1940s, McManus lived at 8905 Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. He died in 1954 in [[Santa Monica, California]] and was interred in the [[Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx, New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PW8xAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MRAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1870,2684491&amp;dq=king-features-syndicate&amp;hl=en "'Jiggs' Creator, McManus, Dies", ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'', October 22, 1954.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural legacy==
Jiggs serves as insignia of the [[U.S. Air Force]]'s [[11th Bomb Squadron]], with whom McManus served during [[World War I]]. In 1995, the comic strip was one of 20 included in the "Comic Strip Classics" series of commemorative United States [[postage stamps]].
