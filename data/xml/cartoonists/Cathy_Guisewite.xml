'''Cathy Lee Guisewite''' (born September 5, 1950) is an American [[cartoonist]] who created the [[comic strip]] ''[[Cathy (comic strip)|Cathy]]'', which had a 34-year run. The strip focused on a career woman facing the issues and challenges of eating, work, relationships and having a mother—or as the character put it in one strip, "the four basic guilt groups."

==Early life==
Guisewite was born in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]]&lt;ref name= INT /&gt; to William L. and Anne Guisewite. She was raised in [[Midland, Michigan|Midland]], [[Michigan]] with older sister [http://fineartamerica.com/profiles/mary-anne-nagy.html?tab=artwork Mary Anne Nagy] and younger sister Mickey. Guisewite graduated from [[Midland High School (Midland, Michigan)|Midland High School]] in 1968. 

She attended the [[University of Michigan]] at [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], where she was a member of the [[Delta Delta Delta]] [[sorority]].  In 1972, she earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[English language|English]].

==Career==
After college, Guisewite followed her father's vocation and began working in [[advertising]]&lt;ref name=INT&gt;{{cite web |last= Heintjes| first= Tom| title= The Cathy Guisewite Interview|work= Hogan's Alley|date=April 24, 2012|url=http://cartoonician.com/cathy-guisewite-the-goodbye-girl/|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Campbell-Ewald]], then Norman Prady before settling at [[Doner Company|W.B. Doner &amp; Co.]] near [[Detroit]]. She became a vice president of the firm in 1976.&lt;ref name=ANSWER&gt;{{cite web |title=Cathy Lee Guisewite|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/cathy-guisewite|website= Answers.com |publisher= Gale Encyclopedia of Biography|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Guisewite's first cartoon strip ''Roxbury'' (syndicated by Copley News Service for Early Cartoons) was published from 1963 to 1973. REMOVED --  no reference, and if she was so flabbergasted to be published with _Cathy_, it doesn't make that much sense she would have already had a long-running title.--&gt;
She continued to draw funny pictures as an "emotional coping mechanism" to events in her life and work, and she would forward them to her parents.&lt;ref name=INT /&gt; Her mother kept urging her to send them to a publisher, so finally, she did. "My entire goal with my submission package was to get my mother off my back. My goal was not to do a comic strip. It was to make Mom quit telling me I could do a comic strip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview| first= Cathy| last= Guisewite| url= http://cartoonician.com/cathy-guisewite-the-goodbye-girl/| work= Hogan's Alley| title= The Cathy Guisewite Interview| date= April 24, 2012 |interviewer= Tom Heintjes| access-date= September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guisewite was flabbergasted when the company sent her a contract to produce a comic strip. ''[[Cathy]]'' was [[Print syndication|syndicated]] to 66 newspapers in 1976&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;{{cite news|last=Sweeney|first=Louise|title=When life becomes a comic strip|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0313/031358.html|accessdate=6 August 2013|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=March 13, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by [[Universal Press Syndicate]], now [[Universal Uclick]],&lt;ref name= quits /&gt; and Guisewite did both—her advertising job during the day, and comics at night. By 1980, the strip was carried by 150 dailies and she was earning $50,000 per year for ''Cathy'',&lt;ref name=CSM /&gt; so she finally quit the advertising business to work on ''Cathy'' full-time and moved to [[Santa Barbara, California]].&lt;ref name=INT /&gt;

The comic strip was a "running social commentary"&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Peters|first=Jeremy W.|title=Swimsuit Season’s Over. For Good.| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/business/media/16cathy.html?_r=0|accessdate=5 August 2013|newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for her confusion. Guisewite explained, "You were a liberated woman or you were or a traditionalist. To even voice vulnerability if you were a feminist was wrong and to voice interest in liberation if you were a more traditional woman was wrong. So I believe the women I was speaking to in the early years of my strip were women like me, who were at that age in our 20s where we were kind of launched into adulthood with a foot in both worlds and no way to really express it.”&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; 

Guisewite appeared several times as a guest on the late night TV series ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.&lt;ref name=IMDB&gt;{{imdb name|0347535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peak of the strip's popularity in the mid-1990s, it appeared in almost 1,400 papers.&lt;ref name=INT /&gt; However, on August 11, 2010, Guisewite announced the strip's retirement after 34 years. Its run ended on October 3, 2010 (a [[Sunday comics|Sunday strip]]).&lt;ref name=quits&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20100811/us-cathy-calls-it-quits/| work= [[Huffington Post]] | title= 'Cathy' comic strip ending after 34 years| first= Maria | last= Sudekum Fisher| date= August 11, 2010| agency= [[Associated Press|AP]]| access-date= September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/28/AR2010092801689.html?wprss=rss_health&amp;sid=ST2010092801746|title=Cathy Guisewite, creator of 'Cathy' comic, on weight| first=Jennifer |last= LaRue Huget|date=September 30, 2010|work=Washington Post|accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 1987, she received an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding [[Animated]] Program for the TV special ''[[Cathy (TV special)|Cathy]]'', which aired on [[CBS]]. 

Guisewite is a member of the [[National Cartoonists Society]] and received in 1993 their highest honor, the [[Reuben Award]] for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year for her work of 1992.

Guisewite has been granted three [[honorary degree]]s from [[Russell Sage College]], [[Rhode Island College]] and [[Eastern Michigan University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEunCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;ots=s03uXY4t8D&amp;dq=rhode%20island%20college%20guisewite&amp;pg=PA181#v=onepage&amp;q=rhode%20island%20college%20guisewite&amp;f=false|title=Comic Strip Artists in American Newspapers, 1945-1980|last=Reynolds|first=Moira Davison|date=2003-02-18|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786415519|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==

Guisewite adopted daughter Ivy in 1992, then married screenwriter [[Christopher Wilkinson]] in 1997. Wilkinson has a son, Cooper, but the couple had no children together.&lt;ref name=NCS&gt;{{cite web|title=Member Bios: Cathy Guisewite|url=http://www.reuben.org/ncs/members/bios/Guisewite.jpg|publisher=National Cartoonists Society|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PEOPLE&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=Deirdre|title=Passages|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20451644,00.html|accessdate=5 August 2013|newspaper=People|date=December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guisewite and Wilkinson divorced in 2010.&lt;ref name="PEOPLE" /&gt;  

One of Guisewite's classmates at University of Michigan was screenwriter [[Lawrence Kasdan]]. When Kasdan's movie ''[[The Big Chill (film)|The Big Chill]]'' (1983) opened, Guisewite devoted an entire week of ''Cathy'' strips to it, with Cathy and her co-workers enthusing over the film and seeing it repeatedly.
