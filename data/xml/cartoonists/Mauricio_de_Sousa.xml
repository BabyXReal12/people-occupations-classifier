'''Mauricio Araújo de Sousa''' ({{IPA-pt|mawˈɾisju dʒi ˈsowzɐ}}{{#tag:ref|Also generally {{IPA-pt|məwˈɾisju ˈtsoːzɐ|}} in fast, colloquial speech.|group=nb}} born October 27, 1935) is a Brazilian [[cartoonist]] who has created over 200 characters for his popular series of children's comic books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel Balderston |author2=Mike Gonzalez |author3=Ana M.

At 17 years of age, he worked for a daily newspaper called ''[[Folha de S. Paulo|Folha da Manhã]]'' as a crime reporter. In 1959, Sousa quit that job and began his comic book career, and created ''[[Monica's Gang]]''. Sousa's characters were inspired by children he knew from his childhood and by his own children. His later style is slightly reminiscent of that of [[Osamu Tezuka]], a famous Japanese [[Mangaka|manga artist]] and personal friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.conradeditora.com.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=425 |title=Conrad Editora – Mauricio de Sousa fala sobre seu "grande mestre", Osamu Tezuka |access-date=March 21, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504164912/http://www.conradeditora.com.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=425 |archive-date=May 4, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Mauricio Araújo de Sousa was born in Santa Isabel on October 27, 1935. His father, Antonio Mauricio de Sousa, is a poet and his mother, Petronilha Araújo de Sousa, also delved into poetry. Mauricio developed an interest in cartooning at a young age, and began to draw posters and illustrations for periodicals.&lt;ref name=ecia/&gt; At 17 years of age, he worked for a daily newspaper called ''[[Folha de S. Paulo|Folha da Manhã]]'' as a crime reporter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monica.com.br/ingles/index.htm Mauricio de Sousa – The Cartoonist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229074037/http://www.monica.com.br/ingles/index.htm |date=December 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ecia&gt;{{cite web|title=Os 80 anos de Maurício de Sousa|url=http://portaldosjornalistas.com.br/noticia/os-80-anos-mauricio-sousa|website=Jornalistas &amp; Cia|accessdate=29 October 2015|language=Portuguese|date=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Sousa quit that job and began his comic book career, and created ''[[Monica's Gang]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferreira|first1=Luana|title=The cartoonist called the 'Walt Disney of Brazil'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37284939|accessdate=12 September 2016|agency=BBC News|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comics of Mauricio de Sousa have gained international fame, been featured on licensed merchandise, and have even been adapted for movies, television, video games, and even a São Paulo amusement park, the ''[[Monica's Gang#Parque da Mônica|Parque da Mônica]]'' ("Monica's Park"). Two other ''Parque da Mônica'' facilities were also located in Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro, but they both closed in 2000 and 2005, respectively. From 1970 to 1986, Mauricio's comic books had been published by Editora Abril, until Globo took over in January 1987. His work has been published in many magazines and newspapers since 1959. Since January 2007, the comic book series is published by Panini Comics.

In 1997, the cartoonist founded the Mauricio de Sousa Cultural Institute, whose mandate is to develop social action campaigns that translate serious subjects into a comic book format to appeal to both young and adult readers.

Mauricio started publishing ''Turma da Mônica Jovem'' ("[[Monica Teen]]") in 2008, an offshoot series from "[[Monica's Gang]]", featuring Monica and her friends now as teenagers, adopting black-and-white pages, as well as art style heavily influenced from [[manga]]. Issue #34 of the "Monica Teen" comic book, presenting the first real kiss between Monica and Jimmy (they had already kissed in two previous occasions, but in a different context) had 500,000 sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rich |last=Johnston |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/09/13/this-is-what-a-half-million-selling-american-comic-looks-like/ |title=This Is What A Half-Million-Selling American Comic Book Looks Like |publisher=[[Bleeding Cool]] |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=February 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Mauricio  published a two-issue story arc in the [[Monica Teen]] comic book featuring some of [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s main characters, such as [[Astro Boy (character)|Astro]], [[Princess Knight|Sapphire]] and [[Kimba the White Lion|Kimba]], joining Monica and her friends in an adventure in the [[Amazon rainforest]] against a smuggling organization chopping down hundreds of trees in the jungles of the Amazon. This is the first time that [[Tezuka Productions]] has allowed overseas animators to use Tezuka's characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ari |last=Hirayama |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/AJ201202010008 |title=Brazilian cartoonist to publish manga with Osamu Tezuka |publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |date=February 1, 2012 |accessdate=February 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729085553/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/AJ201202010008 |archivedate=July 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rock (manga character)|Rock Holmes]], another character created by Tezuka, has featured as a villain in the story arc.

==Awards==
Mauricio's public service work has earned him international recognition. Among the honors he has received are the Brazilian presidential medal of honor for his promotion of human rights; an honorary doctorate in public service from La Roche College of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Brazilian International Press Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paho.org/english/dd/pin/Number19_article04.htm|title=Toon in Monica|publisher=Perspectives in Health – Volume 9, Number 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he was honored in the seventh edition of the [[Festival Internacional de Quadrinhos]], at [[Belo Horizonte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entretenimento.uol.com.br/album/fiq_2011_album.htm |title=Sétima edição do Festival Internacional de Quadrinhos homenageia Mauricio de Sousa |publisher=UOL |date=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
