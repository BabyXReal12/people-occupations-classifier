'''William Aloysius Keane''' (October 5, 1922&amp;nbsp;– November 8, 2011), better known as '''Bil Keane''', was an American [[cartoonist]] most notable for his work on the newspaper comic ''[[The Family Circus]]''. It began in 1960 and continues in syndication, drawn by his son [[Jeff Keane]].&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h46uwJiZg9NRKogBtxRuuGRJ_U9g?docId=013c6c817550450aa2d1449a009e702e |title=The Associated Press: 'Family Circus' creator Bil Keane dies at 89 |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/10/family-circus-creator-bil-keane-dies/ |title=CNN The Marquee Blog: 'Family Circus' creator Bil Keane dies |publisher=cnn.com |date=2011-11-10 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Keane was born in the [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] neighborhood of [[Crescentville, Philadelphia|Crescentville]] and attended [[parochial school]] at [[St. William Parish (Lawncrest)|St. William Parish]] and [[Northeast Catholic High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://catholicreview.org/article/life/life-news/bil-keane-creator-of-family-circus-comic-strip-dies-at-age-89 | title=Bil Keane, creator of ‘Family Circus’ comic strip, dies at age 89 | newspaper=The Catholic Review | date=November 12, 2011 | accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a schoolboy, he taught himself to draw by mimicking the style of the cartoons published in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | title=Cartoonist chronicled the lighter moments of family life for more than 50 years through gentle, heartfelt humor | date=November 10, 2011 | first=Valerie J. | last=Nelson | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/10/local/la-me-bil-keane-20111110 | accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first cartoon was published on May 21, 1936 on the amateur page of the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familycircus.com/art/hs/hist15a.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212003530/http://www.familycircus.com/art/hs/hist15a.html |archivedate=2006-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While in high school, his in-comic signature was spelled "Bill Keane",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familycircus.com/art/hs/images/hist15a.gif|title=Keane's high school work|accessdate=5 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309102349/http://www.familycircus.com/art/hs/images/hist15a.gif|archivedate=9 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but early in his career, he omitted the second L from his first name "to be distinctive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.baptistlifeonline.org/files/pdfs/03/11/Nov03.pdf|title=The Gospel according to Bil Keane|journal=Baptist Life|volume=87|number=10|page=5|first=Kathi|last=Wolfe|date=November 2003|accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Keane served in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] from 1942 to 1945, drawing for ''[[Yank (newspaper)|Yank]]'' and creating the "At Ease with the Japanese" feature for the Pacific edition of ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]''.

Keane worked for the ''[[Philadelphia Bulletin]]'' as a staff artist from 1946 to 1959, where he launched his first regular comic strip ''[[Silly Philly]]''. His first syndicated strip, ''[[Channel Chuckles]]'', a series of jokes related to television, premiered in 1954 and ran until 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Keane, p.8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1959, the Keane family moved to [[Paradise Valley, Arizona]]. Keane's daily newspaper panel ''The Family Circus'' premiered on February 29, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Keane, p.21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keane was the president of the [[National Cartoonists Society]] from 1981 to 1983 and was the emcee of the Society's annual awards banquet for 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.reuben.org/ |  title=Bil Keane, 1922-2011 | first=Tom | last=Richmond | date=November 9, 2011 | authorlink=Tom Richmond (illustrator) | work=News From The NCS | publisher=National Cartoonist Society | accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1981 to 1983, Keane published the gag strip ''Eggheads'' in collaboration with his son Jeff, who now draws and writes ''The Family Circus'' and continues the strip with his own insight and humor. Like his father, Jeff Keane has been president of the National Cartoonists Society (NCS), serving two consecutive terms (four years).&lt;ref&gt;http://dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2011/06/17/jeff-keane-reflects-on-four-years-as-ncs-president/&lt;/ref&gt;  The NCS is the organizing body that honors cartoonists with the [[Reuben Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;Keane, Christopher, [https://books.google.com/books?id=olhEMU5PeE4C&amp;pg=PA290&amp;lpg=PA290&amp;dq=%22Christopher+Keane%22+Family+Circus&amp;source=web&amp;ots=pfqFSHmEbY&amp;sig=ayMeMWL9KPH2DeN0FCa6ULLduK8&amp;hl=en#PPA285,M1 ''Family Circus: The Next Generation''], Cartoon Profiles, Issue No. 127, pg. 11, September 2000, Retrieved 2008-05-26&lt;/ref&gt;

Bil Keane died on November 8, 2011, at his home in [[Paradise Valley, Arizona]] (near [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]), at 89.  The cause of death was given as [[congestive heart failure]].&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;

==Personal life==
While stationed in Australia he met [[Thelma Keane|Thelma "Thel" Carne]].&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite news |first=Amanda Lee |last=Meyers |title=Thelma Keane; Wife Of Cartoonist Bil Keane |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/26/AR2008052602129.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=May 27, 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bil and Thel were married in [[Brisbane, Queensland]] in 1948&lt;ref name=wp/&gt; and settled in [[Roslyn, Pennsylvania]]. Thel, the inspiration for the "Mommy" character in his long-running strip, died on May 23, 2008, from complications of [[Alzheimer's Disease]].&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;&lt;ref name=MeyersAL-AP-2008-05-25&gt;{{citation |author=Meyers, Amanda Lee |url=http://www.chron.com/life/article/Inspiration-for-Family-Circus-Mommy-dies-at-82-1753703.php |title=Inspiration for 'Family Circus' Mommy dies at 82 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=May 25, 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had five children, Gayle, Neal, [[Glen Keane|Glen]], Christopher and [[Jeff Keane|Jeff]]. Glen works as an [[animator]] for Disney and Jeff is a cartoonist, having taken over his father's comic strip.

==Awards==
Keane was a four-time recipient of the National Cartoonists Society's Award for Best Syndicated Panel, winning in 1967, 1971, 1973 and 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, Keane was named the Society's Cartoonist of the Year and received its top honor, the [[Reuben Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; He also received the [[National Cartoonists Society#Elzie Segar Award|Elzie Segar Award]] in 1982 for his unique contribution to the cartooning profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Keane was honored with the [[National Cartoonists Society#Silver T-Square Award|Silver T-Square Award]] from the National Cartoonist Society in 2002 for "outstanding dedication" to the Society and the cartooning profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1998, he became the tenth recipient of the Arizona Heritage Award, joining—among others—[[Barry Goldwater]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[Mo Udall]] and [[Erma Bombeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Family Circus artist still draws: Arizona Heritage Award notes contributions | first=Michael | last=Grady | date=December 29, 1998 | newspaper=[[Dallas Morning News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Friends==
Keane had a close friendship with humorist, newspaper columnist [[Erma Bombeck]]. Keane provided illustrations for Bombeck's book ''Just Wait Until You Have Children of Your Own!'' (1972), and considered himself instrumental in convincing Bombeck and her family to move to Arizona near his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/messenger/nov2001/feature1.asp|title=Bil Keane's Family Circus - November 2001 Issue of St. Anthony Messenger Magazine Online|work=americancatholic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, he was a pall bearer at Bombeck's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=894&amp;dat=19960430&amp;id=qxoOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iH0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4413,3938211|title=The Daily Courier - Google News Archive Search|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephan Pastis]], creator of ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comic strip)|Pearls Before Swine]]'', acknowledged he was good friends with Keane and Keane's son, Jeff.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Pastis, [http://stephanpastis.wordpress.com/2009/07/28/and-now-a-few-words-from-the-creator-of-one-of-the-worlds-most-beloved-family-friendly-comics/ "And Now a Few Words From the Creator of One of the World’s Most Beloved Family Comics"], ''Official Pearls Before Swine Blog'', stephanpastis.wordpress.com, 28, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Pastis has notably parodied ''The Family Circus'' in his own strip a number of times, and Keane wrote a satirical "attack" on these jokes as a foreword for Pastis' ''Pearls'' collection ''[[List of Pearls Before Swine books|Macho Macho Animals]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Pastis, ''Pearls Sells Out: A Pearls Before Swine Treasury'', Andrews McMeel Publishing (18 Aug 2009), p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Keane switched with [[Scott Adams]] of ''[[Dilbert]]'' in the 1997 [[comic strip switcheroo]].&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Zitz | title=April Fools: This is some funny business | newspaper=The Free Lance Star | date=April 1, 1997 | page=D1 | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7-kyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1QcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6675,104675&amp;dq=zippy+family+circus&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams said, "Bil was a misunderstood creative genius who knew how to write for his target audience. He was also a great guy. I was a big fan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tcj.com/a-ringmaster-dies-bil-keane-1922-2011/ | title=A Ringmaster Dies Bil Keane 1922-2011 | first=R.C. | last=Harvey | newspaper=The Comics Journal | date=November 16, 2011 | accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keane also counted fellow cartoonists [[Charles M. Schulz]] (''[[Peanuts]]'') and [[Mell Lazarus]] (''Miss Peach, Momma'') as close friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=‘Family Circus’ creator Bil Keane dies at 89 | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/nov/9/family-circus-creator-bil-keane-dies-at-89/ | publisher=The Washington Times | date=November 9, 2011 | last=Myers | first=Amanda Lee | accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= ‘Lio’s’ artful Bil Keane tribute | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/cartoon-of-the-day-lios-artful-bil-keane-tribute/2011/11/21/gIQAwATojN_blog.html | first=Michael | last=Cavna | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=November 21, 2012 | accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 the characters from The Family Circus made a "guest appearance" in [[Bill Griffith]]'s ''[[Zippy the Pinhead]]'' comic strip. Griffith sad, "I remembered Bil’s affection for Zippy, so I decided to bite the bullet and call him to ask if, instead of me parodying his strip, he’d agree to jam with me..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Bill | last=Griffith | title=Bil Keane: An Appreciation  | newspaper=The Comics Journal | date=November 14, 2011 | url=http://www.tcj.com/bil-keane-an-appreciation/ | accessdate=2008-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters were drawn into the strip by Keane, but the dialog was written by Griffith. Then, on March 7, 1995, Zippy made an appearance in a Family Circus panel, drawn in by Bill Griffith. Griffith said ''Family Circus'' was "the last remaining folk art strip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Historically Speaking: ‘Family Circus’ cartoonist respected by his peers | url=http://www.norwichbulletin.com/newsnow/x1112597999/Historically-Speaking-Family-Circus-cartoonist-respected-by-his-peers#axzz2CLt2kL6A | first=Richard | last=Curland | newspaper=Norwich Bulletin | date=December 3, 2011 | accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith said, "It's supposed to be the epitome of squareness, but it turns the corner into a hip zone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Pat | last=Seremet | title=Zippy and The Family Circus--Together again!! | newspaper=The Hartford Courant | date=July 11, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
