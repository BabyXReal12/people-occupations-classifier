'''Stanley John Joseph Pitt''' (2 March 1925 – 2 April 2002) was an Australian cartoonist and commercial artist. Pitt was the first Australian [[comic book artist|comic artist]] to have original work published by a major [[American comic book]] company.&lt;ref name="OzComics"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://203.122.254.169:8080/amlibweb/lib/Subjects/English/Comic%20Book%20File/Comic%20Book%20Webs/History%204/HISTORY4.html|title=Australian comics|last=Maher|first=D|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often collaborated with his brother, Reginald Pitt.

==Biography==
Stanley Pitt was born in [[Rozelle, New South Wales]] (an inner western suburb of Sydney), on 2 March 1925,&lt;ref name="AusLit"/&gt; the son of plasterer George William Pitt and his wife Ethel.&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/obituaries/comic-book-ace-drew-on-allround-talent-20101114-17smu.html|title=Comic Book Ace drew on all round talent|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|last=Juddery|first=mark|date=15 November 2010|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt enjoyed drawing as a schoolboy and got into trouble for spending more time drawing than on his schoolwork.&lt;ref name="Bonzer"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bonzer – Australian comics 1900s–1990s|author1=Shiell, Annette (Editor)|publisher=Elgua Media|year=1998|place=[[Redhill, South Australia]]|page=125 |isbn=1-876308-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, whilst working as a [[milkman]] he had his first professional work, ''Anthony Fury'', published by [[Australian Consolidated Press]].&lt;ref name="OzComics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonzer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Panel By Panel: an Illustrated History of Australian Comics|author=John Ryan|publisher=Cassell Australia Ltd|year=1979|isbn=0-7269-7376-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://your.slv.vic.gov.au/treasures/index.php/contribution/18/1/122|title=Anthony Fury – Comic Book|publisher=[[State Library of Victoria]]|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt was heavily influenced by the classic style of [[Alex Raymond]]'s artwork the creator of [[Flash Gordon]],&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wheelahan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.readersvoice.com/interviews/2005/10/paul-wheelahan-talks-about-writing-more-than-800-westerns-page-2/|title=Paul Wheelahan talks about writing more than 800 westerns |last=Sandall|first=Simon|date=9 October 2005|publisher=readersvoice.com|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly his method of switching from a pen to a brush. The following year he began illustrating comics, written by Frank Ashley, for [[Frank Johnson Publications]]. These included ''Larry Flynn, Detective''. Pitt had no art training and no opportunity to associate with other Johnson artists, like [[Unk White]], Carl Lyon and [[Jim Russell (cartoonist)|Jim Russell]].&lt;ref name="Bonzer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DAAO"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daao.org.au/bio/stanley-john-pitt/#artist_biography|title=Stanley John Pitt – Biography|publisher=Design &amp; Art Australia Online|last=Kerr|first=Joan|year=1996|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945 he produced comic strip advertisements for [[Colgate Palmolive]], which led to Associated Newspapers placing him under contract to develop a new science fiction strip,&lt;ref name="Bonzer"/&gt; ''Silver Starr''&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt; (or ''Silver Starr in the Flameworld''). ''Silver Starr'' debuted in the Sydney newspapers ''The Guardian'' and ''[[The Sun (Australia)|Sunday Sun]]'' on 24 November 1946. The strips ran until November 1948, where following a dispute regarding the print size of the strip Pitt left the paper.&lt;ref name="Bonzer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DAAO"/&gt; ''Silver Starr'' was a [[Flash Gordon]]-style comic strip centred on an Australian soldier, Silver, who on his return from the [[World War II|Second World War]], joins an expedition, with his companions, Dr. Onro and Dyson, to the Earth's interior aboard a rocket-style ship. Together, they discover the incredible "Flame World" and its ruler, Queen Pristine (Pitt's compliment to Raymond's [[Dale Arden]]), rescuing her from the [[evil]] [[despotism|despot]], Tarka (another acknowledgement to Raymond's character [[Ming the Merciless]]). John Ryan, in his Australian comic anthology ''Panel by Panel'', describes the strip as having story lines of average standard for this type of comic with the real attraction being the artwork.&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt;{{Quote|Under Pitt's deft handling, the scenes of rock formations and underground caverns came to life; as did the seas of molten lava and the ship winding its way through rock and water.|John Ryan&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt;}}

In 1948 Pitt produced ''Jim Atlas'' and ''Dr Peril of Igogo'' as back-up stories for the early issues of ''[[Captain Atom (Atlas Publications)|Captain Atom]]'', a superhero comic by [[Arthur Mather]] published by [[Atlas Publications]].&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ausreprints.com/content/articles/?apg=713|title=Atlas|publisher=Gallery of Australian Reprint Comics|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pulpfaction.net/arthur_mather_0205|title=Arthur Mather: Man of the Atom|publisher=Pulp Faction|last=Patrick|first=Kevin|accessdate=14 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225071834/http://pulpfaction.net/arthur_mather_0205|archivedate=25 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitt was then employed by [[Fairfax Media|John Fairfax and Sons]] for their new paper, ''[[The Sun-Herald]]'', where he produced a new science fiction comic strip, ''Captain Power'', with the storyline provided by journalist Gerry Brown,&lt;ref name="Bonzer"/&gt; the first issue appearing on 6 March 1949.&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt; ''Captain Power'' relied heavily on super-hero style costumes and gadgets for its impact. He continued to illustrate the strip until June 1950, when the pressure of other work saw him pass the strip onto Peter James. At the time Pitt commenced illustrating ''Yarmak-Jungle King'' comics, for Young's Merchandising,&lt;ref name="Bonzer"/&gt; in November 1949, which he continued until June 1952.&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Terror"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://terrororstralis.com/terror.htm|title=Terror What?|publisher= |last=Wickham|first=Paul|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yarmak'' was a ''[[Tarzan]]'' imitation, with the comic illustrated by Pitt and inked at various stages by Frank and Jimmy Ashley and Paul Wheelahan, with the stories written by Frank Ashley or Pitt's younger brother, Reginald.&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Terror"/&gt; The quality of the comic varied from issue to issue given the number of people involved in its production. Together with his brother, Reginald, he attempted to get two strips, ''Lemmy Caution'' and ''Mr Midnight'', syndicated in the United States,&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt; when this failed he joined Cleveland Press in 1956, where he created a new series of ''Silver Starr''.&lt;ref name="Bonzer"/&gt; During his time at Cleveland Press, Pitt produced over 3,000 [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.warrigalpress.com.au/news.pdf|title=Stan Pitt : Australia's greatest ever Western cover artist|publisher=Warrigal Press|work=Newsletter June 2006 #1|last=Cooper|first=Joe|year=2006|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pulp: A Collector's book of Australian Pulp Fiction Covers|last=Johnson-Woods|first=Toni|year=2004|isbn= 978-0-642-10766-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two brothers then commenced work on a new comic, ''Gully Foyle''. ''Gully Foyle'' was conceived by Reginald, based on [[Alfred Bester]]'s novel ''[[The Stars My Destination]]''.&lt;ref name="Gully Foyle"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pulpfaction.net/gully_foyle|title=Gully Foyle: The Best Science Fiction Comic You'll Never Read|publisher=Pulp Faction|last=Patrick|first=Kevin|year=2007|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|The book made an indelible impression on me for so many years, even though it would be 10 years before we finally got the chance to do it.|Reginald Pitt&lt;ref name="Gully Foyle"/&gt;}} According to writer Kevin Patrick, Stan and Reginald's process involved producing black and white [[Bromide paper|bromide]] photo prints that Stan then coloured by hand; these were then forwarded to Bester in the United States for approval.&lt;ref name="Gully Foyle"/&gt; According to Patrick, the brothers completed several months of the comic strip for potential syndication but then faced a legal objection from the producers of a proposed film version of ''The Stars My Destination'', who held exclusive adaptation rights to the book.&lt;ref name="Gully Foyle"/&gt; Unable to sell ''Gully Foyle'', the brothers stopped work on the project, with only a few pieces of their artwork eventually making it into the public domain, through a number of fan magazines.&lt;ref name="Gully Foyle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Founders of Comic Fandom: Profiles of 90 Publishers, Dealers, Collectors, Writers, Artists and Other Luminaries of the 1950s and 1960s|publisher=Mcfarland &amp; Co Inc|year=2007|last=Schelly|first=Bill|page=124|isbn=978-0-7864-4347-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his artwork on the unpublished ''Gully Foyle'', Pitt was approached by two US publishers to handle comic book work for them.&lt;ref name="Bonzer"/&gt; Pitt then became the first Australian artist to have original material published in an American comic book,&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt; with the publication of ''[[The Witching Hour (DC Comics)|The Witching Hour]]'' No. 14&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/75466/|title=''The Witching Hour'' #14|publisher=[[Grand Comics Database]]|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[National Periodical Publications]], Inc) and ''[[Boris Karloff]] – Tales of Mystery'' No. 33&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/24032/|title=''Boris Karloff – Tales of Mystery'' #33|publisher=[[Grand Comics Database]]|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Western Publishing]]).&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt;

In 1969 the US cartoonist, [[Al Williamson]], arranged for Pitt to ghost an eleven-week sequence of his daily strip, ''[[Secret Agent Corrigan]]'',&lt;ref name="Bonzer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/gamma/history/al-williamson-interview-conducted-by-steve-ringgenberg|title=Al Williamson interview|publisher=The Comics Journal|last=Ringgeberg|first=Steve|date=18 June 2010|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by a further four weeks in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicartfans.com/GalleryPiece.asp?Piece=230266&amp;GSub=35770|title=Pitt, Stanley – Secret Agent Corrigan 2 May 1972 |publisher=Comic Art Fans|last=Cuthbert|first=Ray|year=2007|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt also provided poster illustrations for his childhood hero, ''[[Flash Gordon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicartfans.com/galleryroom.asp?gsub=81148|title=Stanley Pitt|publisher=Comic Art Fans – Galleries &amp; Markeplace|last=Lim|first=Victor|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://comics.ha.com/common/auction/catalogprint.php?SaleNo=110062&amp;src=|title=Session 1|publisher=Heritage Auction Galleries|date=13 June 2010|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mydelineatedlife.blogspot.com/2010/03/yay.html|title=The Pictorial Arts|last=Buchanan|first=Thomas|date=21 March 2010|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 a limited edition of ''Gully Foyle'' was finally published and released.&lt;ref name="Gully Foyle"/&gt; Pitt died on 2 April 2002, at the age of 77.
