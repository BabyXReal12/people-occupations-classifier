'''Michael Craig Judge''' (born October 17, 1962)&lt;ref name=allmovie&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/213433/Mike-Judge/biography|title=Mike Judge profile|first=Lucia|last=Bozzola|publisher=All Movie Guide via ''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American actor, animator, writer, producer, director and musician. Judge is the creator of the television series ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' (1993–97, 2011), and co-creator of the television series ''[[King of the Hill]]'' (1997–2010), ''[[The Goode Family]]'' (2009), ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]'' (2014–present), and ''[[Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus]]'' (2017). He also wrote and directed the films ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America]]'' (1996), ''[[Office Space]]'' (1999), ''[[Idiocracy]]'' (2006) and ''[[Extract (film)|Extract]]'' (2009).

Raised in [[New Mexico]], Judge graduated from [[University of California, San Diego]],&lt;ref name="ucsdnews"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patringenaru|first1=Ioana|title=From Physics Degree to Hollywood Success|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/thisweek/2009/06/15_gradjudge.asp|website=This Week @ UCSD|publisher=UCSD University Communications|accessdate=August 16, 2017|ref=ucsdnews}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied physics.&lt;ref name="ucsdnews"/&gt; After becoming uninterested in his career in science, Judge began to focus on animation and creating short films, one of which was developed into the successful [[MTV]] series ''Beavis and Butt-Head'', which eventually spawned a 1996 feature film as well as the spin-off series ''[[Daria]]'' (in which Judge had no involvement).

In 1995, Judge and former ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' writer [[Greg Daniels]] developed ''King of the Hill'', which quickly became a hit with both critics and audiences. During the run of the show, Judge took some time off to write and direct ''Office Space'', ''Idiocracy'', and ''Extract''.

As ''King of the Hill'' was coming to an end, Judge created his third show titled ''[[The Goode Family]]'', which received mixed reviews and was cancelled after 13 episodes. After a four-year hiatus, he created his fourth show ''Silicon Valley'', which has received critical acclaim since its premiere.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Judge has won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] and two [[Annie Award]]s for ''King of the Hill'' and two [[Critics' Choice Television Award]]s and [[Satellite Awards]] for ''Silicon Valley''.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Early life and education==
Michael Craig Judge is the second of three children born to William James "Jim" Judge, an archeologist, and Margaret Yvonne (née Blue), a librarian. He was born in [[Guayaquil|Guayaquil, Ecuador]],&lt;ref name=allmovie/&gt;&lt;ref name=con&gt;Contemporary Authors Online (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; where his father worked for a nonprofit organization promoting agricultural development.

Judge was raised from age 7 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Judge attended [[St. Pius X High School (Albuquerque)|St. Pius X High School]] before graduating with a Bachelor of Science in [[physics]] in 1986 from the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= He's the Father of Beavis and Butt-head, Huh, Huh|publisher= Associated Press via the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=March 26, 1996|first=Chip|last=Brown|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-26/entertainment/ca-51537_1|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1990–1997: Early career and ''Beavis and Butt-Head''===
He graduated in 1986 from [[University of California, San Diego]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Silicon Valley]] to join Parallax Graphics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Silicon Valley' Asks: Is Your Startup Really Making The World Better?|url=http://www.wbur.org/npr/304150243/silicon-valley-asks-is-your-startup-really-making-the-world-better|date=April 17, 2014|accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[startup company|startup]] [[video card]] company with about 40 employees based in Santa Clara. Disliking the company's culture and his colleagues ("The people I met were like [[The Stepford Wives|Stepford Wives]]. They were true believers in something, and I don't know what it was"), Judge quit after less than three months and became a [[bass player]] with a touring [[blues]] band.&lt;ref name="scott201404"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mike Judge Does Silicon Valley|work=Wired|date=2014|accessdate=March 30, 2014|author=Scott, Zachary|pages=88–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a part of [[Anson Funderburgh]]'s band for two years, playing on their 1990 [[Black Top Records]] release "Rack 'Em Up",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmansbluesreport.com/2011/12/what-does-anson-funderburgh-have-to-do.html |title=Bman's Blues Report: What does Anson Funderburgh have to do with Beavis and Butt-Head |publisher=Bmans blues report |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=November 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while taking graduate math classes at the [[University of Texas at Dallas]].{{r|scott201404}}  In 1989, after seeing animation cels on display in a movie theater, Judge purchased a [[Bolex]] [[16 mm film]] camera and began creating his own animated shorts. In 1991, his short film "Office Space" (also known as the ''[[Milton (cartoon)|Milton]]'' series of shorts) was acquired by [[Comedy Central]],{{r|scott201404}} following an [[List of international animation festivals|animation festival]] in Dallas. In the early 1990s, he was playing blues bass with [[Doyle Bramhall]].&lt;ref name="austinchronicle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2003-02-21/146068/|title=Life by the Drop: Doyle Bramhall returns to Fitchburg Street - Music|website=The Austin Chronicle|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, he developed ''[[Frog Baseball]]'',{{r|scott201404}} a short film featuring the characters [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]], to be featured on ''[[Liquid Television]]'', a 1990s animation showcase that appeared on [[MTV]]. The short led to the creation of the ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' series on MTV, in which Judge voiced both title characters as well as the majority of supporting characters and wrote and directed the majority of the episodes. The show centers on two socially incompetent, [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]-loving teenage wannabe delinquents, [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]], who live in the fictional town of Highland, Texas. The two have no adult supervision, are dim-witted, sex-obsessed, uneducated, barely literate, and lack any empathy or moral scruples, even regarding each other. Over its run, ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reaction from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TELEVISION; Keeping Beavis and Butt-Head Just Stupid Enough|work=New York Times|date=October 17, 1993|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/17/arts/television-keeping-beavis-and-butt-head-just-stupid-enough.html?scp=4&amp;sq=Beavis%20and%20Butt-Head&amp;st=cse|accessdate=September 6, 2017|first=Elizabeth|last=Kolbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of earlier episodes, in particular the first two – ''Blood Drive''/''Give Blood'' and ''Door to Door'' – which he described as "awful, I don't know why anybody liked it... I was burying my head in the sand."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Taint of Greatness: The Story of Beavis and Butt-Head Part 1", in ''The Mike Judge Collection'' Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The series spawned the feature-length film ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America]]'' and the spin-off show ''[[Daria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Road Trip the Right Vehicle for Beavis and Butt-head|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 20, 1996|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-20/entertainment/ca-10832_1_mike-judge|accessdate=November 8, 2010|first=Kevin|last=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beavis and Butt-head's Feminine Side|work=The New York Times|date=May 11, 1998|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/11/business/beavis-and-butt-head-s-feminine-side.html?scp=2&amp;sq=Beavis%20and%20Butt-head&amp;st=cse|accessdate=September 6, 2017|first=Alex|last=Kuczynski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two decades, the series aired its new season on October 27, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/they_re_back_PZVN8lcKHQYVIYx3xAJRtM|work=New York Post|title=They're back!|first=Michael|last=Starr|date=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere was dubbed a ratings hit, with an audience of 3.3&amp;nbsp;million total viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Post|title='Beavis and Butt-Head' revival a ratings hit|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/beavis_and_butt_head_revival_ratings_rkh7KbcRacynfcvurR04oJ|date=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 10, 2014, Judge announced that there is still a chance to pitch ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' to another network and that he wouldn't mind making more episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike Judge: 'Beavis and Butt-Head' Trapped in Limbo|url=http://www.craveonline.com/tv/articles/628453-mike-judge-says-beavis-and-butt-head-are-trapped-in-limbo|publisher=CraveOnline|accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1997–2009: ''King of the Hill'', ''Office Space'', and ''Idiocracy''===
In early 1995, after the successful first run of ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' on MTV, Mike Judge co-created the show ''[[King of the Hill]]'' with former ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' writer [[Greg Daniels]].&lt;ref name="kotharchives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewittliffcollections.txstate.edu/research/a-z/dauterive.html|title=The Wittliff Collections: King of the Hill|accessdate=February 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge was a former resident of [[Garland, Texas]], upon which the fictional community of Arlen was loosely based, but as Judge stated in a later interview, the show was based more specifically on the Dallas suburb [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]].&lt;ref name="productionhistory"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002501636|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008120722/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002501636|archivedate=October 8, 2007|title=Milestone: 'King of the Hill'|work=hollywoodreporter.com|date=May 11, 2006|accessdate=March 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shattuck|first=Kathryn|title=It Was Good to Be 'King,' but What Now?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/arts/television/26shat.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 29, 2011|date=April 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Judge conceived the idea for the show, drew the main characters, and wrote a pilot script. Judge voiced characters [[Hank Hill]] and [[Boomhauer]]. The show centers on the Hills, a middle-class Methodist family in the small suburban town of Arlen, Texas. It attempts to retain a naturalistic approach, seeking humor in the conventional and mundane aspects of everyday life while dealing with issues comically. After its debut in 1997, the series became a large success for Fox and was named one of the best television series of the year by various publications, including ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and ''[[TV Guide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207339,00.html|title=The New Classics: TV|date=June 17, 2007|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1997–98 season, the series became one of Fox's highest-rated programs and even briefly outperformed ''The Simpsons'' in ratings.&lt;ref name="9798-ratings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1997.htm|title=TV Ratings: 1997–1998|work=classictvhits.com|accessdate=April 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ratings remained consistent through the 10th through 12th seasons and had begun to rise in the overall [[Nielsen ratings]] (up to the 105th most watched series on television, from 118 in season 8), Fox abruptly announced in 2008 that ''King of the Hill'' had been cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shakefire.com/news/2008/11/01/reign-ends-for-king-of-the-hill|title=Reign ends for 'King of the Hill', Replaced By 'Family Guy' Spin-Off|publisher=CNN|date=November 1, 2008|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 30, 2009, it was announced that Fox ordered at least two more episodes to give the show a proper finale.&lt;ref name="futon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=8068|title=King of the Hill Originals still on Tap for next Season|date=April 30, 2009|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=April 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's 14th season was supposed to air sometime in the [[2009–10 United States network television schedule|2009–2010 season]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/king-of-the-hill/|title=King of the Hill on Fox|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Fox later announced that it would not air the episodes, opting instead for syndication.&lt;ref name="ricemeetspress"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2009/scene/news/rice-meets-the-press-1118006969/|title=Rice meets the press|first=Michael|last=Schneider|date=August 6, 2009|work=Variety|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 2009, however, Fox released a statement that the network would air a one-hour [[series finale]] (which consisted of a regular 30-minute episode followed by a 30-minute finale) on September 13, 2009.&lt;ref name="seriesfinale13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20090810fox01|title="King of the Hill" Serves Up Texas-size [sic] Series Finale Sunday, September 13, on Fox|date=August 10, 2009|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the panel discussion for the return of ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' at Comic-Con 2011, Mike Judge said that no current plans exist to revive ''King of the Hill'', although he would not rule out the possibility of it returning.&lt;ref name="cinemablend"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Comic-Con-2011-Beavis-Butt-Head-Back-Funnier-Than-Ever-33659.html|title=Comic-Con 2011: Beavis And Butt-Head Are Back And Funnier Than Ever|date=July 21, 2011|publisher=Television Blend|accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge began to develop one of his four animated short films entitled ''[[Milton (cartoon)|Milton]]'', about an office drone named Milton that Judge created, which first aired on ''[[Liquid Television]]'' and ''[[Night After Night with Allan Havey]]'', and later aired on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name="fierman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Fierman | first = Daniel | author2 = | title = Judge's Dread | work = Entertainment Weekly | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = February 26, 1999 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274497,00.html | accessdate = August 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration came from a temp job he once had that involved alphabetizing purchase orders&lt;ref name="beale"&gt;{{cite news | last = Beale | first = Lewis |authorlink=Lewis Beale| title = Mr. Beavis Goes to Work | work = [[New York Daily News]] | page = | publisher = | date = February 21, 1999 | url =http://www.nydailynews.com/mr-beavis-work-irreverent-animator-s-newest-target-corporate-america-live-action-film-office-space-article-1.839280 | accessdate =May 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a job he had as an engineer for three months in the Bay Area during the 1980s, "just in the heart of [[Silicon Valley]] and in the middle of that overachiever [[yuppie]] thing, it was just awful".&lt;ref name="sherman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sherman | first = Paul | author2 = | title = Humorist is a good Judge of office angst | work = [[Boston Herald]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = February 21, 1999 | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge sold the completed film [[Office Space]] to [[20th Century Fox]] based on his script and a cast that included [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Ron Livingston]], and [[David Herman]].&lt;ref name="fierman"/&gt; Originally, the studio wanted to make a film out of the Milton character but Judge was not interested, opting instead to make more of an [[ensemble cast]]–based film.&lt;ref name="sherman"/&gt; The studio suggested he make a movie like ''[[Car Wash (film)|Car Wash]]'' but "just set in an office".&lt;ref name="sherman"/&gt; Judge made the relatively painless transition from animation to live-action with the help of the film's director of photography who taught him about lenses and where to put the camera. Judge says, "I had a great crew, and it's good going into it not pretending you're an expert."&lt;ref name="beale"/&gt; Studio executives were not happy with the footage Judge was getting. He remembers them telling him, "More energy! More energy! We gotta reshoot it! You're failing! You're failing!"&lt;ref name="Valby"&gt;{{cite news|last=Valby|first=Karen|title=The Fax of Life|work=Entertainment Weekly|page=41|date=May 23, 2003|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,452194,00.html|accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Fox did not like the [[gangsta rap]] music used in the film until a focus group approved of it. Judge hated the ending and felt that a complete rewrite of the third act was necessary.&lt;ref name="Valby"/&gt; In the film, he made a [[cameo appearance]] as Stan (complete with [[Toupée|hairpiece]] and fake mustache), the manager of Chotchkie's, a fictionalized parody of [[Restaurant chain|chain restaurants]] like [[Chili's]], [[Applebee's]] and [[TGI Friday's]], and the boss of [[Jennifer Aniston]]'s character, whom he continually undermines and interrogates over her lack of sufficient enthusiasm for the job and the insufficient quantity of "flair" (buttons, ribbons, etc) she wears on her uniform. The film premiered on February 19, 1999, and was well received by critics. Although not particularly successful at the box office, it sold well on [[VHS]] and DVD, and it has come to be recognized as a [[Cult film|cult classic]].&lt;ref name="Doty"&gt;{{cite news|last=Doty|first=Meriah|title=Film flops flourish on DVD, VHS|work=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/04/second.wind/index.html|date=March 4, 2003|accessdate=September 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since fall 2003, Judge and fellow animator [[Don Hertzfeldt]] have run an animation festival, "[[The Animation Show]]". "The Animation Show" tours the country every year, screening animated shorts.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In 2005, Judge was presented with the [[Austin Film Festival]]'s Outstanding Television Writer Award by [[Johnny Hardwick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connell|first1=Joe|title=At the Austin Film Festival: Harold Ramis and Mike Judge receive awards|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2005-10-28/303832/|accessdate=January 20, 2018|work=The Austin Chronicle|date=October 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge has made supporting and cameo appearances in numerous films, Judge had a voice cameo in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut]]'' (1999), for the feature-length film adaptation of the popular [[Comedy Central]] series; he voiced [[Kenny McCormick]] when he was unhooded towards the end of the film. The science-fiction family comedy franchise ''[[Spy Kids (franchise)|Spy Kids]]'', where he played Donnagon Giggles in the first three films. His next film appearance would then be ''[[Serving Sara]]'' (2002) where he played a motel manager. He would later then appear in the comedy ''[[Jackass Number Two]]'' (2006), in which he can be seen during the closing credits. An extended version can be seen in ''[[Jackass 2.5]]'' (2007) which was a [[direct-to-video]] release. Judge also created a [[video clip]] of Beavis and Butt-Head ripping into [[Steve-O]] for his video ''Poke the Puss'', where the two try imagining if they would like the video better if they were [[Black people|black]]. The clip aired as a part of ''[[Jackassworld.com: 24 Hour Takeover|Jackassworld.com: 24-Hour Takeover]]'', a February 23, 2008, television special on MTV to coincide with the official launch of jackassworld.com. The characters appeared again in the third Jackass film, titled ''[[Jackass 3D]]'', at the beginning of the film, telling viewers to put on their 3D glasses for the film.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Judge's third film, ''[[Idiocracy]]'', a [[dystopia]]n comedy starring [[Luke Wilson]] and [[Maya Rudolph]], was given a [[limited release]] theatrically by [[20th Century Fox]] in September 2006, two years after production. The film original release date was August 5, 2005, according to Mike Judge.&lt;ref name="Dark"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike Judge Still Not In "3001"|work=Dark Horizons |date=February 28, 2005|first=Garth|last=Franklin|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news05/050228g.php|archive-url=https://archive.is/20080205220006/http://www.darkhorizons.com/news05/050228g.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 5, 2008|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, a release date was set for September 1, 2006. The film was released without a [[Film trailer|trailer]] or substantial marketing campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, John (September 8, 2006).

That speculation was followed by open criticism of the studio's lack of support from [[Ain't It Cool News]], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/24374|title=Open Letter to Fox re: IDIOCRACY!!!|publisher=Ain't It Cool News|first=Eric|last=Vespe|date=September 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1533437,00.html|title=Dude, Where's My Film?|work=Time Magazine|first=Joel|last=Stein|date=September 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ0606MJUDGE_84|title=Mike Judge Is Getting Screwed (Again)|work=Esquire|first=Brian|last=Raftery|date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time''{{'}}s Joel Stein wrote "the film's ads and trailers tested atrociously", but "still, abandoning ''Idiocracy'' seems particularly unjust, since Judge has made a lot of money for Fox."&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt; Despite the film not being screened for critics, the film received positive reviews and was a minor box office success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/idiocracy|title=Idiocracy|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the film was released to DVD in January 2007 and later aired on [[Pay television|premium-television]], [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplex]] channels: [[Cinemax]] in September 2007 and [[HBO]] in January 2008. Since then, it has gained a [[cult following]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Rob|title=This Joke's for You|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/magazine/04wwln-consumed-t.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 4, 2008|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009–2013: ''The Goode Family'', ''Extract'', and other projects===
Judge's fourth directorial effort was 2009's ''[[Extract (film)|Extract]]''. Shortly after completing ''Office Space'', Judge was already about 40 pages into his follow-up script, set in the world of an extract factory, when he was convinced by his representative team that he needed to shelve that and concentrate on something more commercial. "The only idea that I had that anyone was interested in was what eventually became ''Idiocracy''," says Judge. Over the next several years he focused his energy on developing ''Idiocracy''. But years later, by the time of the film's release, audiences had decided that ''Office Space'' had struck a chord, so they were ready to see Judge return to on-the-job humor, and thus the ''Extract'' script was given new life.&lt;ref name="Nasson, Tim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/behind_the_scenes/Extract-BEHINDTHESCENES.php|title=Extract-Behind the Scenes|work=wildaboutmovies.com|author=Nasson, Tim|date=August 13, 2009|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking to keep ''Extract'' below the radar of the studio system, Judge and his producers set up a production company, Ternion Productions, and arranged private financing—while partnering with Miramax for domestic distribution of the film. Judge relied heavily on his own personal knowledge of the industrial world to bring the story to life. "I actually worked in a factory a little bit myself ... I hopefully write stuff that is recognizable as the archetypes of this world," Judge stated.&lt;ref name="Nasson, Tim" /&gt;

Keeping true to this baseline of reality, "Extract" was shot in a working factory, in this case a water bottling plant south of Los Angeles, in the City of [[Commerce, California|Commerce]].&lt;ref name="Nasson, Tim"/&gt; He makes an uncredited appearance as Jim, a union organizer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Staff writer]] (April 28, 2008).

Judge's third television  series, ''[[The Goode Family]]'', debuted on ABC but was cancelled after one season. Comedy Central first aired the series on January 4, 2010. However, the series was pulled off of the schedule shortly thereafter. It was confirmed on ''The Goode Family'' Facebook page that Comedy Central had picked up the reruns of the series,&lt;ref name="facebook1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/TheGoodeFamilyshow|title=Niet compatibele browser|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=May 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was to be evaluated for a chance of being renewed for a second season.&lt;ref&gt;Garvin, Glenn.

In 2010, reruns of ''The Goode Family'' aired Monday nights at 10&amp;nbsp;pm on [[Comedy Central]], beginning January 4. It departed the network's primetime schedule after four weeks, returning occasionally in low-trafficked timeslots.&lt;ref name="facebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/TheGoodeFamilyshow|website=facebook.com|title=Goode Family Facebook Page |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Judge directed the music video (animation by [[Chris Prynoski|Titmouse]]) for [[country music]] group [[Zac Brown Band]]'s "[[The Wind (Zac Brown Band song)|The Wind]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/videos/zac-brown-band/811109/the-wind.jhtml|title=Videos: Zac Brown Band: The Wind|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]|accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Judge collaborated with [[Seth MacFarlane]] on a mashup episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'', in which, complete with a ''Hill''-themed opening, Judge reprises his role as Hank Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Snierson|first=Dan|title='Family Guy' meets 'American Dad' meets...

===2014–present: ''Silicon Valley'' and ''Tales from the Tour Bus''===
Judge created his fourth show ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]'' with ''[[King of the Hill]]'' executive producers John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky. The HBO comedy is a [[Single-camera setup|single-camera]] live-action sitcom set in Northern California. One of its main themes is the idea that "the people most qualified to succeed are the least capable of handling success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gold|first=Jon|title=Mike Judge to write dang-old Silicon Valley comedy for HBO, man|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/121012-judge-silicon-valley-264961.html|work=Network World|accessdate=February 26, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730163902/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/121012-judge-silicon-valley-264961.html|archivedate=July 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first season of ''Silicon Valley'' was 8 episodes long, and received critical and public acclaim.

On January 12, 2017, ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' confirmed that [[Cinemax]] ordered 8 episodes of Judge's new animated series, ''[[Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus]]''.

==Political views==
Despite his ''[[King of the Hill]]'' protagonist [[Hank Hill]] being identifiable as a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]]&lt;ref name=hank&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/707/707158p4.html|title=Interview: Mike Judge Reaches the Top of the Hill|author=Eric Goldman}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his ''[[The Goode Family]]'' being essentially a satire of many [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] viewpoints, Judge avoids discussing his political leanings. ''The Goode Family'' has been described as a [[Media bias in the United States#Conservative bias|conservative show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exurbanleague.com/Home/tabid/40/EntryId/347/The-Top-25-Conservative-TV-Shows-of-the-last-25-Years.aspx|title=The Top 25 Conservative TV Shows of the last 25 Years|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605031541/http://exurbanleague.com/Home/tabid/40/EntryId/347/The-Top-25-Conservative-TV-Shows-of-the-last-25-Years.aspx|archivedate=June 5, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing ''[[Idiocracy]]'', [[Salon.com|Salon]] stated, "Judge's gimlet eye is so ruthless that at times his politics seem to border on [[South Park Republican|''South Park'' libertarianism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevens |first=Dana |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2157486 |title=Mike Judge's Idiocracy reviewed. – By Dana Stevens – Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=January 12, 2007 |accessdate=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer for the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|libertarian]] magazine ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' seems to agree, comparing ''King of the Hill'' to the anti-authoritarian point of view of ''South Park'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'', though he calls the show more [[Populism|populist]], noting the disdain ''King of the Hill'' seems to have for bureaucrats, professionals, and [[Big-box store|big-box chains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Jesse Walker]] |url=http://reason.com/archives/2003/12/14/animated-discourse |title=Animated Discourse|publisher=Reason.com |date=December 14, 2003 |accessdate=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, Judge denies having political messages in his shows, saying in an [[IGN]] interview about ''King of the Hill'':&lt;ref name=hank/&gt;

{{quote|I try to not let the show get too political. To me, it's more social than political I guess you'd say, because that's funnier. I don't really like political reference humor that much. Although I liked the episode "Hank's Bully" where Hank's talking to the mailman and he says, 'Why would anyone want to lick a stamp that has [[Bill Clinton]] on it?' To me that's just like more of a character thing about Hank than it is a political joke or anything. I don't want to do a bunch of stuff about the [[Iraq War|war]], particularly.}}

In June 2016, before the [[United States presidential election, 2016|presidential election]] in November, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' published an article stating that Judge would produce ''Idiocracy''-themed [[Campaign advertising|campaign advertisements]] opposing [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's presidential campaign]] if given permission from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/idiocracy-team-ready-anti-donald-trump-campaign-ads-20160603|title='Idiocracy' Team Ready Anti-Donald Trump Campaign Ads|work=rollingstone.com|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later reported by ''[[Business Insider]]'' that the ads would not go forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/terry-crews-says-no-idiocracy-anti-donald-trump-ads-2016-7|title=Terry Crews says there won't be any 'Idiocracy'-themed ads attacking Donald Trump after all|work=businessinsider.com|accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
