He recalls that it was "a loud-, dumb-, pandering-, racist-, homophobic-type scene".<ref name= odenkirk>Odenkirk, Naomi.  (2002). Mr. Show What Happened?!

On August 18, 2018, Cross tweeted a photo of himself wearing sacred Latter Day Saint (Mormon) undergarments.  The tweet was meant to promote his show at Kingsbury Hall in Salt Lake City, Utah.  He faced criticism from LDS Church members who claim the photo was offensive to their religion and asked that the show be cancelled.  Ruth V. Watkins, President of the University of Utah where Kingsbury Hall is located released the following statement: “The University of Utah condemns bigotry and religious intolerance in any form. The offensive use of sacred religious imagery in a tweet by David Cross promoting his performance at Kingsbury Hall was in opposition to the university’s values of respect and inclusivity.  The use of the imagery was deeply offensive. At the same time, the First Amendment protects such speech, and the university cannot and will not censor content of those coming to campus. We acknowledge the free speech rights of individuals and entities who rent university facilities—even those with whom we disagree. By doing so, we protect the free speech rights of all.”

===Criticisms and feuds===

====Larry the Cable Guy====

Thats where we are as a nation now. Were in a state of vague American values and anti-intellectual pride."

In response, Larry devoted a chapter in his book GIT-R-DONE to Cross and the "political correctness PC left-wing politics left", claiming that Cross had "screwed with my fans, it was time for me to say something". Larry claimed that Rolling Stone was baiting comedians to attack him, and they turned to Cross only after Lewis Black refused (as Larry and Lewis are good friends<ref>{{cite news last=Ullman first=Ethan title=Interview with comedian Lewis Black url=http://www.albanystudentpress.org/interview-with-comedian-lewis-black-1.1278668#.Ue81B23lfms accessdate=24 July 2013 newspaper=Albany Student Press date=24 March 2010 quote=And we totally dont agree on politics, but hes a friend of mine. deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203170028/http://www.albanystudentpress.org/interview-with-comedian-lewis-black-1.1278668#.Ue81B23lfms archivedate=3 February 2014 df=}}</ref>).

He pokes fun at Larrys comedy in Freak Show with a character called "Danny the Plumber Guy".

====James Lipton====
Cross has criticized Inside the Actors Studio host James Lipton on a Mr. Show sketch and in his stand-up performance The Pride Is Back, calling him "pretentious."<ref>Cross, David. The Pride Is Back, track: "James Lipton"</ref> Lipton, who thought that Crosss impression of him was not good-natured, would later appear alongside Cross in Arrested Development (TV series) Arrested Development, in the recurring role of Prison Warden Stefan Gentiles. During filming, Cross was impressed with Liptons acting and comedic ability, and the two became good friends.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.premiumhollywood.com/2007/05/24/a-couple-of-questions-withjames-lipton/  title= A Couple of Questions with…James Lipton  publisher=}}</ref> On one commentary track for season four of Mr. Show, Cross discussed the encounter, complimenting Lipton for his professionalism and performance, saying that he liked Lipton personally but still "didnt care for" Inside The Actors Studio.

====Alvin and the Chipmunks====
Responding to critics of his decision to appear in the critically panned, but commercially successful, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Cross noted that the film paid for a summer home,<ref name=netburn>{{cite news  last= Netburn  first= Deborah  url= http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/03/entertainment/et-webcross3  title=Comedian defends his kid-flick role newspaper=Los Angeles Times  date=3 January 2008}}</ref> and more than "all my other projects combined: book, TV show, the two pilots, Year One (film) Year One, yeah."<ref name=sicha>{{cite news  last= Sicha  first=Choire  url= http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-conversation14-2009jun14,0,4296916,full.story  title= Its full speed ahead for David Cross newspaper=Los Angeles Times  date=14 June 2009}}</ref> Although he has admitted to taking the role primarily for the money, he has said that he does not regret doing so or consider it to be "selling out" as he has nothing against entertainment designed for children to enjoy that does not send a bad message.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1pNO9OM2MA  title= Amplified: David Cross Defends Chipmunks  publisher=YouTube  date=2010-05-31  accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref> Cross reprised his Chipmunks role in the films two sequels, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel and Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked. In 2011, Cross said the third film was "the most unpleasant experience Ive ever had in my professional life."<ref name=Toro>{{cite journal  url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/david-cross-calls-chip-wrecked-the-most-unpleasant-experience-of-his-career#  title=David Cross Calls Chip-Wrecked The Most Unpleasant Experience Of His Career first=Gabe  last=Toro  publisher=Indiewire Indiewire.com date=December 14, 2011 accessdate=January 20, 2012}}</ref> He stated that this was due to clashes with one particular producer, clarifying later that it was not Janice Karman or Ross Bagdasarian, Jr.<ref name=Toro/><ref>{{cite web url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/01/12/chipwrecked-producer-responds title=Chipwrecked producer responds to David Cross statements and Facebook apology first= Aly  last=Semigran date=January 12, 2012  work=Entertainment Weekly archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110004645/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/01/12/chipwrecked-producer-responds/ archivedate=2013-11-10}}</ref>

====Scott Stapp====

Cross has been critical of several pop music acts in his standup comedy, notably Creed (band) Creed and its lead singer, Scott Stapp. On his 2004 album Its Not Funny, Cross referred to Creed as "the third-worst band in history”, and maligned the groups pop sensibilities for being too ubiquitous, suggesting that Stapp hung around "10th grade girls locker rooms" to find inspiration for his song lyrics.<ref>{{cite web  last= Riedel  first= David  url= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/david-cross-five-things-to-know-about-him/  title=David Cross: Five things to know about him publisher= CBS News  date=August 18, 2011}}</ref> Cross then relates an anecdote about Stapp being a last-minute replacement for another celebrity at a taping of Celebrity Poker Showdown in 2003. Cross became concerned that a confrontation would take place since he had "said the most awful shit about that guy [Stapp] on stage and in print."<ref>{{cite web url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ctTiP7GfSI  title= David Cross - Hidden Track (Scott Stapp)  publisher= YouTube}}</ref> Cross said that as the taping was preparing to commence, he approached Stapp and extended his hand, introducing himself, and that Stapp shook his hand and sarcastically intoned, "Thanks for the words”, to which Cross replied, "Well, you know..."<ref>{{cite web  last= Modell  first= Josh  url= http://www.avclub.com/article/david-cross-67239  title=David Cross  work= The A.V.
