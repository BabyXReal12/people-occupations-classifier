in Pasadena, California, the son of Evelyn Dorothy (née Conner), a housewife, and Victor Richard Friberg (later Freberg), a Baptist minister.  Freberg was a Christian and of Swedish and Irish descent.
Frebergs work reflected both his gentle sensitivity (despite his liberal use of biting satire and parody) and his refusal to accept alcohol and tobacco manufacturers as sponsors—an impediment to his radio career when he took over for Jack Benny on Columbia Broadcasting System CBS radio. As Freberg explained to Rusty Pipes:
{{quote After I replaced Jack Benny in 1957, they were unable to sell me with spot announcements in the show. That would mean that every three minutes Id have to drop a commercial in. So I said, "Forget it. I want to be sponsored by one person", like Benny was, by American Tobacco or State Farm Insurance, except that I wouldnt let them sell me to American Tobacco.  I refused to let them sell me to any cigarette company.

Frebergs first wife, Donna, died in 2000. He had two children from that marriage, Donna Jean and Donavan Freberg Donavan. He married Betty Hunter in 2001.

==Animation==
Freberg was employed as a voice actor in animation shortly after graduating from Alhambra High School (Alhambra, California) Alhambra High School. He began at Warner Brothers in 1944 by getting on a bus and asking the driver to let him off "in Hollywood".  As he describes in his autobiography, It Only Hurts When I Laugh, he got off the bus and found a sign that said "talent agency".  He walked in, and the agents there arranged for him to audition for Warner Brothers cartoons where he was promptly hired.
His first notable cartoon voice work was in a Warner Brothers cartoon called For Hes a Jolly Good Fala, which was recorded but never filmed (due to the death of Fala (dog) Falas owner, President Franklin D. Roosevelt),{{Citation needed date=April 2015}} followed by Roughly Squeaking (1946) as Bertie; and in 1947, he was heard in Its a Grand Old Nag (Charlie Horse), produced and directed by Bob Clampett for Republic Pictures;{{Citation needed date=April 2015}} Goofy Gophers The Goofy Gophers (Tosh), and One Meat Brawl (Grover Groundhog and Walter Winchell).  He often found himself paired with Mel Blanc while at Warner Bros., where the two men performed such pairs as the mice Hubie and Bertie and Spike the Bulldog and Chester the Terrier.
In 1950, he was the voice of Friz Frelengs "Dumb Dog" in "Foxy by Proxy", who meets up with a disguised Bugs Bunny wearing a fox suit. He was the voice of Pete Puma in the 1952 cartoon Rabbits Kin, in which he did an impression of an early Frank Fontaine characterization (which later became Fontaines "Crazy Guggenheim" character).{{Citation needed date=April 2015}}

Freberg is often credited with voicing the character of Junyer Bear in Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears (1944), but that was actor Kent Rogers.{{Citation needed date=April 2015}} After Rogers was killed during World War II, Freberg assumed the role of Junyer Bear in Chuck Jones Looney Tunes cartoon Whats Brewin, Bruin? (1948), featuring Chuck Jones Jones version of The Three Bears (Looney Tunes) The Three Bears. He also succeeded Rogers as the voice of Beaky Buzzard.

Freberg was heard in many Warner Brothers cartoons, but his only{{Citation needed date=April 2015}} screen credit on one was Three Little Bops (1957). His work as a voice actor for Walt Disney Animation Studios Walt Disney Productions included the role of Mr. Busy the Beaver in Lady and the Tramp (1955) and did voice work in Susie the Little Blue Coupe and Lambert the Sheepish Lion.

==Films==
Freberg was cast to sing the part of the Jabberwock in the song "Beware the Jabberwock" for Disneys Alice in Wonderland (1951 film) Alice in Wonderland, with the Rhythmaires and Daws Butler. Written by Don Raye and Gene de Paul, the song was a musical rendering of the poem "Jabberwocky" from Lewis Carrolls Through the Looking-Glass. The song was not included in the final film, but a demo recording was included in the 2004 and 2010 DVD releases of the movie.{{Citation needed date=April 2015}}

Freberg made his movie debut as an on-screen actor in the comedy Callaway Went Thataway (1951), a satirical spoof on the marketing of Western stars (apparently inspired by the TV success of Hopalong Cassidy{{Citation needed date=April 2015}}). Freberg costarred with Mala Powers in Geraldine (1953) as sobbing singer Billy Weber, enabling him to reprise his satire on vocalist Johnnie Ray (see below).{{Citation needed date=April 2015}}  In 1963s Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Freberg appeared in a non-speaking role as the Deputy Sheriff and acted as the voice of a dispatcher.

Contrary to popular belief George Lucas called upon Freberg, not Mel Blanc, to audition for the voice of the character C-3PO for the 1977 film Star Wars (film) Star Wars. After he and many others auditioned for the part, Freberg suggested that Lucas use mime actor Anthony Daniels voice.
==Capitol Records==
===Early releases===
Freberg began making satirical recordings for Capitol Records, beginning with the February 10, 1951, release of "John and Marsha", a soap opera parody that consisted of the title characters (both played by Freberg) doing nothing but repeating each others names (with intonations to match the moods).
Some radio stations refused to play "John &amp; Marsha," believing it to be an actual romantic conversation between two real people. In a 1954 follow-up, he used pedal steel guitarist Speedy West to satirize the 1953 Ferlin Husky country hit, "A Dear John Letter", as "A Dear John and Marsha Letter" (Capitol 2677).{{Citation needed date=April 2015}} A seasonal recording, "The Night Before Christmas"/"Nuttin for Christmas", made in 1955, still remains a cult classic.{{Citation needed date=April 2015}}

With Daws Butler and June Foray, Freberg produced his 1951 Dragnet (franchise) Dragnet parody, "St. George and the Dragonet", a #1 hit for four weeks in October 1953.
It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc.
Another hit to receive the Freberg treatment was Johnnie Rays weepy "Cry (Churchill Kohlman song) Cry", which Freberg rendered as "Try" ("You too can be unhappy … if you try"), exaggerating Rays histrionic vocal style.
Ray was furious until he realized the success of Frebergs 1952 parody was helping sales and airplay of his own record.
Freberg reported getting more angry feedback for this than from his other parodies.
