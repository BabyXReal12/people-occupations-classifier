==Controversies==

===BBC contract===
In April 2006, Ross, along with other BBC personalities, had details of his fees leaked to the tabloid press.<ref>Julia Day [https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1756028,00.html "Radio 2 stars salaries leaked",] The Guardian, 18 April 2006</ref> It was claimed at the time, by a then-unidentified BBC mole (espionage) mole, that Ross earned £530,000 (equivalent to £10,000 per show) per year for hosting his Radio 2 show.<ref>Owen Gibson [https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1776263,00.html "BBC unmasks mole who leaked salary details of its biggest stars",] The Guardian, 17 May 2006</ref> While refusing to comment specifically on the leak in line with BBC policy on the matter, Ross did hint during his radio show that the figure was exaggerated; in addition to this, any pay highlighted as being "his" would actually be split between himself and his producer/co-presenter on the show, Andy Davies.

===David Cameron interview===
In June 2006, when Conservative Party (UK) Conservative Party leader David Cameron appeared on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Ross began a line of questioning relating to Conservative ex-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, culminating in the question "Did you or did you not have a masturbation wank thinking of Margaret Thatcher?" Ross was defended by the BBC publicly, but repeat showings of the interview have been banned.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2251285,00.html BBC to ban repeats of Ross versus Cameron] The Times, 1 July 2006</ref>

==="1,000 journalists" comment===
On 5 December 2007, Ross joked at the British Comedy Awards that his salary meant that he was "apparently worth 1,000 BBC journalists". His quip came shortly after the BBC had announced plans for more than 2,000&nbsp;job cuts, and was condemned as "obscene" by the general secretary of the National Union of Journalists.<ref>Colin Crummy [http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=39651 "Jonathan Ross: Im worth 1,000 BBC journalists",] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208170152/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=39651  date=8 December 2008 }} Press Gazette, 6 December 2007</ref> Ross has denied this saying that he was commenting on a piece that was written in a newspaper about his salary being that of 1,000 journalists:

"You know where that came from? The newspapers. After the fee was announced, they said, The BBC says hes worth 1,000 journalists, so on the Comedy Awards I made a joke that began, Apparently Im worth 1,000 journalists according to the newspapers. Every time its quoted, is the word apparently ever used? Which does change the meaning somewhat."<ref name="Interview in The Guardian, 3 September 2011">{{cite news  url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/02/jonathan-ross-interview-simon-hattenstone   location=London   work=The Guardian   first=Simon   last=Hattenstone   title=Jonathan Ross: look whos talking – interview   date=2 September 2011}}</ref>

===Gwyneth Paltrow interview===
The BBC Trust ruled that Rosss interview with American actress Gwyneth Paltrow, broadcast on 2 May 2008, breached editorial guidelines. They ruled that bad language in an episode of Rosss pre-recorded BBC1 chat show, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, in which the presenter told Paltrow he "would fuck her", was "gratuitous and unnecessarily offensive". The trust said it disagreed with the judgement made by BBC management that the episode should be broadcast uncensored, adding that the comment was made in an "overly sexual way" and that it had upheld a number of complaints made about the edition of Friday Night with Jonathan Ross.<ref>{{cite web author=Tara Conlan at Broadcasting House and Leigh Holmwood  url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/21/russell-brand-jonathan-ross  title=BBC Trust criticises Jonathan Ross over lewd comment to Gwyneth Paltrow  publisher=Guardian  date=21 November 2008  accessdate=29 March 2014}}</ref> The trust reminded BBC staff that "the casual gratuitous use of the most offensive language is not acceptable on the BBC in accordance with the BBCs existing guidelines and practices", adding that "this particularly applies in entertainment programmes".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7742130.stm At a glance: BBC Trust report] BBC News, 21 November 2008</ref>

===The Russell Brand Show and Andrew Sachs===
{{Main The Russell Brand Show prank telephone calls row}}
Following a guest appearance by Ross on The Russell Brand Show (radio show) The Russell Brand Show broadcast on 18 October 2008, Ross was suspended for 12 weeks without pay by the BBC on 29 October, after a series of lewd answerphone messages, including Ross saying, "He fucked your granddaughter", were left for then 78-year-old actor Andrew Sachs regarding Sachs granddaughter Georgina Baillie, by Russell Brand and Ross, which were broadcast on the pre-recorded show.<ref name="suspended">{{cite news url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7696714.stm title= Brand and Ross suspended by BBC date=29 October 2008 publisher=BBC accessdate=29 October 2008}}</ref> After little initial interest, a media story about the calls by the Daily Mail generated a high number of complaints. Brand resigned from the BBC, while Ross was suspended without pay. BBC director general Mark Thompson (media executive) Mark Thompson stated that Ross should take the disciplinary action as a "final warning".<ref>{{cite news   title=The ups and downs of Ross career   date=30 October 2008  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7700656.stm   publisher =BBC News   accessdate =30 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news   title=Ross suspended for three months   date=30 October 2008   url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7700816.stm   publisher =BBC News    accessdate =30 October 2008}}</ref> The BBC was later fined £150,000 by Britains broadcast regulator for airing the calls.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/5099055/BBC-fined-150000-over-Brands-prank-calls.html title=BBC fined £150,000 over Brands prank calls  last=Khan first=Urmee date=3 April 2009 work=The Daily Telegraph accessdate=8 October 2009   location=London}}</ref>

On 21 November 2008, the BBC Trust said that the phone calls were a "deplorable intrusion with no editorial justification".<ref>{{cite news url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7741322.stm title= No justification for Brand show publisher= BBC date= 21 November 2008 accessdate=21 November 2008}}</ref> The trust gave its backing to Rosss 12-week suspension but recommended that no further action be taken against him. He returned to work in January 2009 with a new series of Friday Night. From 23 May 2009, Ross BBC Radio 2 show was recorded 24 hours before broadcast.<ref>{{cite web url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8063092.stm  title=Rosss radio show no longer live –  publisher=BBC News  date=22 May 2009  accessdate=29 March 2014}}</ref>

===Homophobia accusation===
On 13 May 2009, Ross was accused of homophobia after a comment he made on his radio show,<ref>Geen, Jessica. [http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-12406.html "Exclusive: Jonathan Ross accused of homophobia"], Pink News, 13 May 2009. Retrieved 14 May 2009</ref> in which he said,

<blockquote>
If your son asks for a Hannah Montana MP3 player, then you might want to already think about putting him down for LGBT adoption adoption in later life, when they settle down with their partner.<ref name=ofcom-07-09>[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb137/Issue137.pdf "Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin Issue 137"] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710234120/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb137/Issue137.pdf  date=10 July 2009 }}, Ofcom, 6 July 2009. Retrieved 6 July 2009</ref>
</blockquote>

An incorrect version of this quote was also circulated, in which Ross was accused of saying:

<blockquote>
If your son asks for a Hannah Montana MP3 player, you might want to already think about putting him down for child adoption adoption before he brings his … erm … partner home.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/17/jonathan-ross-gay-homophobia  title=Jonathan Rosss gay joke was wrong  publisher=Guardian  date=  accessdate=29 March 2014}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Ofcom received 61 complaints following the comment. On 7 July 2009, Ofcom ruled that Ross did not breach the broadcasting code. They wrote in their opinion that "the comment was clearly presented as a joke intended to make light of the reactions that some parents may have if their child chooses a toy that is very widely recognised to be designed and marketed for the opposite sex" and that the nature of the joke and tone and manner in which it was presented "made clear that it was not intended to be hostile or pejorative towards the gay community in general."<ref name=ofcom-07-09/> Stonewall (UK) Stonewall criticised the ruling; saying "the fact that a comment is light-hearted does not absolve it from perpetuating the stereotypes that lead to homophobic bullying."<ref>Geen, Jessica. [http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-13122.html "Stonewall: Rosss light-hearted comment still encourages bullying"], Pink News, 6 July 2009. Retrieved 6 July 2009</ref>
