==Career==

===Early work and Family Fortunes===
As a comedian Dennis worked the North West England North West social and working mens clubs. He was given his earliest opportunities by Liverpool-based husband and wife theatrical agents Stuart and Dorene Gillespie (who had themselves been a successful variety act) and whom Dennis in his autobiography credits with discovering him. His debut radio broadcast was in 1971 on Stuarts BBC Radio Merseyside series Variety Time (the programmes were taped in front of a live audience in Merseyside clubs). In 1974, he won New Faces, an ITV (TV network) ITV talent show and appeared on numerous light-entertainment shows. Dennis almost became the first contestant ever to score the maximum 120 points on New Faces; but had to settle for 119 when Tony Hatch gave him 9 out of 10 in his final mark, drawing derision from the rest of the panel that included Arthur Askey.

In 1982, he joined as one of the team on Russ Abbots Madhouse and The Russ Abbot Show before forming a comedy partnership with fellow impressionist Dustin Gee, which in turn led to a series of their own, The Laughter Show.

Aspel had arranged for the Family Fortunes buzzer to keep sounding at the end of the episode where Dennis usually says goodbye to the viewers, and to have the words "Les Dennis Tonight..." appear on the Family Fortunes big studio screen, much to the bewilderment of Dennis, who realised what was happening only when he turned around and saw Michael Aspel walking onto the set.
