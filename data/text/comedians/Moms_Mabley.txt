Her father owned and operated several successful businesses, while her mother kept house and took in boarders. While working as a volunteer fireman in 1909, her father died when a fire engine exploded. Loretta was 15 years old at the time.<ref>{{Cite web url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=104110166 title=James P.

==Career==
Loretta Aiken took her stage name, Jackie Mabley, from an early boyfriend, commenting to Ebony (magazine) Ebony in a 1970s interview that he had taken so much from her, it was the least she could do to take his name.<ref>{{cite news title=Moms Mabley: She Finally Makes the Movies work=Ebony (magazine) Ebony page=88 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LN4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA88 quote=But instead of making a name for Loretta Aiken during this time, Moms was taking a name from a man named Jack Mabley. Jack was my first boyfriend, Moms says... He took a lot off me and the least I could do was take his name. date=April 1974}}</ref> Later she became known as "Moms" because she was indeed a "Mom" to many other comedians on the circuit in the 1950s and 1960s.{{cn date=February 2018}}

She came out as a lesbian at the age of twenty-seven, becoming one of the first openly gay comedians.<ref>Keith Stern. Queers in History: The Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Historical, pg. 295.<!-- publisher, ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> During the 1920s and 1930s she appeared in androgynous clothing (as she did in the film version of The Emperor Jones (1933 film) The Emperor Jones with Paul Robeson) and recorded several of her early "lesbian stand-up" routines.{{cn date=February 2018}}

Mabley was one of the most successful entertainers of the Chitlin circuit, another name for Theatre Owners Booking Association T.O.B.A., or Theater Owners Booking Association. T.O.B.A., sometimes called the "Tough On Black Asses Circuit", was the segregated organization for which Mabley performed until the organization dissolved during the Great Depression. Despite Mableys popularity, wages for black women in show business were meager.<ref name=":0"/> Nonetheless, she persisted for more than sixty years. At the height of her career, she was earning US$10,000 a week at Harlems Apollo Theater. She made her New York City debut at Connies Inn in Harlem.<ref name=eb>{{cite web title=Moms Mabley url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-9399767 work=Encyclopædia Britannicas Guide to Black History publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. year=2009 accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> 

In the 1960s, she became known to a wider white audience, playing Carnegie Hall in 1962,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.sfgate.com/tv/article/Whoopi-Goldberg-Presents-Moms-Mabley-review-4986351.php title=Whoopi Goldberg Presents Moms Mabley review last=Wiegand first=David date=November 15, 2013 work=San Francisco Chronicle accessdate=September 8, 2014}}</ref> and making a number of mainstream TV appearances, particularly her multiple appearances on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour when that CBS show was number one on television in the late 1960s, which introduced her to a whole new Baby Boomer Boomer audience.<ref>[http://www.pics-celeb.com/2010/01/moms-mabley-loretta-mary-aiken-jackie.html Jackie Mabley], pics-celeb.com; retrieved 2010-10-30.</ref><ref>{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0726931 title="The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" Episode date=January 21, 1972 work=IMDb accessdate=February 19, 2018}}</ref> 

Mabley was billed as "The Funniest Woman in the World". She tackled topics too edgy for most mainstream comics of the time, including racism. One of her regular themes was a romantic interest in handsome young men rather than old "washed-up geezers", and she got away with it courtesy of her stage persona, where she appeared as a toothless, bedraggled woman in a house dress and floppy hat.<ref>{{cite news url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DD1F30F93AA3575BC0A961948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all title=The Pain Behind The Laughter of Moms Mabley author=Leslie Bennets work=The New York Times date=August 9, 1987 accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web author=Alden Reimonenq title=The Harlem Renaissance url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/harlem_renaissance.html work=glbtq Encyclopedia date=October 9, 2007 accessdate=2008-01-22 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102095452/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/harlem_renaissance.html archivedate=January 2, 2008}}</ref> 

She also added the occasional satirical song to her jokes, and her (completely serious and melancholy) cover version of "Abraham, Martin and John" hit #35 on the Billboard Hot 100 Billboard Hot 100 on July 19, 1969. At 75 years old, Mabley became the oldest living person ever to have a US Top 40 hit (Louis Armstrong, who would have been 86 when "What a Wonderful World" became a hit in 1988, is the oldest overall, although Armstrong was younger than Mabley when the record was made).{{cn date=February 2018}}

Mabley had six children: Bonnie, Christine, Charles, and Yvonne Ailey,<ref name=eb/><ref>{{cite news author=M.Cordell Thompson title=Moms Mabley Leaves $½ Million Estate url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA59&dq=Moms+Mabley&as_brr=1&ei=nqd4SdjcKoj-lQS76aQu work=Jet date=July 24, 1975 accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> and two given up for adoption when she was a teenager.<ref>{{cite book author= chapter=Moms Mabley Biography url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/mabley-moms-1897-1975-sjpc-03 title=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture publisher=Thomson Gale year=2009 accessdate=2009-02-16 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016090241/http://www.bookrags.com/biography/mabley-moms-1897-1975-sjpc-03 archivedate=2009-10-16}}</ref> She died from heart failure in White Plains, New York on May 23, 1975.<ref name=apobit>{{cite news title=Moms Mabley Dies at 77 url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mTRIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8gANAAAAIBAJ&pg=1019,3361364&dq=moms+mabley+died&hl=en newspaper=Associated Press date=May 23, 1975 accessdate=2013-11-18}}</ref> She is interred at Ferncliff Cemetery, Hartsdale, New York.
