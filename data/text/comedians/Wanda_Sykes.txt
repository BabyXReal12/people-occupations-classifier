==Early life==
Born in Portsmouth, Virginia,
Sykes family moved to Maryland when she was in third grade.
Her mother, Marion Louise (née Peoples), worked as a banker, and her father, Harry Ellsworth Sykes, was a Colonel (United States) U.S. Army colonel employed at the Pentagon.
Sykes family history was researched for an episode of the 2012 PBS genealogy program Finding Your Roots With Henry Louis Gates Jr. Her ancestry was traced back to a 1683 court case involving her paternal ninth great-grandmother Elizabeth Banks, a free white woman and indentured servant, who gave birth to a biracial child, Mary Banks, fathered by a slave, who inherited her mothers free status. According to historian Ira Berlin, a specialist in the history of American slavery, the Sykes family history is "the only such case that I know of in which it is possible to trace a black family rooted in freedom from the late 17th century to the present."
Sykes attended Arundel High School
in Gambrills, Maryland, and went on to graduate from Hampton University,
where she earned a bachelor of science degree in marketing
