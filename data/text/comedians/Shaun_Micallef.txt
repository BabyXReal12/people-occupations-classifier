===Early theatre===
In 1972, having three younger sisters taking ballet classes, ten-year-old Micallef was often asked to help out when a dance routine required a boy. The following year he auditioned for the Bunyip Childrens Theatre and over the next four years participated in plays that they performed in the Scott Theatre during school holidays. In 1976 he doubled for Humphrey B. Bear for personal appearances.<ref>{{cite web title=Spicks and Specks, Episode Twenty Three url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/spicksandspecks/txt/s2287764.htm publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation accessdate=9 February 2014 quote=He recently admitted on a raido that he played the popular childrens character Humphrey B. Bear for a period of three weeks during the 1970s.}}</ref>

===Legal career===
Micallef was a practising solicitor for ten years in the field of insurance law before making the decision to move to Melbourne and pursue a full-time career in comedy in 1993.<ref name="anything" />

He relates the story that, while working as a solicitor, he talked so much about making a career change and becoming a comedian that his wife Leandra gave him an ultimatum: she marked a date on a calendar and told him to quit his job and become a comedian by that date or never talk about it again.<ref>{{cite news last=Lallo first=Michael title=His current affair url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/btvb-micallef-rewrites-headlines-with-comedy-inewstopiai/2007/10/02/1191091106590.html?page=fullpage accessdate=9 February 2014 newspaper=The Age date=4 October 2007 quote=Fed up with his all-talk, no-action attitude, his wife Leandra issued an ultimatum. "She put an X on the calendar and said, You have to have done something about it by this date or you have to shut up."}}</ref>

===Television and film===
Following early TV appearances on Theatre Sports (1987) and The Big Gig (1989), in early 1993 Micallef was offered a job writing for the Jimeoin show which was soon followed by an offer to also write for the sketch comedy show Full Frontal (Australian TV series) Full Frontal where six months later he took on the role as co-producer with Gary McCaffrie. In 1994, Micallef became a full-time cast member of Full Frontal, where he became well known for characters such as Milo Kerrigan, Nobby Doldrums and a send-up of Italian male model Fabio Lanzoni Fabio.  Micallef recalls that the show was a good introduction to television comedy because, with an ensemble cast, its success did not hinge on his performance and he had more freedom to make and learn from mistakes.  However, he was frustrated with the lack of control he had over his work in the series as well as the repetition of characters and gags.<ref name="anything" />

Micallefs role on Full Frontal led to a 1996 special Shaun Micallefs World Around Him and three seasons of the two-time Logie Award-winning ABC Television ABC series The Micallef Program (1998–2001), which he co-wrote and produced with long-time writing partner Gary McCaffrie.<ref>{{cite web  author=Martin, Simon  url=http://www.shaunmicallef.com/articles/mercury.html  title=Shaun Micallef  work=The Mercury  date=October 2004  accessdate=20 August 2008  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106123822/http://www.shaunmicallef.com/articles/mercury.html  archivedate=6 January 2009  df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since the series end he has created and starred in two short-lived television series, the sitcom Welcher & Welcher (2003) and the variety show Micallef Tonight (2003),<ref name=record>{{cite web  author=Witham, Katrina  url=http://www.shaunmicallef.com/articles/couriermail.html  title=Micallef on the Record  work=The Courier Mail  date=9 September 2004  accessdate=20 August 2008  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106120309/http://www.shaunmicallef.com/articles/couriermail.html  archivedate=6 January 2009  df=dmy-all }}</ref> and devised a series of telemovies, BlackJack (telemovie) BlackJack (2003–present).<ref>{{cite web  author=Courtis, Brian   url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/grumpy-old-man/2005/09/08/1125772628702.html   title=Grumpy old man  work=The Age  date=11 September 2005   accessdate=20 August 2008}}</ref>
