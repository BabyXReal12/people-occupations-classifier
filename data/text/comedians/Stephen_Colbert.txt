Colberts work as a correspondent on Comedy Centrals news-parody series The Daily Show gained him wide recognition. In 2005, he left The Daily Show to host The Colbert Report.

==Early life==
Colbert was born in Washington, D.C.,
the youngest of 11 children in a Catholic family.
He spent his early years in Bethesda, Maryland.
He grew up on James Island (South Carolina) James Island, South Carolina. Colbert and his siblings, in descending order by age, are James III, Edward, Mary, William, Margo, Thomas, Jay, Elizabeth Colbert-Busch Elizabeth, Paul, Peter, and Stephen. His father, James William Colbert Jr., was an immunology immunologist and medical school dean at Yale University, Saint Louis University, and finally at the Medical University of South Carolina, where he served as vice president for academic affairs. Stephens mother, Lorna Elizabeth Colbert (née Tuck), was a homemaker.
In interviews, Colbert has described his parents as devout people who also strongly valued intellectualism and taught their children that it was possible to question the church and still be Catholic.
The emphasis his family placed on intelligence and his observation of negative stereotypes of Southerners led Colbert to train himself to suppress his Southern American English Southern accent while he was still quite young.

As a child, he observed that Southerners were often depicted as being less intelligent than other characters on scripted television; to avoid that stereotype, he taught himself to imitate General American the speech of American news presenter news anchors.
While Colbert sometimes comedically claims his surname is French, he is of 15/16ths Irish ancestry (one of his paternal great-great-grandmothers was of German and English descent).
Many of his ancestors emigrated from Ireland to North America in the 19th century before and during the Great Famine (Ireland) Great Famine.
Originally, his surname was pronounced {{IPAc-en ˈ k oʊ l b ər t}} {{respell KOHL bərt}} in English; Stephen Colberts father, James, wanted to pronounce the name {{IPAc-en k oʊ l ˈ b ɛər}} {{respell kohl BAIR }}, but maintained the {{IPA /ˈkoʊlbərt/}} pronunciation out of respect for his own father. He offered his children the option to pronounce the name whichever way they preferred.
Stephen started using {{IPA /koʊlˈbɛər/}} later in life when he transferred to Northwestern University, taking advantage of the opportunity to reinvent himself in a new place where no one knew him.
Stephens brother Edward, an intellectual property attorney, retained {{IPA /ˈkoʊlbərt/}}; this was shown in a February 12, 2009, appearance on The Colbert Report, when his youngest brother asked him, "{{IPA /ˈkoʊlbərt/}} or {{IPA /koʊlˈbɛər/}}?" Ed responded "{{IPA /ˈkoʊlbərt/}}", to which Stephen jokingly replied, "See you in Hell".
On September 11, 1974, when Colbert was ten years old, his father and two closest brothers (by age), Peter and Paul, died in the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 212 while it was attempting to land in Charlotte, North Carolina.
They were en route to enroll the two boys at Canterbury School (Connecticut) Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut.
