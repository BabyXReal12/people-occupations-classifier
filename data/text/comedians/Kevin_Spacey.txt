In 2007, Gotham (magazine) Gotham magazine quoted Spacey saying:<blockquote>Ive never believed in pimping my personal life out for publicity.

In October 2017, Spacey coming out came out as gay when he apologized to Anthony Rapp for a drunken sexual advance that he had allegedly made (but said he did not recall making) to the then 14-year-old Rapp in 1986; Spacey said, "I have had relationships with both men and women.
