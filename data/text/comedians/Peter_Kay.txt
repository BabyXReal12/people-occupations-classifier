Peter John Kay (born 2 July 1973) is an English comedian and actor. Kay has written, produced, and acted in several television and film projects, and authored three books. 

Born and brought up in Bolton, Lancashire to a family of Irish descent, Kay studied media performance at the University of Salford. He began working part-time as a stand-up comedian, winning the North West Comedian of the Year award. In 1997 he won Channel 4s So You Think Youre Funny contest and the following year was nominated for a Perrier Award for his show at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. With his public profile raised, in 2000 he co-wrote and starred in That Peter Kay Thing for Channel 4. This resulted in a spin-off sitcom, Phoenix Nights, which ran for two series from 2001 to 2002, and in turn generated another spin-off, Max and Paddys Road to Nowhere, in 2004. In 2005, he recorded a promotional video in which he mimed to Tony Christies 1971 hit "Is This the Way to Amarillo", which was re-released in aid of the Children In Need charity and credited to "Tony Christie featuring Peter Kay". The song reached number one in the UK Singles Chart. 

In 2008, he co-wrote and starred in Britains Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice, a parody of reality television shows. As the series fictional protagonist Geraldine McQueen, he released the single "The Winners Song", which reached number two in the singles chart. His 2010–11 stand-up comedy tour was officially inaugurated into the Guinness World Records as the most successful of all time,
playing to over 1.2 million people. He co-wrote and starred in Peter Kays Car Share, a sitcom screened by the BBC for two series between 2015 and 2017. He also starred in the 2015 BBC sitcom Cradle to Grave. In 2016, Kay won the British Academy Television Award for Best Male Comedy Performance BAFTA TV Award for Best Male Comedy Performance, the British Academy Television Award for Best Situation Comedy BAFTA TV Award for Best Scripted Comedy and the 21st National Television Awards National Television Award for Best Comedy for Car Share. He also received an honorary doctorate from the University of Salford.
==Early life==
{{BLP unsourced section date=September 2015}}
Peter John Kay was born and brought up in Municipal Borough of Farnworth Farnworth, Lancashire
, where he attended Mount Saint Joseph RC School, leaving with one GCSE in art. His father Michael was an engineer who passed away just before his career took off
, his mother, Deirdre ONeill, is a Roman Catholic from Coalisland, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland
and Peter was brought up in her faith. He took several minor jobs, including working in a toilet roll factory, a Netto (store) Netto supermarket, a cash and carry, a cinema, a petrol station and a bingo hall, which later inspired episodes for That Peter Kay Thing. 

He began a degree course at the University of Liverpool but dropped out because he was given an unconditional offer to attend a Higher National Diploma (HND) in media performance at the University of Salford. He then attended the University of Salfords school of media, music and performance, where he studied for an HND in Media Performance, which he completed; this involved a stand-up course.

His first stand-up was the competition the North West Comedian of the Year, which was held in Manchester and hosted by Dave Spikey, who would later be the co-star and co-writer of Phoenix Nights. Kay was last on the bill and won the competition, beating Johnny Vegas. Kay has said that he sought a career in comedy. However, Kay continued to work part-time as an usher at his local cinema in Bolton whilst performing stand-up locally. When the cinema closed, Kay was presented with the choice between finding another job or moving into comedy full-time.

After he entered and won Channel 4s So You Think Youre Funny? contest in 1997, his first semi-professional stand-up appearances were at the 1998 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, where he received a prestigious Perrier Award nomination. During this time, he also appeared at various other clubs, such as Londons The Comedy Store (London) Comedy Store. 

Although this led to a certain level of public recognition, it was only after his first live video show Live at the Top of the Tower in 2000 that Kay attained mainstream recognition. During this period, he appeared on several chat shows, such as Friday Night with Jonathan Ross and Parkinson (TV series) Parkinson, on the latter of which he had previously served as warm up. It was at this time that production also began on Phoenix Nights. Subsequent advertisements for John Smiths bitter which imitate the style of Phoenix Nights saw Kay develop his catchphrases "ave it!" and "two lamb bhunas".

In a nightclub in Bolton in 1998 Kay met Susan Gargan whilst Peter was working at the local cinema. They married in 2001 after being in a relationship for three years, they have remained very private about their children, they have a teenage son Charlie Michael Kay (that they named him after their fathers, with Charlie being the name of Susans late father) they are also thought to have two other children.
===1997–2000: Early career===
{{BLP unsourced section date=September 2015}}
Kays first TV project was in a 1997 episode of New Voices, a comedy series which showcased rising talent. His episode, "Two Minutes", written by Johanne McAndrew, saw him play a getaway driver as two of his friends attempted to rob a pub of its takings. After presenting a slot titled "Peter Kays World of Entertainment" on BBC2s The Sunday Show, Kay made an episode of Channel 4s Comedy Lab, "The Services", in 1998, which won a Royal Television Society award for best newcomer. This served as a pilot for That Peter Kay Thing. Following the series success, Kay and his co-writers – Neil Fitzmaurice and Dave Spikey – used the episode "In the Club" as the basis for Phoenix Nights, which was an immediate hit. Set in a newly refurbished social club run by Brian Potter, the first series was filmed in part at St Gregorys Social Club in Farnworth, Greater Manchester, where the exterior, hallways and function suite were used.

In 2004, Kay followed the success with Max and Paddys Road to Nowhere, a spin-off of Phoenix Nights. The show featured the bouncer characters from the show – played by Kay and Paddy McGuinness – and at times also featured other characters from Phoenix Nights. Six episodes were made and broadcast from November to December 2004 by Channel 4. In 2005, Kay was awarded a Rose dOr at the international television festival in Montreux for Best Performance by an Actor.

On 17 April 2006, Channel 4 broadcast a "Peter Kay Night", showing out-takes from Phoenix Nights (previously featured on DVD), a behind-the-scenes documentary "180 – A Tour Documentary" which followed Kay behind the scenes of his Mum Wants a Bungalow tour and screened the whole Peter Kay Live in Manchester Arena show. In 2008, he returned to television after an absence of four years with the BAFTA-winning satire of reality talent shows, Peter Kays Britains Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice, which he co-wrote with Paul Coleman. The two-hour special was screened on Channel 4 on 17 October 2008. Kay won his second Royal Television Society award for best actor for playing Geraldine McQueen, a transsexual dinner lady from Ireland.

===2000–2011: Stage shows===
Kay has released several DVDs of live performances, including Live at the Top of the Tower, Live at the Bolton Albert Halls (which holds the record as biggest selling British stand-up DVD), Peter Kay: The Live Collections (the previous two combined), Peter Kay: Live at Manchester Arena, and Peter Kay Live – The Tour That Didnt Tour Tour (which was recorded during his fifteen-night sold-out run at The O2 Arena in London).{{citation needed date=September 2015}}

===BBC work===
{{BLP unsourced section date=September 2015}}
In 2007, Kay followed this success with a cover version of "Im Gonna Be (500 Miles)", originally by the Proclaimers, for Comic Relief. The video featured a celebration of British talent. In 2009, Kay switched his musical fund-raising to Children in Need with the release of Peter Kays All Star Animated Band, which had taken two years to complete. He brought together over 100 animated childrens characters in a six-minute animated medley. These characters included Thomas the Tank Engine, Bob the Builder and Paddington Bear. It also featured some of the characters original voice artists including Bernard Cribbins, Neil Morrissey, Ken Barrie and Ringo Starr. The video was premiered on BBC1 on 20 November 2009.

Kay returned his support to Comic Relief in 2011 with a cover version of "I Know Him So Well". The song was re-recorded by multi-platinum selling singer Susan Boyle and Kay in the guise of Geraldine McQueen from Britains Got the Pop Factor. The video which accompanied the single was also directed by Kay and identically parodied the original video shot for shot. It premiered on Comic Relief on Friday, 18 March 2011.

In May 2015 his own sitcom Peter Kays Car Share began to air. The series was a success and a second series was commissioned to start in April 2017. In October 2015, he starred in Cradle to Grave another BBC sitcom based on Danny Bakers life as a teenager.

On 19 July 2016, Kay was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Arts degree from the University of Salford at Salford’s Lowry Theatre.
===Return to stand-up===
In November 2009, after an absence of seven years, Kay announced a return to stand-up with four (later extended to 20) dates at the Manchester Arena the following April with a show entitled The Tour That Doesnt Tour Tour...Now On Tour. Demand for tickets caused him to announce soon after that the show would be toured. In January 2012, the tour entered the Guinness Book of World Records as the most successful stand-up comedy tour of all time, playing to a total of 1.2 million people.
Kays tour faced criticism when his disabled fans were hit with bills of up to £39 on premium phone lines booking tour tickets
In November 2017, Kay announced his intention to return to Stand-up with his first tour in eight years. Peter Kay Live: Have Gags, Will Travel was scheduled to begin touring in 2018, beginning with the Genting Arena in April before touring at venues such as SSE Hydro, Manchester Arena, The O2 Arena, First Direct Arena, SSE Arena Belfast, Sheffield Arena and Echo Arena Liverpool. On 13 December 2017, Kay announced that he was cancelling all future work projects (including Peter Kay Live: Have Gags Will Travel tour) for family reasons.
He has asked that the media respect his and his familys privacy.
The tour hit criticism again regarding phone calls as fans were charged 62p per minute to call premium rate phone lines to claim ticket refunds
===Theatre work===
In February 2007, Kay played flamboyant gay director Roger DeBris in the Mel Brooks musical The Producers at Manchesters Palace Theatre, Manchester Palace Theatre for 120 shows.{{citation needed date=May 2015}}

===Guest appearances===
He appeared in the first episode of the 2002 series of Linda Green, playing a pizza delivery man who ended up being something of a soulmate to the eponymous heroine. He has had two roles in Coronation Street. The first, in the late 1990s, was a brief appearance as a shopfitter, but in January 2004 he co-wrote his own scenes, appearing alongside Sally Lindsay, who played Shelley Unwin.
On 17 June 2006, Kay appeared in the Doctor Who episode "Love &amp; Monsters".
His character, the sinister Victor Kennedy, proved to be an alien called the Abzorbaloff in disguise. Kay was included in the Independent on Sundays "Happy List" in 2009 as "simply Britains best comedian", and – as an exception to their general rule – was included again in 2010 for also raising funds for Children in Need.
On 9 September 2017, Kay took part in the "We Are Manchester" benefit concert to mark the reopening of Manchester Arena (2017 Manchester Arena bombing following the terrorist attack in May). He gave a speech to the crowd before introducing the concerts headline act Noel Gallaghers High Flying Birds.
