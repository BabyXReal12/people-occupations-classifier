In 1978, Shandling performed his first stand-up routine at the The Comedy Store Comedy Store in Los Angeles, California Los Angeles. A year later, Shandling was one of the few performers to cross the picket line when a group of comedians organized a boycott against the Comedy Store, protesting owner Mitzi Shores policy of not paying comedians to perform. According to William Knoedelseder, Shandling "was the scion of a family with ... decidedly antiunion views. He had not shared the struggling comic experience. He was a successful sitcom writer trying to break into stand-up, and prior to the strike, Shore had refused to put him in the regular lineup because she didnt think he was good enough. Of course, that changed the minute he crossed the picket line."<ref>{{cite web last=Knoedelseder first=William year=2009 title=Im Dying Up Here: Heartbreak and High Times in Stand-Up Comedys Golden Era publisher=Public Affairs Books location=New York pages=205–06 isbn=1-58648-896-1}}</ref>

The series subverted the standard sitcom format by having its characters openly acknowledge that they were all part of a television series. Building on a concept that harked back to The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, in which George Burns would frequently break the "fourth wall" and speak directly to the audience, Shandlings series went so far as to incorporate the audience and elements of the studio itself into the storylines, calling attention to the artifice of the show.<ref name=variety /><ref name=dollying>{{cite web url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/20/entertainment/et-shandling20 title=Dollying through that fourth wall on Its Garry Shandlings Show: The funny guy deconstructed the sitcom on his Showtime series, which is newly out on DVD first=Robert last=Lloyd work=Los Angeles Times date=October 20, 2009 accessdate=March 24, 2016 archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408040027/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/20/entertainment/et-shandling20 archive-date=April 8, 2016 dead-url=yes df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://eddieonfilm.blogspot.com/2010/09/garry-called-me-up-and-asked-if-i-would.html title=Edward Copelands Tangents: Garry called me up and asked if I would write this 25th anniversary tribute first=Edward last=Copel date= website=eddieonfilm.blogspot.com accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref>
