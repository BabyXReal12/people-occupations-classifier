with paternal grandparents Jacob Shandling, Anna Dodge from Russia and maternal grandparents Charles Singer from New York, and Aida Goovitsh from London.

The family moved to Tucson so that Garrys older brother, Barry Philip (1947-1960),
could receive treatment for cystic fibrosis and the hot dry air.
Barry died of the disease when Garry was 10.
Shandling first obtained a ham radio license at age thirteen
holding the callsigns W7BKG,
WN7BKG,
and WA7BKG (in 1969),
belonging to Old Pueblo Radio Club,
The Rag Chewers Club,
American Radio Relay League, and sent QSL cards;

later holding the call sign KD6OY
and apparently let his license lapse some time in the 1990s.
Shandling attended Palo Verde High School (Arizona) Palo Verde High School, sometimes reading his humorous class essays to classes.
==Career==
After graduation from Palo Verde High School (Arizona) Palo Verde High School,
he attended the University of Arizona in Tucson, majoring in electrical engineering for three years. One day after leaving a laboratory class for a drink of water, he couldnt bear rejoining the class.
He eventually completed a degree in marketing and pursued a year of postgraduate studies in creative writing,
and contributed humorous articles to small magazines.
When he was nineteen, he drove two hours to a club in Phoenix, where he showed some jokes to George Carlin, who was appearing. The next day, on a repeat round-trip, Carlin told him that he had funny stuff on every page and should keep at it.
In 1973, Shandling moved to Los Angeles. He worked at an advertising agency for a time, took a script writing class, wrote a Spec script speculative script with the son of a script writer, and then sold a script for the popular NBC sitcom Sanford and Son.
In addition to Sanford and Son, Shandling wrote scripts for the sitcoms Welcome Back, Kotter and attended a story meeting for Threes Company.
In the late 1970s, Shandling was in an improv group with Paul Willson.
In 1977, Shandling was involved in an auto accident in Beverly Hills, California Beverly Hills that left him in critical condition for two days and hospitalized for 2 weeks with a crushed spleen.
During his hospital stay he had a life changing near death experience. Shandling stated, "I had a vivid near-death experience that involved a voice asking, "Do you want to continue leading Garry Shandlings life?" Without thinking, I said, "Yes." Since then, Ive been stuck living in the physical world while knowing, without a doubt, that theres something much more meaningful within it all. That realization is what drives my life and work."
The accident inspired him to pursue a career as a comedian,
and he later turned the accident into part of his comedy.
===Stand-up comedy===
Shandling became a stand-up comedian because, one day at a story meeting for "Threes Company,"  one of the producers had complained, "Well, Chrissie wouldnt say that."
<blockquote>
 "I just locked, I said, I dont think I can do this. And I stopped right there and went on to perform." - Shandling
</blockquote>
In 1978, Shandling performed his first stand-up routine at the The Comedy Store Comedy Store in Los Angeles, California Los Angeles. A year later, Shandling was one of the few performers to cross the picket line when a group of comedians organized a boycott against the Comedy Store, protesting owner Mitzi Shores policy of not paying comedians to perform. According to William Knoedelseder, Shandling "was the scion of a family with ... decidedly antiunion views. He had not shared the struggling comic experience. He was a successful sitcom writer trying to break into stand-up, and prior to the strike, Shore had refused to put him in the regular lineup because she didnt think he was good enough. Of course, that changed the minute he crossed the picket line."
His persona was an anxiety-ridden, grimacing, guarded, confused man on the verge of losing control.
After a couple of years on the road, a talent scout from The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson booked him to appear as a guest in 1981. Shandling substituted for Carson on a regular basis until 1987,
when he left to focus on his cable show leaving Jay Leno as permanent guest host and Carsons eventual successor.{{citation needed date=March 2016}}

In 1984, Shandling performed his first stand-up special Garry Shandling: Alone in Vegas for Showtime (TV network) Showtime,
followed by a second televised special in 1986 titled The Garry Shandling Show: 25th Anniversary Special, also for Showtime.
In 1991, a third special titled Garry Shandling: Stand-Up was part of the HBO Comedy Hour.
===Television series===
====Its Garry Shandlings Show====
In 1985, Shandling and Alan Zweibel went on to create Its Garry Shandlings Show. Through 1990, it ran for 72 episodes on Showtime (TV network) Showtime. The edited reruns played on the Fox Broadcasting Company Fox network beginning in 1988.
Shandling wrote 15 episodes of the series.

The series subverted the standard sitcom format by having its characters openly acknowledge that they were all part of a television series. Building on a concept that harked back to The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, in which George Burns would frequently break the "fourth wall" and speak directly to the audience, Shandlings series went so far as to incorporate the audience and elements of the studio itself into the storylines, calling attention to the artifice of the show.
The series was nominated for four Emmy Awards,
including one for Shandling. He won an American Comedy Award for Funniest Male Performance in a Series, and won four CableACE awards, two for Best Comedy Series. The show also won an award for TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy Outstanding Achievement in Comedy from the Television Critics Association.

Shandling wrote 38 episodes of the series and directed three in the series final season. He was nominated for 18 Emmy Awards for the series;
five for acting, seven for writing, and six for being co-executive producer with Brad Grey.
He won one Emmy Award for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series for the series finale "List of The Larry Sanders Show episodes#Season Six Flip."
