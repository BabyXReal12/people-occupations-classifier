Arthur "Harpo" Marx (born Adolph Marx; November 23, 1888 – September 28, 1964) was an American comedian, actor, mime artist, and musician, and the second-oldest of the Marx Brothers. In contrast to the mainly verbal comedy of his brothers Groucho Marx and Chico Marx, Harpos comic style was visual, being an example of both clown and pantomime traditions. He wore a curly reddish blonde wig, and never spoke during performances (he blew a horn or Whistling whistled to communicate). He frequently used Theatrical property props such as a horn cane, made up of a lead pipe, tape, and a bulbhorn, and he played the harp in most of his films.
==Early life==
Harpo was born on November 23, 1888 in Manhattan. He grew up in a neighborhood now known as Carnegie Hill on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, on East 93rd Street off Lexington Avenue. The turn-of-the-century tenement that Harpo later called (in his memoir Harpo Speaks!) "the first real home I can remember" was populated with European immigrants, mostly artisans—which even included a glass blower. Just across the street were the oldest brownstones in the area, owned by people like David L. Loew and William Orth.

Harpos parents were Sam Marx (called "Frenchie" throughout his life) and his wife, Minnie Marx Minnie Schoenberg Marx. Minnies brother was Al Shean. Marxs family was Jewish. His mother was from East Frisia in Germany, and his father was a native of Alsace in France and worked as a tailor.
Harpo received little formal education and left grade school at age eight (mainly due to bullying)
during his second attempt to pass the second grade. He began to work, gaining employment in numerous odd jobs alongside his brother Chico Marx Chico to contribute to the family income, including selling newspapers, working in a butcher shop, and as an errand office boy.
==Career==
===On stage===
In January 1910, Harpo joined two of his brothers, Groucho Marx Julius (later "Groucho") and Gummo Marx Milton (later "Gummo"), to form "The Three Nightingales", later changed to simply "The Marx Brothers". Multiple stories—most unsubstantiated—exist to explain Harpos evolution as the "silent" character in the brothers act. In his memoir, Groucho wrote that Harpo simply wasnt very good at memorizing dialogue, and thus was ideal for the role of the "dunce who couldnt speak", a common character in vaudeville acts of the time.
Harpo gained his stage name during a card game at the Orpheum Theatre in Galesburg, Illinois. The dealer (Art Fisher) called him "Harpo" because he played the harp.
He learned how to hold it properly from a picture of an angel playing a harp that he saw in a five-and-dime. No one in town knew how to play the harp, so Harpo tuned it as best he could, starting with one basic note and tuning it from there. Three years later he found out he had tuned it incorrectly, but he could not have tuned it properly; if he had, the strings would have broken each night. Harpos method placed much less tension on the strings.{{citation needed date=December 2011}} Although he played this way for the rest of his life, he did try to learn how to play correctly, and he spent considerable money hiring the best teachers. They spent their time listening to him, fascinated by the way he played.
The major exception was Mildred Dilling, a professional harpist who did teach Harpo the proper techniques of the instrument and collaborated with him regularly when he had difficulty with various compositions.
In the autobiography Harpo Speaks (1961), he recounts how Chico Marx Chico found him jobs playing piano to accompany silent film silent movies. Unlike Chico, Harpo could play only two songs on the piano, "Waltz Me Around Again, Willie" and "Love Me and the World Is Mine," but he adapted this small repertoire in different tempos to suit the action on the screen. He was also seen playing a portion of Rachmaninoffs "Prelude in C# minor" in A Day at the Races (film) A Day at the Races and chords on the piano in A Night at the Opera (film) A Night at the Opera, in such a way that the piano sounded much like a harp, as a prelude to actually playing the harp in that scene.

Harpo had changed his name from Adolph to Arthur by 1911. This was due primarily to his dislike for the name Adolph (as a child, he was routinely called "Ahdie" instead). The name change may have also happened because of the similarity between Harpos name and Adolph Marks, a prominent show business attorney in Chicago.
Urban legends stating that the name change came about during World War I due to anti-German sentiment in the US, or during World War II because of the stigma that Adolf Hitler imposed on the name, are groundless.
===On film===

His first screen appearance was in the film Humor Risk (1921), with his brothers, although according to Groucho, it was only screened once and then Lost film lost. Four years later, Harpo appeared without his brothers in Too Many Kisses, four years before the brothers first released film, The Cocoanuts (1929). In Too Many Kisses, Harpo spoke the only line he would ever speak on-camera in a movie: "You sure you cant move?"
(said to the films tied-up hero before punching him). Fittingly, it was a silent movie, and the audience saw only his lips move and the line on a title card.

Harpo was often cast as Chicos eccentric partner-in-crime, whom he would often help by playing charades to tell of Grouchos problem, and/or annoy by giving Chico his leg, either to give it a rest or as an alternative to a handshake.

Harpo became known for prop-laden Visual gag sight gags, in particular the seemingly Hammerspace infinite number of odd things stored in his Overcoat topcoats oversized pockets. In the film Horse Feathers (1932), Groucho, referring to an impossible situation, tells Harpo that he cannot "burn the candle at both ends." Harpo immediately produces from within his coat pocket a lit candle burning at both ends. In the same film, a homeless man on the street asks Harpo for money for a cup of coffee, and he subsequently produces a steaming cup, complete with saucer, from inside his coat. In Duck Soup, he produces a lit blowtorch to light a cigar. As author Joe Adamson put in his book, Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo, "The president of the college has been shouted down by a mute."

Harpo often used facial expressions and mime to get his point across. One of his facial expressions, which he used in every Marx Brothers film and stage play, beginning with Fun in Hi Skule, was known as "the Gookie." Harpo created it by mimicking the expression of Mr. Gehrke, a New York tobacconist who would make a similar face while concentrating on rolling cigars.
Harpo further distinguished his character by wearing a "fright wig". Early in his career it was dyed pink, as evidenced by color film posters of the time and by allusions to it in films, with character names such as "Pinky" in Duck Soup. It tended to show as blonde on-screen due to the black-and-white film stock at the time. Over time, he darkened the pink to more of a reddish color, again alluded to in films with character names such as "Rusty".

His non-speaking in his early films was occasionally referred to by the other Marx Brothers, who were careful to imply that his characters not speaking was a choice rather than a disability. They would make joking reference to this part of his act. For example, in Animal Crackers (1930 film) Animal Crackers his character was ironically dubbed "The Professor". In The Cocoanuts, this exchange occurred:
* Groucho: "Who is this?"
* Chico: "Dats-a my partner, but he no speak."
* Groucho: "Oh, thats your wikt:silent partner silent partner!"

In later films, Harpo was put into situations where he would repeatedly attempt to convey a vital message to another person, but only did so through nonverbal means, usually by whistling or pantomime. These scenes reinforced the idea that the character was unable to speak.

In 1933, following U.S. diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union, he spent six weeks in Moscow as a performer and goodwill ambassador.
His tour was a huge success. Harpos name was transliterated into Russian, using the Cyrillic alphabet, as ХАРПО МАРКС, and was billed as such during his Soviet Union appearances. Harpo, having no knowledge of Russian, pronounced it as Exapno Mapcase. At that time Harpo and the Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov became friends and even performed a routine on stage together.
During this time he served as a secret courier; delivering communiques to and from the US embassy in Moscow at the request of Ambassador William Christian Bullitt, Jr., smuggling the messages in and out of Russia by taping a sealed envelope to his leg beneath his trousers, an event described in David Fromkins 1995 book In the Time of the Americans.
In Harpo Speaks, Marx describes his relief at making it out of the Soviet Union, recalling how "I pulled up my pants, ripped off the tape, unwound the straps, handed over the dispatches from Ambassador Bullitt, and gave my leg its first scratch in ten days."
The Russia trip was later memorialized in a bizarre science fiction novella, The Foreign Hand Tie by Randall Garrett, a tale of telepathic spies which is full of references to the Marx Brothers and their films.
(The title itself is a Marx-like pun on the dual ideas of a "foreign hand" and a style of neckwear known as a "four-in-hand knot four-in-hand tie.")

In 1936, he was one of a number of performers and celebrities to appear as caricatures in the The Walt Disney Company Walt Disney Production of Mickeys Polo Team. Harpo was part of a team of polo-playing movie stars which included Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. His mount was an ostrich. Walt Disney would later have Harpo (with Groucho and Chico) appear as one of King Coles "Fiddlers Three" in the Silly Symphony Mother Goose Goes Hollywood.

Harpo was also caricatured in Popeye the Sailor filmography (Fleischer Studios)#1934 Sock-A-Bye Baby (1934), an early episode of the Popeye cartoon series created by Fleischer Studios. Harpo is playing the harp, and wakes up Popeyes baby, and then Popeye kills him. (After Popeye hits him, a halo appears over his head and he floats to the sky.)

Friz Frelengs 1936 Merrie Melodies cartoon The Coo-Coo Nut Grove featuring animal versions of assorted celebrities, caricatures Harpo as a bird with a red beak. When he first appears, he is chasing a woman, but the woman later turns out to be Groucho.

Harpo also took an interest in painting, and a few of his works can be seen in his autobiography. In the book, Marx tells a story about how he tried to paint a nude female model, but froze up because he simply did not know how to paint properly. The model took pity on him, however, showing him a few basic strokes with a brush, until finally Harpo (fully clothed) took the models place as the subject and the naked woman painted his portrait.
In 1955, Harpo made an appearance on the sitcom I Love Lucy, in which he and Lucille Ball re-enacted the famous mirror scene from the Marx Brothers movie Duck Soup (1933 film) Duck Soup (1933).
In this scene, they are both supposed to be Harpo, not Groucho; he stays the same and she is dressed as him. About this time, he also appeared on NBCs The Martha Raye Show.

Harpo recorded an album of harp music for RCA Victor (Harp by Harpo, 1952) and two for Mercury Records (Harpo in Hi-Fi, 1957; Harpo at Work, 1958).

Harpo and Chico played a television anthology episode of General Electric Theater entitled "The Incredible Jewelry Robbery" entirely in pantomime in 1959, with a brief surprise appearance by Groucho at the end.

Harpo made television appearances in the 1960s. In 1960, he appeared with Ernest Truex in an episode of The DuPont Show with June Allyson entitled "A Silent Panic". He played a deaf-mute who, as a "mechanical man" in a department store window, witnessed a gangland murder. In 1961, he made guest appearances on Today (NBC program) The Today Show, Play Your Hunch, Candid Camera, Ive Got a Secret, Heres Hollywood, Art Linkletters House Party, Grouchos quiz show You Bet Your Life, The Ed Sullivan Show, and Your Surprise Package.

In November 1961 he guest-starred with Carol Burnett in an installment of The DuPont Show of the Week entitled "The Wonderful World of Toys". The show was filmed in Central Park and featured Marx playing "Autumn Leaves (1945 song) Autumn Leaves" on the harp. Other stars appearing in the episode included Eva Gabor, Audrey Meadows, Mitch Miller and Milton Berle. A visit to the set inspired poet Robert Lowell to compose a poem about Marx.

Harpos two final television appearances came less than a month apart in late 1962. He portrayed a guardian angel on Columbia Broadcasting System CBSs The Red Skelton Show on September 25. He guest starred as himself on October 20 in the episode "Musicale" of American Broadcasting Company ABCs Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (TV series) Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, a sitcom starring Fess Parker, based on the 1939 Frank Capra film.
==Personal life==

Harpo married actress Susan Fleming on September 28, 1936. The wedding became public knowledge after President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent the couple a telegram of congratulations the following month.
Harpos marriage, like Gummos, was lifelong. (Groucho was divorced three times, Zeppo twice, Chico once.) The couple adopted four children: Bill, Alex, Jimmy, and Minnie. When he was asked by George Burns in 1948 how many children he planned to adopt, he answered, "I’d like to adopt as many children as I have windows in my house. So when I leave for work, I want a kid in every window, waving goodbye."

Harpo was good friends with theater critic Alexander Woollcott, and became a regular member of the Algonquin Round Table. He once said his main contribution was to be the audience for the quips of other members. In their play The Man Who Came to Dinner, George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart based the character of "Banjo" on Harpo. Harpo later played the role in Los Angeles opposite Woollcott, who had inspired the character of Sheridan Whiteside.

In 1961 Harpo published his autobiography, Harpo Speaks. Because he never spoke a word in character, many believed he actually was Muteness mute. In fact, radio and TV news recordings of his voice can be found on the Internet, in documentaries, and on bonus materials of Marx Brothers DVDs. A reporter who interviewed him in the early 1930s wrote that "he [Harpo] ... had a deep and distinguished voice, like a professional announcer", and like his brothers, spoke with a New York accent his entire life.
According to those who personally knew him, Harpos voice was much deeper than Grouchos, but it also sounded very similar to Chicos. His son, Bill, recalled that in private Harpo had a very deep and mature soft-spoken voice, but that he was "not verbose" like the other Marx brothers; Harpo preferred listening and learning from others.
Harpos final public appearance came on January 19, 1963 with singer/comedian Allan Sherman. Sherman burst into tears when Harpo announced his retirement from the entertainment business. Comedian Steve Allen, who was in the audience, remembered that Harpo spoke for several minutes about his career, and how he would miss it all, and repeatedly interrupted Sherman when he tried to speak. The audience found it charmingly ironic, Allen said, that Harpo, who had never before spoken on stage or screen, "wouldnt shut up!"
Harpo, an avid croquet player, was inducted into the Croquet Hall of Fame in 1979.
==Death==
Harpo Marx died on September 28, 1964 (his 28th wedding anniversary), at age 75 in a West Los Angeles hospital, one day after undergoing heart surgery.
Harpos death was said to have hit the surviving Marx brothers very hard. Grouchos son Arthur Marx, who attended the funeral with most of the Marx family, later said that Harpos funeral was the only time in his life that he ever saw his father cry. In his will, Harpo Marx donated his trademark harp to the State of Israel.
His remains were cremated, and his ashes were scattered at a golf course in Rancho Mirage, California.

==Legacy==
Harpo is most known for his signature outfit: trench coat with over-large pockets, red wig (he switched to a blonde one for every film after The Cocoanuts), top hat, and a comical horn heard in his movies. He was also well known for playing the harp, though he could not read music. Outside the professional harp community, he remains one of the best "ambassadors for the harp" the world has known. In time, his talent earned him an international reputation as he performed in movies as well as in stage shows around the globe.
In 2002, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Palm Springs Walk of Stars Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.
===Film portrayal===
Marx was portrayed by the actor J.M. Henry in the film Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle.
===Theatrical portrayals===
Marx was portrayed by actor Daniel Fortus in the Broadway production of Minnies Boys, a Broadway musical that ran for 64 performances at the Imperial Theatre from March to May 1970.

Actress Patricia Lopez played Harpo in a send-up of Hollywood movie making, the 1980 Broadway production, "A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the Ukraine", for which she won a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical.

He was also portrayed by Les Marsden in Groucho: A Life in Revue, which appeared off-Broadway at the Lucille Lortel Theatre. The show ran for 264 performances from October 1986 through May 1987.
