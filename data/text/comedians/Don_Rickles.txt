John Lasseter, one of the filmmakers of the Toy Story films, gave a heartfelt tweet to Rickles on Twitter.

Martin Scorsese, who directed him in Casino (1995 film) Casino in 1995, stated:
{{quote Don Rickles was a giant, a legend … and I can hear his voice now, skewering me for being so lofty. I had the honor of working with him on my picture Casino. He was a professional. He kept me doubled over with laughter every day on the set—yet he was a complete pro.<ref>[http://ew.com/movies/2017/04/06/martin-scorsese-don-rickles-tribute/ "Martin Scorsese pays tribute to Don Rickles: He made comedy into an art form"], Entertainment Weekly, April 6, 2017</ref>}}
