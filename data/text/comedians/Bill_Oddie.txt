==In popular culture==
In the fictional world of comedy character Alan Partridge, Oddie is an unseen presence in Alans life.

He has also been referenced, often humorously, by the hosts of Top Gear (2002 TV Series) Top Gear. Jeremy Clarkson even used a mask with Oddies face to escape speed cameras while racing the Nissan GT-R against the Shinkansen Bullet train in Japan in Episode 4 of Top Gear{{}}s 11th series. James May also raced in Finland against an Oddie lookalike who won the race.
