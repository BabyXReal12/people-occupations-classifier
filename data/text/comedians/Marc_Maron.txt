Maron continued to be a standup performer and also began to appear on television; his voice was used in episodes of Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist, and he hosted Short Attention Span Theater for a time. He also recorded half-hour specials for HBO and Comedy Central Presents as well as comedy showcases like the Cam Neely Cam Neely Foundation fundraiser, which also featured performers such as Jon Stewart, Denis Leary, and Steven Wright. He frequently appeared in the live alternative standup series he had organized with Janeane Garofalo called Eating It, which used the rock bar Luna Lounge in New Yorks Lower East Side as its venue, from the 1990s until the building was razed in 2005. {{Citation needed date=August 2012}}

His only major film credit for years was a small part credited as "angry promoter" in the 2000 Cameron Crowe film Almost Famous, in which he is first seen fighting with Noah Taylors character and then yelling at and chasing after the main characters as they drive away on a bus, at which point he yells, "Lock the gates!" which is now used in the intro to his podcasts.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181875 title=Almost Famous publisher=IMDb.com accessdate=February 10, 2011}}</ref> He was also featured at the Luna Lounge in the 1997 mockumentary Whos the Caboose? starring Sarah Silverman and Sam Seder.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0179526 title=Whos the Caboose?

His first one-man show, Jerusalem Syndrome, had an extended off-Broadway run in 2000 and was released in book form in 2001. In 2009, he began work shopping another one-man show, Scorching The Earth. According to Maron (in Scorching The Earth) these two shows "bookend" his relationship with his second wife, comic Mishna Wolff, which ended in a bitter divorce.

In May 2008, he toured with Eugene Mirman and Andy Kindler in Stand Uppity: Comedy That Makes You Feel Better About Yourself and Superior to Others. In January 2009, a collaboration with Sam Seder which had begun in September 2007 as a weekly hour-long video webcast became Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder, produced by Air America.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.breakroomlive.com  title=The Majority Report with Sam Seder &#124; Majority Report Radio  publisher=Breakroomlive.com  date=  accessdate=2012-10-11}}</ref> Until its cancellation in July 2009, the show was webcast live weekdays at 3&nbsp;pm Eastern, with episodes archived for later viewing as well. In its final incarnation, the show was quite informal, taking place in the actual break room of Air America Media, with the cafeteria vending machines just off-camera. This meant occasional distractions when Air America staff and management alike would occasionally come in for food and drink. Maron and Seder held court in an online "post-show chat" with viewers, in an even less formal continuation of each webcast, after the credits had rolled.

Marons standup comedy act is marked by his commitment to self-revelation and cultural analysis. He is particularly known for relentless on-stage exploration of his own relationships with family, girlfriends, and other standup comedians that he has known and befriended over his many years in the business. {{Citation needed date=August 2012}} In October 2013, Maron released his first hour long special via Netflix titled, Marc Maron: Thinky Pain.<ref>{{Citation last=Bangs first=Lance title=Marc Maron: Thinky Pain date=2013-10-15 url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3004634/ accessdate=2016-07-21}}</ref> Maron would follow this with another special titled, More Later, which he released in December 2015, on the website Epix.<ref>{{Citation last=Goldthwait first=Bobcat title=Marc Maron: More Later date=2015-12-04 url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5126220/ accessdate=2016-07-21}}</ref>

In 2012, he provided the voice of Magnus Hammersmith in three episodes of Metalocalypse. Maron has made two guest appearances as himself on Louis C.K.s show Louie (U.S. TV series) Louie, first in the third season episode Ikea/Piano Lesson<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2260196/ title="Louie" Ikea/Piano Lesson publisher=imdb.com accessdate=October 17, 2012}}</ref> and then again in the fourth season episode Pamela: Part 3.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3775768/ title="Louie" Pamela: Part 3 publisher=imdb.com accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>

A comedy special, Marc Maron: Too Real, was released on Netflix on September 5, 2017.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.netflix.com/title/80177405 title=Marc Maron: Too Real accessdate=September 5, 2017}}</ref>

On July 31, 2018 it was revealed that Maron would play a supporting role in Todd Phillipss upcoming Joker in other media Joker film starring Joaquin Phoenix as the title character alongside Robert De Niro and Zazie Beetz.

===Radio===
From almost the first day of the liberal talk radio network Air America (radio network) Air Americas broadcasts in 2004, Maron co-hosted Morning Sedition, a three-hour early-morning radio show with Mark Riley (American radio host) Mark Riley that aired weekdays from 6&nbsp;am to 9&nbsp;am Eastern time. The show was unique in the Air America lineup in its heavy reliance on both live and preproduced sketch comedy, utilizing the talents of staff writers as well as the on-air hosts. The format was a Left-wing politics left-leaning near-satire of typical morning "Buddy" radio programs, including recurring characters, interviews, and listener call-in segments, and it attracted a loyal fan base. {{Citation needed date=August 2012}}

As 2005 came to a end, it became known that Marons contract would not be renewed on its December 1, 2005, end date because of problems with then Air America executive Danny Goldberg. Goldberg reportedly did not "get" the comedy or agree with the satiric and often angry tone set by Maron and other writers (Jim Earl and Kent Jones (writer) Kent Jones) for a morning drive-time show. On November 28, 2005, it was officially announced that Marons contract had not been renewed. His last Morning Sedition broadcast was on December 16, 2005, and the show was discontinued shortly thereafter. {{Citation needed date=August 2012}}

On February 28, 2006, Maron began hosting a nighttime radio program with Jim Earl as sidekick for KEIB KTLK Progressive Talk 1150AM in Los Angeles called The Marc Maron Show from 10:00&nbsp;pm until midnight PST. The program was frequently delayed (sometimes for over an hour) owing to KTLKs contractual agreement to broadcast local sports events that would often go into overtime. The Marc Maron Show was never nationally syndicated by Air America despite reported contractual clauses promising such. The show was streamed online live, but the show was not publicized, and the existence of the stream was not well promoted. {{Citation needed date=February 2011}}

On July 5, it was announced that Marons final episode would be on July 14. A few days before that date, Maron bluntly discussed his long struggle with Air America Radios executives on-air. In 2008, Marc and Sam Seder expanded their prior collaboration on a weekly hour-long video webcast (streamed at The Sam Seder Show website) into a daily show (and "post-show chat") produced by Air America Media called Maron v. Seder. The show became Breakroom Live with Maron & Seder starting in 2009 and could be viewed on Air America Medias website. On July 15, 2009, after less than one year, Air America Media canceled Breakroom Live. According to the shows hosts, the cancellation was for financial reasons. Ironically, the day before the cancellation, the show got some of the first real publicity it had ever received when MaximumFun.org posted its podcast of an interview with Maron on The Sound of Young America. {{Citation needed date=August 2012}}

On the final Breakroom Live webcast, Maron said that this marked the third time since 2005 hed been told by an executive at the network that his services would not be required in the immediate future. Co-host Sam Seder pointed out that this would be the end of his fourth show at Air America since the troubled networks inception. {{Citation needed date=August 2012}}

Maron also speaks openly of his caring for numerous stray cats that he takes into his home. This has led to him to refer to his home, on the WTF Podcast, as the "Cat Ranch." Maron lives in Highland Park, Los Angeles, with his three cats, Monkey, Boomer, and LaFonda.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.catster.com/lifestyle/marc-maron-cat-adoption-feral title=Marc Maron Learned the Meaning of "Feral" from a Cat accessdate=May 8, 2013}}</ref> After Boomer went missing, Maron began incorporating the catchphrase "Boomer lives!" into various portions of the podcast.
