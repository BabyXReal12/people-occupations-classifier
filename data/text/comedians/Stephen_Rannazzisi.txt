<!---His future wife Tracy worked on the 24th floor, but was in mid-commute at the time of the attacks.-->
He said the events inspired him to move to Los Angeles and pursue stand-up comedy. In September 2015, after being contacted by a reporter from The New York Times for an article debunking his claim,
