=== Bill Cosby routine ===
{{see also Bill Cosby sexual assault cases}}
On October 16, 2014, at the Philadelphia club Trocadero Theatre The Trocadero, Buress was recorded doing an extended routine about Bill Cosby sexual assault allegations existing rape allegations against comedian Bill Cosby.
Buress addressed Cosbys legacy of "talk[ing] down" to young black men about their style of dress and lifestyle. Buress criticized the actors public moralizing by saying, "Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby, so that kind of brings you down a couple notches." The audience appeared to respond to Buresss accusation with incredulity; he encouraged everyone to search for "Bill Cosby rape" when they got home.
Buress had been doing the same Cosby routine for the previous six months with little response,
but the October performance went viral after being posted on Philadelphia (magazine) Philadelphia magazines website.
A media circus media firestorm ensued, with numerous publications tackling the question of how Cosby had managed to maintain, as Buress called it in his set, a "Teflon image" despite more than a decade of public sex-abuse accusations.
Comedian Eddie Murphy later referenced Buresss role in the allegations coming to light while impersonating Cosby during his 2015 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor acceptance speech, mockingly playing Cosby as threatening Buress life.
(Cosby himself won the Twain Prize in 2009, after having refused it twice.)

==Personal life==
Buress is an atheist.
After living in New York City, Buress moved back to Chicago in 2017 and settled in its Wicker Park, Chicago Wicker Park neighborhood.
In December 2017, Buress was arrested in Miami for Public intoxication disorderly intoxication.
Bystander footage of the arrest showed Buress mocking the police officers and demanding to know why he was being arrested.
The arrest report revealed that Buress was detained because he approached the police officers and would not stop asking them to call an Uber (company) Uber for him.
Buress later stated, "I asked the [officer] to call me an Uber, and he said, No. He told me to leave the street. I go into this bar to get a phone charger for an Uber. He follows me into the bar, and told me Im too drunk to go inside. [...] If I cant be on the street, where do you want me to be? I ask him. I was in a state of trying to get home. [...] I dont really believe I was at fault."
The case was later dismissed.
