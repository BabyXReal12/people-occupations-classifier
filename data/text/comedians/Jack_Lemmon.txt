==Career==

Lemmons film debut was a bit part as a plasterer/painter in the 1949 film The Lady Takes a Sailor, but he went unnoticed until his debut, opposite Judy Holliday, in the 1954 comedy It Should Happen to You.<ref name=tca/> Lemmon worked with actresses such as Marilyn Monroe, Natalie Wood, Betty Grable, Janet Leigh, Shirley MacLaine, Lee Remick, Romy Schneider, Doris Day, Kim Novak, Judy Holliday, Rita Hayworth, June Allyson, Virna Lisi, Ann-Margret and Sophia Loren. He was close friends with actors Tony Curtis, Ernie Kovacs, Walter Matthau and Kevin Spacey. He made two films with Curtis, and fifteen with Matthau.

Early in Lemmons career he met comedian Ernie Kovacs while co-starring with him in Operation Mad Ball. Lemmon and Kovacs became close friends and appeared together in two subsequent films, Bell, Book and Candle and It Happened to Jane. In 1977, Public Broadcasting Service PBS broadcast a compilation series of Kovacs television work, and Lemmon served as the narrator of the series. Lemmon discussed his friendship with Kovacs in the documentary Ernie Kovacs: Televisions Original Genius.

He was a favorite of director Billy Wilder, starring in the films Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, Irma la Douce, The Fortune Cookie, Avanti!, The Front Page (1974 film) The Front Page, and Buddy Buddy. Wilder felt Lemmon had a natural tendency toward overacting that had to be tempered; the Wilder biography Nobodys Perfect quotes the director as saying, "Lemmon, I would describe him as a ham, a fine ham, and with ham you have to trim a little fat." The biography quotes Lemmon as saying, "I am particularly susceptible to the parts I play... If my character was having a nervous breakdown, I started to have one."

He enjoyed longtime working relationships with both Blake Edwards, starring in Days of Wine and Roses (film) Days of Wine and Roses (1962), The Great Race (1965) and Thats Life! (film) Thats Life! (1986), and Richard Quine, starring in My Sister Eileen (1955 film) My Sister Eileen, Operation Mad Ball, Bell, Book and Candle, It Happened to Jane, and How to Murder Your Wife. Quine also directed Lemmons screen test when the actor was signed by Columbia.

==Singing and piano playing==
Lemmons singing voice was first heard on two film soundtracks in 1955, Three for the Show with Betty Grable and My Sister Eileen (1955 film) My Sister Eileen. He also performed songs in the 1956 film You Cant Run Away from It with Stubby Kaye and June Allyson. His first solo album, A Twist of Lemmon, was released in 1958 on Epic Records. While filming Some Like It Hot with Marilyn Monroe in 1959, Lemmon released a second album, Some Like It Hot. Both featured Lemmons singing and piano solos.

The two Epic albums were later released as A Twist of Lemmon/Some Like It Hot, a single CD on Collectors Choice Music, in 2001. Two singles, "Daphne"/"Sleepy Lagoon" (released in 1959) and "Im Forever Blowing Bubbles"/"I Cover the Waterfront (song) I Cover the Waterfront" (released in 1960) did not appear on either album. Epic released a third single in 1960, Lemmons piano solo of the theme to the film The Apartment, backed with his own composition "Lemmon Blues". In 1963, Lemmon released a third album, this time on Capitol Records, entitled Jack Lemmon Plays Piano Selections from Irma La Douce.

==Awards and career highlights==
Lemmon was awarded the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1956 for Mister Roberts (1955 film) Mister Roberts (1955) and the Academy Award for Best Actor Best Actor Oscar for Save the Tiger (1973), becoming the first actor to achieve this rare double (the only other actors to achieve this are: Robert De Niro, Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, Kevin Spacey, and Denzel Washington).<ref name=tca/> He was also nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his role in the controversial film Missing (1982 film) Missing in 1982, and for his roles in Some Like It Hot (1959), The Apartment (1960), Days of Wine and Roses (film) Days of Wine and Roses (1962), The China Syndrome (1979), for which he was also awarded Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival, and Tribute (1980 film) Tribute (1980). He won another Cannes award for his performance in Missing (which received the Palme dOr as well). In 1986, the U.S. National Board of Review of Motion Pictures gave Lemmon a "Career Achievement" award;<ref>{{Cite web  url=http://www.nationalboardofreview.org/award-years/1986/  title=1986 Award Winners  author=  date=2016  publisher=National Board of Review of Motion Pictures  work=  accessdate=October 31, 2016 }}</ref> two years later, the American Film Institute gave him its AFI Life Achievement Award Lifetime Achievement Award.

Days of Wine and Roses (film) Days of Wine and Roses (1962) was a favorite role of Lemmons. He portrayed Joe Clay, a young, fun-loving alcoholic businessman. In that film, Lemmon delivered the line, "My name is Joe Clay ... Im an alcoholic." Three and a half decades later, he stated on the television program Inside the Actors Studio that he was a recovering alcoholic.<ref name=tca/>

Lemmons production company JML produced Cool Hand Luke in 1967. Paul Newman was grateful to Lemmon for his support and offered him the role of the Sundance Kid, later played by Robert Redford in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, but Lemmon turned it down. He did not like riding horses and he felt hed already played too many aspects of the Sundance Kids character before.<ref>A slice of Lemmon for extra character, Bob Flynn, Panorama, p. 7, Canberra Times, August 15, 1998</ref>

Lemmon appeared in many films partnered with actor Walter Matthau. Among their pairings was 1968s The Odd Couple (film) The Odd Couple, as The Odd Couple (film) Felix Ungar (Lemmon) and The Odd Couple (film) Oscar Madison (Matthau). The first film they starred in together was The Fortune Cookie (for which Matthau won the 1966 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), The Front Page (1974 film) The Front Page and Buddy Buddy. In 1971, Lemmon directed Matthau in the comedy Kotch. It was the only movie that Lemmon directed and Matthau was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for his performance.

Additionally, Lemmon and Matthau had small parts in Oliver Stones 1991 film, JFK (film) JFK (the only film in which both appeared without sharing screen time). In 1993, the duo teamed again to star in Grumpy Old Men (film) Grumpy Old Men. The film was a surprise hit, earning the two actors a new generation of young fans.  During the rest of the decade, they would star together in Grumpier Old Men, Out to Sea, and the widely panned The Odd Couple II. In 1996, Lemmon was awarded the Golden Bear Honorary Golden Bear award at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival.<ref name="Berlinale1996">{{cite web  url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1996/03_preistr_ger_1996/03_Preistraeger_1996.html  title=Berlinale: 1996 Prize Winners  accessdate=January 1, 2012  work=berlinale.de}}</ref> In 1997, Lemmon was a guest voice on The Simpsons episode "The Twisted World of Marge Simpson," playing the character Frank Ormand, owner of the pretzel business that Marge Simpson franchised. The recurring Simpsons character List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Gil Gunderson Gil Gunderson, voiced by Dan Castellaneta, is an ongoing parody of Lemmons character in Glengarry Glen Ross.

At the 55th Golden Globe Awards 1998 Golden Globe Awards, he was nominated for "Best Actor in a Made for TV Movie" for his role in 12 Angry Men (1997 film) Twelve Angry Men, losing to Ving Rhames. After accepting the award, Rhames asked Lemmon to come on stage and, in a move that stunned the audience, gave his award to him. (The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which presents the Golden Globes, had a second award made and sent to Rhames.)<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk3EgDPZD0w# Ving Rhames gives his Golden Globe to Jack Lemmon (1998)]</ref> He received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1988.

Lemmon won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his role as Morrie Schwartz in his final television role, Tuesdays with Morrie (film) Tuesdays with Morrie. His final film role was an uncredited one: the narrator in Robert Redfords film The Legend of Bagger Vance.

Actor Kevin Spacey recalled that Lemmon is remembered for always making time for other people. Already regarded as a legend, he met teenage Spacey backstage after a theater performance and spoke to him about pursuing an acting career.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drnz1mbpui4  title=Charlie Rose – Kevin Spacey / Jamaica Kincaid  publisher=YouTube  date=  accessdate=December 12, 2010}}</ref> Spacey would later work with Lemmon in The Murder of Mary Phagan (1987), Dad (film) Dad (1989), the critically acclaimed film Glengarry Glen Ross (film) Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), and on stage in a revival of Long Days Journey into Night. Lemmon was Spaceys mentor, and reportedly taught Spacey that people who do well in a business have an obligation to "send the elevator back down" to help lift people starting out on the ground floor.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEQkTeZQnw4&t=32s  title=Jameson First Shot  publisher=YouTube  date=September 13, 2011  accessdate=June 28, 2013}}</ref>

In his autobiography, My Life, Burt Reynolds recalls Lemmon as the quintessential gentleman who never spoke ill of anyone, even if they deserved it. This kindness backfired for Reynolds: prior to accepting the lead in W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings (1975), directed by John G. Avildsen, Reynolds asked Lemmon, whom Avildsen had directed in Save the Tiger (1973) for an opinion of Avildsen as a director. Lemmon told Reynolds that Avildsen was "okay", and Reynolds accepted the role. After the film was released and his experiences during the production proved unhappy, Reynolds complained to Lemmon and described Avildsen as an "asshole", whereupon Lemmon replied, "I guess you could say that."<ref>Reynolds, Burt. (1994) My Life. New York: Hyperion. {{ISBN 0-7868-6130-4}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Lemmon was married twice. His first wife was actress Cynthia Stone, with whom he had a son, Chris Lemmon (born 1954). His second wife was actress Felicia Farr, with whom he had a daughter, Courtney (born 1966). Farr had a daughter from a previous relationship (her marriage to Lee Farr) named Denise. Lemmon was a Catholicism Catholic.<ref>Don Widener Lemmon: A Biography (1975), page 7</ref> He publicly announced his alcoholism during a 1998 interview on Inside the Actors Studio.<ref>{{cite web url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/29/entertainment/la-et-st-james-lipton-20130529 title=James Liptons Inside the Actors Studio hits 250 on changing Bravo author=Meredith Blake publisher=Los Angeles Times date=May 29, 2013 accessdate=July 30, 2013}}</ref>

To golfers everywhere Lemmon was known as the "star" of the celebrity-packed third round telecast of the annual AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, held at Pebble Beach Golf Links each February. Lemmons packed gallery was there not only for his humor but also to root him on in his lifelong quest to "make the cut" to round 4, something he was never able to achieve. The amateur who helps his team most in the Pro-Am portion is annually awarded the Jack Lemmon Award.

During the 1980s and 1990s Lemmon served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute.<ref>{{cite book author1=Editor title=National Student Film Institute/L.A:  The Sixteenth Annual Los Angeles Student Film Festival date=June 10, 1994 location=The Directors Guild Theatre pages=10–11 accessdate=6 January 2018 ref=Program}}</ref><ref>{{cite book author1=Editor title=Los Angeles Student Film Institute: 13th Annual Student Film Festival date=June 7, 1991 location=The Directors Guild Theatre page=3 accessdate=6 January 2018 ref=Program}}</ref>
