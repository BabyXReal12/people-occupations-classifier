After paying dues on the club circuit, where she shared stages with noted comedians such as Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor, Page moved to Los Angeles, California in the early 1960s where she became a member of the comedy group Sanford and Son#Other characters Skillet, Leroy & Co. Skillet was Ernest "Skillet" Mayhand (1916–2007) and Leroy was Wilbert LeRoy Daniel (1928–1993). In Los Angeles, Page started honing the feisty approach to comedy that would make her famous.<ref name="NYT obit">{{cite news last=Watkins first=Mel author-link=Mel Watkins (author) date=September 18, 2002 title=LaWanda Page, 81, the Aunt On TVs Sanford and Son url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/18/obituaries/18PAGE.html work=The New York Times accessdate=November 5, 2017}}</ref> LaWanda Page and Redd Foxx (who portrayed Sanford and Son#Fred Sanford Fred Sanford) were very close friends from the time they were pre-teens, having attended school and grown up together in St. Louis. Eventually, both entered the field of comedy separately and performed their own stage acts. During her tenure as a stand-up comic, a career she continued into the 1990s, Page often was billed as "The Queen of Comedy" or "The Black Queen of Comedy".

Page recorded several live comedy albums for the Laff Records label in the late 1960s and early 1970s under her LaWanda Page stage name. Other than the relatively clean Sane Advice album, released two years after the run of Sanford and Son, Pages albums and stand-up material were raunchy blue comedy in nature. She was one of the few women who performed extended spoken word pieces in the Signifyin black signifying or toasting tradition. One release, a gold album gold-selling album called Watch It, Sucker!, was titled after one of her Aunt Esther characters catchphrases in order to capitalize on her newfound television fame.

===Sanford and Son (1973-1977)===
On Sanford and Son, Esther Anderson (Sanford and Son) Esther Anderson ("Aunt Esther") was the sister of Sanford and Son#Fred Sanford Fred Sanfords late wife Elizabeth. Page had been performing her comedy routine in nightclubs in St. Louis and then Los Angeles for several years, but had planned to leave show business to move back to St. Louis to take care of her ailing mother. When Redd Foxx was offered a sitcom in Los Angeles, he brought his childhood friend Page to the attention to one of the shows producers, who was already familiar with Page and her act. Foxx subsequently asked Page to read for the role of Aunt Esther. She was offered the role after she auditioned. However, prior to taping, producers became concerned when Page, whose experience was limited primarily to nightclub stages, seemed to have difficulty working in a sitcom format. Eventually, one of Sanford and Son{{}}s producers told Foxx that Page would need to be fired and that another actor would need to be cast before the show could begin taping. Foxx responded by insisting that Page keep the part, even threatening to walk away from the show if Page were fired. The producers relented, and Pages Aunt Esther went on to become one of the most popular TV sitcom characters of the 1970s.<ref>TV Guide, March 17–23, 1973.</ref> 

Pages Aunt Esther was a combination of devout churchgoer and tough-as-nails realist, unafraid to state whatever was on her mind. While her relationship with Foxxs character Fred G. Sanford was usually confrontational, she portrayed a tender side when it came to her nephew Sanford and Son#Lamont Sanford Lamont. Common issues between brother-in-law and sister-in-law were Sanfords lack of business success and lukewarm religious faith. Sometimes, primarily because of their shared love for Lamont and the late Elizabeth, the two adversaries managed to find common ground. Although Sanford and Son was clearly Foxxs vehicle, Pages Aunt Esther could hold her own against the shows star. The church-going act of Esther was a great contrast to the raunchy, expletive-filled material of Pages live act and records.

===Other film and television appearances===
In 1977, Page appeared in an episode of The Love Boat entitled "A Tasteful Affair; Oh, Dale!; The Main Event" alongside Sherman Hemsley. Page also appeared on several episodes of The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts, and over the next two decades occasionally guest-starred in episodes of other popular television shows, including Amen (TV series) Amen, Martin (TV series) Martin, 227 (TV series) 227, Family Matters, and Diffrent Strokes. She appeared on Circus Of The Stars as a fire eater. In the early 1990s she appeared on several tracks of the debut album by RuPaul entitled Supermodel of the World, most notably the hit song "Supermodel (You Better Work)." She also appeared in several music videos from the album. Shortly before her death she appeared in a series of comical Churchs Chicken television commercials featuring the catchphrase "Gotta love it!" Among her movie credits are appearances in Zapped! (1982), Good-bye, Cruel World (1983), Mausoleum (film) Mausoleum (1983), the Steve Martin film My Blue Heaven (1990 film) My Blue Heaven (1990), as an extremely foul-mouthed clown in Bobcat Goldthwaits 1991 comedy Shakes the Clown, CB4 (1993), a cameo appearance in the 1995 movie Friday (1995 film) Friday, stealing the opening scene with a one-liner, Dont Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996), and a recurring role as Ms. Porter during the first season of the 1990s television sitcom Martin (TV series) Martin.
