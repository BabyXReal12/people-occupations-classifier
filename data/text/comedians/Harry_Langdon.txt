Harry Philmore Langdon (June 15, 1884 – December 22, 1944) was an Americans American comedian who appeared in vaudeville, silent films (where he had his greatest fame), and talkies.<ref name="WVobit">Obituary Variety Obituaries Variety, December 27, 1944, page 39.</ref> 

==Life and career==
Born in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Langdon began working in medicine shows and Repertory stock companies while in his teens. In 1906, he entered vaudeville with his first wife, Rose Langdon.  By 1915, he had developed a sketch named "Johnnys New Car," on which he performed variations in the years that followed. In 1923, he joined Principal Pictures Corporation, a company headed by producer Sol Lesser. He eventually went to Keystone Studios, where he became a major star.<ref>Harter, Chuck and Michael J. Hayde; Little Elf: A Celebration of Harry Langdon (BearManor Media, 2012).</ref>  At the height of his film career, he was considered one of the four best comics of the silent film era. His screen character was that of a wide-eyed, childlike man with an innocents understanding of the world and the people in it. He was a first-class pantomimist.

Most of Langdons 1920s work was produced at the famous Mack Sennett studio. His screen character was so unique and his antics so different from the broad Sennett slapstick that he soon had a following. Success led him into feature films, directed by Arthur Ripley and Frank Capra. With such directors guiding him, Langdons work rivaled that of Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Buster Keaton. Many consider his best films to be The Strong Man (1926 in film 1926), Tramp, Tramp, Tramp (1926), and Long Pants (1927). Langdon acted as producer on these features, which were made for his own company, The Harry Langdon Corporation, and released by First National.  After his initial success, he fired Frank Capra and directed his own films, including "Threes a Crowd", "The Chaser",  and "Heart Trouble", but his appeal faded.  These films were more personal and idiosyncratic, and audiences of the period were not interested.  Capra later claimed that Langdons decline stemmed from the fact that, unlike the other great silent comics, he never fully understood what made his own film character successful.<ref>Katz, Ephraim. The Film Encyclopedia. (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Publishers) 689.</ref> However, Langdons biographer Bill Schelly, among others, have expressed skepticism about this claim, arguing that Langdon had established his character in vaudeville long before he entered movies, added by the fact that he wrote most of his own material during his stage years. History shows that Langdons greatest success was while being directed by Capra, and once he took hold of his own destiny, his original film comedy persona dropped sharply in popularity with audiences. This is likely not due to Langdons material, which he had always written himself, but due to his inexperience with the many fine points of directing, at which Capra excelled, but at which Langdon was a novice. On the other hand, a look at Langdons filmography shows that Capra directed only two of Langdons 30 silent comedies. His last silent film, and the last one Langdon directed, "Heart Trouble",  is a "lost film", so it is difficult to assess whether he might have begun achieving a greater understanding of the directorial process with more experience. The coming of sound, and the drastic changes in cinema, also thwarted Langdons chances of evolving as a director and perhaps defining a style that might have enjoyed greater box office success.

Langdons babyish character did not adapt well to sound films; as producer Hal Roach remarked, "He was not so funny articulate" (he featured Langdon in several unsuccessful sound shorts in 1929-1930). But Langdon was a big enough name to command leads in short subjects for Educational Pictures and Columbia Pictures.<ref name=okuda/> In 1938, he adopted a Caspar Milquetoast-type, henpecked-husband character that served him well. Langdon continued to work steadily in low-budget features and shorts into the 1940s, playing mild-mannered goofs. He also contributed to comedy scripts as a writer, notably for Laurel and Hardy, which led to him being paired with Oliver Hardy in a 1939 film titled Zenobia (film) Zenobia during a period when Stan Laurel was in a bitter contract dispute with Roach.<ref>Katz, Ephraim.

Langdon was considered to be the live-action role model for Seven Dwarfs#Disney Dwarfs  Dopey in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film) Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but Walt Disney rejected the idea. Eddie Collins (actor) Eddie Collins played the role instead.<ref>Barrier, Michael (2003). Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN  978-0195167290}}.

==Death==
Harry Langdon kept busy in pictures and completed his final Columbia short Pistol Packin Nitwits only weeks before his death of a cerebral hemorrhage on December 22, 1944.<ref name=okuda/> All funeral arrangements were handled by onscreen cohort and friend Vernon Dent. Langdon was interred in the Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery (Glendale, California) at the West Mausoleum located to the left of the main entrance.<ref name=okuda>Okuda, Ted and Watz, Edward; (1986). The Columbia Comedy Shorts, pp. 115-123, 221-222, McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. {{ISBN 0-89950-181-8}}</ref>

At the height of his career, Langdon was making $7,500 per week, a fortune for the times. Upon his death, The New York Times wrote, "His whole appeal was a consummate ability to look inexpressibly forlorn when confronted with manifold misfortunes—usually of the domestic type. He was what was known as dead-pan...the feeble smile and owlish blink which had become his stock-in-trade caught on in a big way, and he skyrocketed to fame and fortune..."<ref>The New York Times, Obituary, December 23, 1944.</ref>

In 1997, his hometown of Council Bluffs celebrated "Harry Langdon Day" and in 1999 named Harry Langdon Boulevard in his honor. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Harry Langdon has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6925 Hollywood Boulevard.
