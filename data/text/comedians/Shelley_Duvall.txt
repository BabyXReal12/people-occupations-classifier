==Early life==
{{expand section date=August 2014}}

Shelley Alexis Duvall was born on July 7, 1949, in Houston, Texas,<ref name=bio/> the daughter of Bobbie Ruth Crawford and Robert Richardson "Bobby" Duvall (1919–1995), a lawyer (not to be confused with actor Robert Duvall, to whom Shelley is not related).<ref>{{cite web title=Robert Richardson Duvall url=http://records.ancestry.com/robert_richardson_duvall_records.ashx?pid=68766162 publisher=ancestry.com accessdate=6 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news  last1=Kleiner  first1=Dick  authorlink1=Dick Kleiner  title=Ask Dick  url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22852077/  work=Santa Maria Times  date=July 12, 1992  location=Santa Maria, California  page=C2 via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}}</ref> Duvall has three brothers: Scott, Shane, and Stewart.<ref>{{cite news last=Klemesrud first=Judy title=Shelley Duvall, An Unlikely Star url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1977/03/23/75054966.pdf accessdate=15 April 2014 newspaper=New York Times date=March 23, 1977}}</ref>

After high school, Duvall sold cosmetics at Foleys and attended South Texas Junior College, where she majored in nutrition and diet therapy.<ref name=bio>{{cite web url=https://www.biography.com/people/shelley-duvall-20902851 work=Biography.com title=Shelley Duvall publisher=The Biography Channel accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref>

==Career==
She met Robert Altman when he was shooting Brewster McCloud (1970) on location. He offered Duvall a part in the film. She said, "I got tired of arguing, and thought maybe I am an actress. They told me to come. I simply got on a plane and did it. I was swept away."<ref name="howdid" /> Duvall had never left Texas before Altman offered her a film role. She flew to Hollywood and landed the role of a free-spirited love interest to Bud Corts reclusive Brewster in Brewster McCloud.<ref name="howdid" /><ref>{{cite news last=Dingus first=Anne title=What Part Did Shelley Duvall Beat Out Gilda Radner For? url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/content/shelley-duvall accessdate=25 May 2014 newspaper=Texas Monthly date=July 1999}}</ref>

===1970s===
Altman chose Duvall for roles as an unsatisfied mail-order bride in McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971), the daughter of a convict and mistress to Keith Carradines character in Thieves Like Us (film) Thieves Like Us (1974), a spaced-out groupie in Nashville (film) Nashville (1975), and a sympathetic Wild West woman in Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bulls History Lesson (1976).

The same year, Duvall left Altman to star as Bernice, a wealthy girl from Wisconsin in PBS’s adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s short story Bernice Bobs Her Hair. She also hosted an evening of Saturday Night Live and appeared in 5 sketches: "Programming Change," "Video Vixens," "Night of the Moonies," "Van Arguments" and "Goodnights."<ref>{{cite web title=Season 2: Episode 21 url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/76/76u.phtml publisher=Saturday Night Live Transcripts accessdate=12 April 2014}}</ref>

In 1977, Duvall starred as Mildred "Millie" Lammoreaux in Altmans 3 Women. Duvalls performance garnered the award for Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress Best Actress at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association LAFCA Award for Best Actress, as well as a BAFTA nomination.<ref>{{cite web work=BAFTA Awards title=BAFTA Awards Search: 1978 Film Actress accessdate=13 September 2017 url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1978/film/actress}}</ref> She appeared in a minor role in Woody Allens Annie Hall (1977).<ref name="imdbawards">{{cite web title=Shelley Duvall – Awards url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001167/awards publisher=imdb.com accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref>

===1980s===
Duvalls next role was Wendy Torrance in The Shining (film) The Shining (1980) directed by Stanley Kubrick. Jack Nicholson states in the documentary Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures that Kubrick was great to work with but that he was "a different director" with Duvall. Because of Kubricks methodical nature, principal photography took a year to complete. Kubrick and Duvall argued frequently, although Duvall later said she learned more from working with Kubrick on The Shining than she did on all her earlier films.<ref>{{YouTube Y3XT5jC19e0}}{{dead link date=February 2012}}</ref> In order to give The Shining the psychological horror it needed, director Stanley Kubrick antagonized his actors. The film’s script was changed so often that Nicholson stopped reading each draft. Kubrick intentionally isolated Duvall and argued with her often. Duvall was forced to perform the iconic and exhausting baseball bat scene 127 times. Afterwards, Duvall presented Kubrick with clumps of hair that had fallen out due to the extreme stress of filming.<ref>"Roles that Drove Actors Over the Edge," Shelly Duvall: The Shining, http://www.looper.com/1970/roles-drove-actors-edge/ Accessed 3 November 2015.</ref>

While Duvall was in London shooting The Shining, Altman asked her to play Olive Oyl in his big-screen adaptation of Popeye (film) Popeye opposite Robin Williams, a role Roger Ebert believes she was born to play:
{{quote Shelley Duvall is like a precious piece of china with a tinkling personality. She looks and sounds like almost nobody else, and if it is true that she was born to play the character Olive Oyl (and does so in Altmans new musical Popeye), it is also true that she has possibly played more really different kinds of characters than almost any other young actress of the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news last=Ebert first=Roger title=Shelley Duvall Was Ripe for Role of Olive url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19810104&id=JlQ0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=6mcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5578,2176306 accessdate=13 April 2014 newspaper=N.Y. Times Wire Service date=4 January 1981}}</ref>}}

Her role of Pansy in Terry Gilliams Time Bandits (1981) followed. In 1982, Duvall narrated, hosted and was executive producer of the childrens television program Faerie Tale Theatre. She starred in seven episodes of the series; "Rumpelstiltskin" (1983), "Rapunzel" (1983), "The Nightingale (fairy tale) The Nightingale" (1983), "Snow White Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1984), "Puss in Boots" (1985), and "Aladdin Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp" (1986). Since the programs first episode "The Tale of the Frog Prince (Faerie Tale Theatre episode) The Frog Prince", which starred Robin Williams and Teri Garr, Duvall produced 27 hour-long episodes of the program. In 1985, she created Tall Tales & Legends, another one-hour anthology series for Showtime (TV network) Showtime, which featured adaptations of American folk tales. As with Faerie Tale Theatre, the series starred well-known Hollywood actors with Duvall as host, executive producer, and occasional guest star. The series ran for nine episodes and garnered Duvall an Emmy nomination.<ref name="imdbawards" />

While Duvall was producing Fairy Tale Theatre, it was reported that she was to star as the lead in the film adaptation of Tom Robbins’s Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film) Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, which starred Mick Jagger, Jerry Hall, her sister Cindy Hall and Sissy Spacek.<ref>{{cite news last=Wilson first=Earl title=Its Thumbs Up for Shelley Duvall url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&dat=19811125&id=GIFQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GRIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7087,4563573 accessdate=13 April 2014 newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel date=November 25, 1981}}</ref> The project was delayed and when it released in 1993 it starred an entirely different cast.<ref>{{cite web title=Even Cowgirls Get the Blues url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106834/ publisher=IMDB.com accessdate=29 May 2014}}</ref> She also landed roles in films and television series: the mother of a boy whose dog is struck by car in Tim Burtons short film Frankenweenie (1984 film) Frankenweenie (1984), a lonely and timid woman who receives a message from a flying saucer in The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series) The Twilight Zone episode "The Once and Future King/A Saucer of Loneliness", and the friend of Steve Martins character in the comedy Roxanne (film) Roxanne (1987).

In 1988, Duvall founded a new production company called Think Entertainment to develop programs and television movies for cable channels. She created Nightmare Classics (1989), a third Showtime anthology series that featured adaptations of well-known horror stories by authors including Edgar Allan Poe. Unlike the previous two series, Nightmare Classics was aimed at a teenage and adult audience. It was the least successful series that Duvall produced for Showtime and ran for only four episodes.<ref>{{cite news last1=Nanwalt first1=Sasha title=Television; Shelley Duvall Tries Scaring Up A New Audience url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/arts/television-shelley-duvall-tries-scaring-up-a-new-audience.html accessdate=4 June 2014 publisher=New York Times date=6 August 1989}}</ref>

The following year, Think Entertainment joined the newly formed Universal Family Entertainment to create Duvalls fourth Showtime original series, Shelley Duvalls Bedtime Stories, which featured animated adaptations of childrens storybooks with celebrity narrators and garnered her a second Emmy nomination. Duvall produced a fifth series for Showtime, Mrs. Piggle Wiggle, before selling Think Entertainment in 1993 and retiring as a producer. Duvalls production work gained her six CableACE Awards and one Peabody Award.<ref name="imdbawards" /> A year later, Duvall landed a guest spot on the television series L.A. Law as Margo Stanton, a show dog owner and breeder who presses charges against the owner of a Welsh Corgi that mated with her prize-winning Afghan Hound.<ref>{{cite web title=LA Law Season 8 Episode 19 :: "Tunnel of Love" url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqWNFEiViXc website=Youtube.com publisher=Youtube.com accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref>

She appeared as the vain, over-friendly, but harmless Countess Gemini{{mdash}}sister to the calculating Gilbert Osmond (John Malkovich){{mdash}}in Jane Campions 1996 adaptation of the Henry James novel The Portrait of a Lady (film) The Portrait of a Lady. A year later, she played a beatific nun in the comedy film Changing Habits and a besotted, murderous, ostrich-farm owner in Guy Maddins fourth feature Twilight of the Ice Nymphs.

Near the end of the decade, she returned to the horror genre with Tale of the Mummy (1998) and The 4th Floor (1999 film) The 4th Floor (1999).<ref>{{cite web title=Shelley Duval url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001167/ website=IMDB.com publisher=IMDB.com accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref>

===2000s===
In the 2000s, Duvall accepted minor roles, including the mother of Matthew Lawrences character in the horror-comedy Boltneck and Haylie Duffs aunt in the independent family film Dreams in the Attic, which was sold to the Disney Channel but was never released.<ref>{{Cite web   title = Actress Haylie Duff - The Beginning   author = Bro Bob   work = haileyduff.com   date =   accessdate = 2016-10-03   url = http://www.haileyduff.com/reflect.htm   language =   quote = ...&nbsp;the sad thing was that all these efforts never resulted in the film being sold to anyone.}}</ref> Her most recent acting appearance was a small role in the 2002 independent film Manna from Heaven (film) Manna from Heaven.
