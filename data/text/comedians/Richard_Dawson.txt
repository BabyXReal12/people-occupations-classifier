In 1975, during his tenure as one of Match Game{{s}} regular panelists, Dawson was hired by Goodson to host another game show titled Family Feud, which debuted on 12 July 1976 on American Broadcasting Company ABCs daytime schedule.

One of Dawsons trademarks on Family Feud, kissing the female contestants, earned him the nickname The Kissing Bandit. Television executives repeatedly tried to get him to stop the kissing.<ref name="NYT"/> After receiving criticism for the practice, he asked viewers to write in and vote on the matter. The mail response was 704 against and 14,600 in favor.<ref>{{cite book last1=Royce first1=Brenda Scott title=Hogans Heroes: The Unofficial Companion date=1998 publisher=Renaissance Books location=Los Angeles isbn=978-1-58063-031-3  page= 103  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SUKAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA103&dq=kiss%20richard%20dawson&pg=PA103#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> On the 1985 finale, Dawson explained that he kissed contestants for love and luck, something his mother did with Dawson himself as a child.<ref name="CNN"/><ref name="Time">{{cite web url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/06/03/family-feud-tv-host-richard-dawson-dies-at-79 title=Family Feud TV Host Richard Dawson Dies at 79 work=Time (magazine) Time date=3 June 2012 accessdate=13 January 2016 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609092332/http://entertainment.time.com/2012/06/03/family-feud-tv-host-richard-dawson-dies-at-79/ archivedate=9 June 2012 df=dmy-all}}</ref> Some viewers complained when he kissed the cheeks of non-white women, but in a 2010 interview he defended his actions, saying that "Its very important to me that on Family Feud I could kiss all people...

===Later years===
Dawson parodied his TV persona in 1987s The Running Man (1987 film) The Running Man, in which he portrayed the evil, egotistical game-show host Damon Killian and received rave reviews for his performance. Film critic Roger Ebert (who gave the film a thumbs down) wrote, "Playing a character who always seems three-quarters drunk, he chain-smokes his way through backstage planning sessions and then pops up in front of the cameras as a cauldron of false jollity. Working the audience, milking the laughs and the tears, he is not really much different than most genuine game show hosts – and thats the films private joke."<ref>{{cite news  first= Roger  last= Ebert  url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19871113/REVIEWS/711130304/1023  title= The Running Man review  website=   newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times  date= 13 November 1987}}</ref>

Dawson hosted an unsold pilot for a revival of the classic game show You Bet Your Life that was to air on NBC in 1988, but the network declined to pick up the show, which attempted two more failed revivals with hosts Buddy Hackett and Bill Cosby. In 1990, he auditioned to host the syndicated game show Trump Card (game show) Trump Card, but that role went to Jimmy Cefalo. On 12 September 1994, Dawson returned to the syndicated edition of Family Feud, replacing and succeeding Ray Combs. Combs was previously fired, because the shows ratings were spiraling downward. Dawson finished out for what became the final season of the shows official second run (1988–95). Still, ratings for the show were not in good standing, and Family Feud was out of production for the next four years. In 1999, Family Feud was back in action, and ever since, it has been having continuous production with hosts Louie Anderson (1999–2002), Richard Karn (2002–2006), John OHurley (2006–2010) and Steve Harvey (2010–present).

Upon Dawsons return, he received a standing ovation after he walked on the set. Afterwards he said, "If you do too much of that, I wont be able to do a show for you because Ill cry." During the revival, he did not kiss the female contestants because of a promise hed made to his young daughter to kiss only her mother. The final episode aired on 26 May 1995, and then Dawson officially retired. In 1999, he was asked to make a special appearance on the first episode of the current version of Family Feud, but decided to turn down the offer and have no further involvement with the show.<ref name="THS">E!
