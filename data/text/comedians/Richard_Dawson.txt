During Dawsons time on Match Game, he occupied the bottom center seat of the panel.

In 1975, during his tenure as one of Match Game{{s}} regular panelists, Dawson was hired by Goodson to host another game show titled Family Feud, which debuted on 12 July 1976 on American Broadcasting Company ABCs daytime schedule. Family Feud was a break-out hit, eventually surpassing the ratings of Match Game in late 1977. In 1978, he left Match Game and won a Daytime Emmy Award for Best Game Show Host for his work on Family Feud.
One of Dawsons trademarks on Family Feud, kissing the female contestants, earned him the nickname The Kissing Bandit. Television executives repeatedly tried to get him to stop the kissing.
After receiving criticism for the practice, he asked viewers to write in and vote on the matter. The mail response was 704 against and 14,600 in favor.
On the 1985 finale, Dawson explained that he kissed contestants for love and luck, something his mother did with Dawson himself as a child.
Some viewers complained when he kissed the cheeks of non-white women, but in a 2010 interview he defended his actions, saying that "Its very important to me that on Family Feud I could kiss all people... I kissed black women daily and nightly on Family Feud for 11 years, and the world didn’t come to an end, did it?"
After his first stint with Family Feud expired, Dawson was succeeded by Ray Combs.

In 1983, Dawson made an appearance on Mamas Family as himself, hosting an episode of Family Feud where the Harpers play as contestants (reuniting him with former Match Game co-panelists Betty White and Vicki Lawrence).
===Later years===
Dawson parodied his TV persona in 1987s The Running Man (1987 film) The Running Man, in which he portrayed the evil, egotistical game-show host Damon Killian and received rave reviews for his performance. Film critic Roger Ebert (who gave the film a thumbs down) wrote, "Playing a character who always seems three-quarters drunk, he chain-smokes his way through backstage planning sessions and then pops up in front of the cameras as a cauldron of false jollity. Working the audience, milking the laughs and the tears, he is not really much different than most genuine game show hosts – and thats the films private joke."
Dawson hosted an unsold pilot for a revival of the classic game show You Bet Your Life that was to air on NBC in 1988, but the network declined to pick up the show, which attempted two more failed revivals with hosts Buddy Hackett and Bill Cosby. In 1990, he auditioned to host the syndicated game show Trump Card (game show) Trump Card, but that role went to Jimmy Cefalo. On 12 September 1994, Dawson returned to the syndicated edition of Family Feud, replacing and succeeding Ray Combs. Combs was previously fired, because the shows ratings were spiraling downward. Dawson finished out for what became the final season of the shows official second run (1988–95). Still, ratings for the show were not in good standing, and Family Feud was out of production for the next four years. In 1999, Family Feud was back in action, and ever since, it has been having continuous production with hosts Louie Anderson (1999–2002), Richard Karn (2002–2006), John OHurley (2006–2010) and Steve Harvey (2010–present).

Upon Dawsons return, he received a standing ovation after he walked on the set. Afterwards he said, "If you do too much of that, I wont be able to do a show for you because Ill cry." During the revival, he did not kiss the female contestants because of a promise hed made to his young daughter to kiss only her mother. The final episode aired on 26 May 1995, and then Dawson officially retired. In 1999, he was asked to make a special appearance on the first episode of the current version of Family Feud, but decided to turn down the offer and have no further involvement with the show.
In 2000, Dawson narrated TVs Funniest Game Show Moments on the Fox network.

==Personal life and family==

He met his second wife, Gretchen Johnson (born 22 September 1955), when she was a contestant on Family Feud in May 1981; they married in 1991. A daughter, Shannon Nicole Dawson, was born in 1990. Dawson announced the birth and showed a picture of his daughter during his inaugural episode of Feud in 1994 as he was greeting a contestant who had been a contestant on Match Game when he was a panelist. The episode was featured on the 25th anniversary of Family Feud as no. 14 on the Game Show Networks top 25 Feud Moments.{{Citation needed date=November 2013}}
