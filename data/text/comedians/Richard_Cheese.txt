Richard Cheese & Lounge Against The Machine is a cover band and comedy comedy act, performing popular songs in a lounge music lounge/swing style, reminiscent of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Tony Bennett. Lounge singer Richard Cheese is a character created and portrayed by Los Angeles-based actor/comedian Mark Jonathan Davis.

==History==
Davis developed the Richard Cheese lounge singer idea in the mid-1990s while working as a producer at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles.  Davis portrayed a character named "Paul The 55-Year-Old Intern" on the Kevin and Bean morning show, and Paul recorded a single called "Paul On 45," which was a humorous medley of KROQ songs arranged in a swing/big band style.

Davis pitched this idea as an album concept, and the bands debut album Richard Cheese: Lounge Against the Machine ("Featuring 16 Swingin Covers Of Alternative Standards") was released in 2000 by Oglio Records.<ref>{{cite book last1=Turner first1=Katherine title=This is the Sound of Irony: Music, Politics and Popular Culture date=March 3, 2016 publisher=Routledge isbn=9781317010548 page=171 url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ReCqCwAAQBAJ accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref> Since 2000, Daviss Richard Cheese & Lounge Against The Machine band has released twenty albums.

Cheeses second and third albums Tuxicity and Id Like A Virgin were independently released in 2002 and 2004 by Cheeses own label, Ideatown Entertainment (later renamed to Coverage Records).

From 2004-2006, Surfdog Records released three new Richard Cheese CDs: Aperitif for Destruction, The Sunny Side of the Moon: The Best of Richard Cheese, and Silent Nightclub.  Surfdog also re-released Tuxicity and Id Like A Virgin on their label in 2006.

Beginning in 2007, Cheese returned to releasing his own albums through his independent Coverage Records label, about one each year:  Dick at Nite, Viva La Vodka: Richard Cheese Live, OK Bartender, A Lounge Supreme, Live At The Royal Wedding and its companion behind-the-scenes album The Royal Baby Album, Back In Black Tie, and a Christmas album, Cocktails With Santa.

Cheese also produced an album in 2010 as "Johnny Aloha" called Lavapalooza, with a band of Hawaiian music musicians performing tiki-style versions of rock and rap songs.  The album cover artwork was created by the artist Shag (artist) Shag.

In late 2015, Cheese released 3 new CDs:  a live album titled Bakin At The Boulder, a Star Wars tribute called The Lounge Awakens: Richard Cheese & Lounge Against The Machine Live At The Mos Eisley Spaceport Cantina, and a new studio album Supermassive Black Tux.  In 2016, because Richard Cheese sang two songs in the motion picture Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the band released a one-track parody album called Richard Cheese: Live At Wayne Financial Tower in which the bands performance is cut short by Supermans heat vision.

The Richard Cheese & Lounge Against The Machine band released a new studio album on CD titled "Licensed To Spill" on October 16, 2017, and a greatest hits digital compilation titled "Lord Of The Swings: The Best Of Richard Cheese, Volume 2" on February 3, 2018.  A career retrospective boxed set titled "Grateful: 21 Years Of Richard Cheese & Lounge Against The Machine 2000-2020" is scheduled for release in 2020.

The Richard Cheese & Lounge Against The Machine band has toured extensively around the United States and has performed shows in England, Portugal, The Bahamas, and Canada.
