Peters is widely known for his punchline, "Somebody gonna get a hurt real bad." It ends a joke he tells about his childhood with a traditional Indian father, who used corporal punishment on his sons. Another punchline he uses is "Be a man! Do the right thing!", which relates to a story of a Chinese man trying to get him to pay more for an item at a shop.<ref>{{cite news last=Nguyen first=An title=Defying Stereotypes and Breaking All Laws of Decency, Russell Peters Lets It All Hang Out url=http://culturemagazine.ca/culture/defying_stereotypes_and_breaking_all_laws_of_decency_russell_peters_lets_it_all_hang_out.html accessdate=29 January 2012 newspaper=(Cult)ure magazine date=19 May 2009 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115223351/http://culturemagazine.ca/culture/defying_stereotypes_and_breaking_all_laws_of_decency_russell_peters_lets_it_all_hang_out.html archivedate=15 November 2011 df=}}</ref>
