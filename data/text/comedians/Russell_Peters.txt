==Early life==
Peters was born in Toronto, Ontario to Eric and Maureen Peters. When he was four, the family moved to the suburb of Brampton. His older brother Clayton now serves as his manager.
Peters was raised Catholic and is of Anglo-Indian descent.
His late father was born in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India and worked in Toronto as a federal meat inspector; Peters regularly features stories about him in his comedy work.

Peters attended Chinguacousy Secondary School for grades 9–10, and Judith Nyman Secondary School North Peel Secondary School in Bramalea, Ontario Bramalea for grades 11–12.
In school, he was regularly bullied racism because of his ethnicity. He eventually learned boxing, which helped him resist the bullying.
Peters also became a hip hop music hip hop "junkie" in his youth. By the 1990s, he was a well-connected disc jockey in the Toronto scene.
==Career==
Peters began performing in Toronto in 1989. He has since gone on to perform in several countries worldwide.
In 1992, Peters met American comedian George Carlin, one of his biggest influences, who advised him to get on stage whenever and wherever possible. Peters said he "took that advice to heart, and I think thats the reason I am where I am now."
In 2007, 15 years later, he hosted one of Carlins last shows before Carlins death the following year.
Peters credits his 2004 performance on the Canadian TV comedy show Comedy Now!, which was uploaded onto YouTube and became viral video viral, as the turning point in his career. While the initial video upload featured his entire 45-minute performance, YouTube users subsequently uploaded segments of the performance in which Peters focused on individual cultural groups. According to Peters, those segments made their way to the "targeted" cultural groups and were well received by them. The video and its viral nature was referred to by Peters on his performance, Outsourced; when the audience cheered when he referred to earlier jokes, he exclaimed, "Look at you, you filthy downloaders!"
In 2017, Peters made an appearance on Top Gear America in the third episode of Season 1 as one of the guests.

Peters hosted the Canada Day Comedy Festival 2006, and participated in a USO tour of Iraq, Afghanistan, Germany, Africa and Greenland in November 2007 with Wilmer Valderrama and Mayra Veronica.
He also produced and starred in the radio comedy radio situation comedy series Monsoon House on CBC Radio One.

===Earnings===

In 2013, he earned $21 million, according to Forbes{{}} estimate.
==Comedic style==
Peterss stand-up performances feature observational comedy, using humour to highlight racial, ethnic, class and cultural stereotypes. He often refers to his own experiences growing up in an Anglo-Indian family, and impersonates the accents of various ethnic groups to poke fun at them. As he told an audience in San Francisco, "I dont make the stereotypes, I just see them."
In a 2006 interview with The National (CBC) The National, Peters observed that he did not intend to put down or offend different races and cultures, but tried to "raise them up through humour".
Peters is widely known for his punchline, "Somebody gonna get a hurt real bad." It ends a joke he tells about his childhood with a traditional Indian father, who used corporal punishment on his sons. Another punchline he uses is "Be a man! Do the right thing!", which relates to a story of a Chinese man trying to get him to pay more for an item at a shop.
When interviewer Larry King asked Peters, "Is there such a thing as too taboo?", Peters replied, "I dont talk about religion because I think people are a little weird about religion, especially nowadays, and Im more of a science guy than I am a beliefs guy. Im more into facts than I am into beliefs."
In an interview with Al Jazeera, Peters said he "refuses" to talk about religion.
