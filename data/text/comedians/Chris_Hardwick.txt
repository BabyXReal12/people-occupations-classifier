Hardwick has denied Dykstras allegations, saying, "Our three year relationship was not perfect—we were ultimately not a good match and argued—even shouted at each other—but I loved her, and did my best to uplift and support her as a partner and companion in any way and at no time did I sexually assault her."<ref>{{cite website first=Matt last=Wilstein url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/chris-hardwick-denies-sexually-assaulting-ex-girlfriend-chloe-dykstra title=Chris Hardwick Denies Sexually Assaulting Ex-Girlfriend Chloe Dykstra website=The Daily Beast publisher=IAC/Newsweek Media Group location=New York City date=June 16, 2018 accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chris-hardwick-denies-claims-he-sexually-assaulted-chloe-dykstra-1120718 title=Chris Hardwick Denies Claims That He Sexually Assaulted Chloe Dykstra magazine=The Hollywood Reporter publisher=Eldridge Industries location=Los Angeles, California date=June 15, 2018 accessdate=June 16, 2018}}</ref> Three former girlfriends<ref>{{cite news first=Peter last=Sblendorio url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/ny-ent-chris-hardwick-former-girlfriends-defend-20180627-story.html title=Three of Chris Hardwicks exes defend him amid abuse allegations newspaper=New York Daily News publisher=Tronc location=New York City date=June 27, 2018 accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news first=Christie last=DZurillo url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-2018-janet-varney-chris-hardwick-s-1530041954-htmlstory.html title=Janet Varney, Chris Hardwicks ex-girlfriend, says he never abused her newspaper=Los Angeles Times publisher=Tronc location=Los Angeles, California date=June 26, 2018 accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref> and his wife<ref>{{cite web first=Renaldo last=Matadeen url=https://www.cbr.com/chris-hardwick-wife-sexual-assault-allegations/ title=Chris Hardwicks Wife Defends Him Against Sexual Assault Allegations website=Comic Book Resources publisher=Valnet, Inc. location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada date=June 21, 2018 accessdate=July 13, 2018}}</ref> all say that Hardwick has never been abusive with them.

On July 25, AMC announced Hardwick would return as host of Talking Dead and Talking with Chris Hardwick after an investigation was completed by AMC and with the assistance of a law firm, the company found that reinstating Hardwicks show was "the appropriate step".<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/25/entertainment/chris-hardwick-talking-dead/index.html title=Chris Hardwick returning as host of Talking Dead following investigation last=Gonzalez first=Sandra work=CNN date=July 25, 2018 accessdate=July 26, 2018}}</ref> Two days later, Dykstra stated on Twitter that she "chose not to participate in the investigation of the person I spoke of.
