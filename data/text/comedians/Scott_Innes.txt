Scott Innes (born October 1, 1966) is an United States American voice actor, author, songwriter and radio personality.

==Life and career==
Innes became the voice of Scooby-Doo (character) Scooby-Doo between 1998 and 2002 after Don Messicks death in 1997. From 1999 to 2002, he was also the voice of Scoobys best friend and owner Shaggy Rogers Norville "Shaggy" Rogers. He was replaced by Frank Welker (as Scooby) and by Casey Kasem (as Shaggy) in 2002, although Innes still provided the voices in video game projects and some commercials until 2009. He also voiced Scoobys nephew Scrappy-Doo in the live action movie Scooby-Doo (film) Scooby-Doo (2002).

He voiced Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble in a Toshiba commercial from 2002 and even voiced Astro from the Jetsons in a 2003 series of Radio Shack commercials. Innes auditioned to replace the retired Casey Kasem to return as Shaggy for the television series Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, but he lost the role to Matthew Lillard, who previously portrayed Shaggy in the 2002 film and its sequel Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004).

He wrote the song, "Handprints on the Wall", which was recorded by Kenny Rogers.
In-between his voice acting duties, Innes was the afternoon air personality at Country outlet WYNK-FM/Baton Rouge, Louisiana from 1997â€“
2011, and joined nearby station WZRH WRKN in the same position on April 21, 2016. Innes is currently the publisher and author of Hug magazine since 2010.
He returned to voice Shaggy Rogers and Scooby-Doo in two McDonalds commercials from 2014 and 2015 respectively, then in a 2017 Halifax Bank commercial.
