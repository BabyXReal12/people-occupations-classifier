"The OConnors lived well, at first in the Bronx, later in a larger apartment in Elmhurst, Queens, and finally in a nice single-family home in Forest Hills, Queens, then an enclave for people of means."</ref>

In 1941, Carroll OConnor enrolled at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, but dropped out when the United States entered World War II. During the war, he was rejected by the United States Navy and enrolled in the United States Merchant Marine Academy for a short time. After leaving that institution, he became a merchant seaman and served in the United States Merchant Marine during World War II.<ref name="oconnor">{{cite news url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/53347/Carroll-O-Connor title=Carroll OConnor work=The New York Times accessdate=2009-03-19 first=Kathryn last=Shattuck}}</ref>

After the war, OConnor attended the University of Montana-Missoula, where he met Nancy Fields, who later became his wife. He also worked at the Montana Kaimin#Controversy Montana Kaimin student newspaper as an editor. At the University of Montana, he joined Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity.<ref name=spe>{{cite web url=http://www.sigep.org/about/alumni_entertainment.asp  title=Sigma Phi Epsilon – Prominent Alumni  publisher=Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity  accessdate=March 21, 2010  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228184118/http://sigep.org/about/alumni_entertainment.asp  archivedate=February 28, 2009 }}</ref> OConnor did not take any drama courses as an undergraduate at the University of Montana. He later left that university to help his younger brother Hugh get into medical school in Ireland, where Carroll completed his studies at the University College Dublin and began his acting career.<ref name="YouTube"/>

After OConnors fiancée, Nancy Fields, graduated from the University of Montana in 1951 with degrees in drama and English, she sailed to Ireland to meet Carroll, who was visiting his brother, Hugh.<ref name="UMT">{{cite web title=All in the UM Family – OConnors Donate $1 Million to Center  publisher=University of Montana  url=http://www.umt.edu/urelations/MainHall/0999/family.htm  accessdate=August 7, 2011  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702005136/http://www.umt.edu/urelations/MainHall/0999/family.htm  archivedate=July 2, 2011 }}</ref> The couple married in Dublin on July 28, 1951.<ref name="FilmRef">{{cite web url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/30/Carroll-O-Connor.html title=Carroll OConnor Biography (1924–2001) publisher=FilmReference.com accessdate=September 3, 2011}}</ref> In 1956, OConnor returned to Missoula to earn a masters degree in speech.<ref name="UMT"/> OConnor said on The Dick Cavett Show, in December 1971, that the level of education that he achieved was a masters degree from the University of Montana and that he had completed a bachelors degree at the University of Dublin.

==Prolific character actor==
After acting in theatrical productions in Dublin and New York during the 1950s, OConnors breakthrough came when he was cast by director Burgess Meredith (assisted by John Astin) in a featured role in the Broadway adaptation of James Joyces novel Ulysses (novel) Ulysses. OConnor and Meredith remained close, lifelong friends.<ref>OConnor, Carroll, I Think Im Outta Here, Simon & Schuster, 1998</ref>

OConnor made his television acting debut as a character actor on two episodes of Sunday Showcase. These two parts led to other roles on such television series as The Americans (1961 TV series) The Americans, The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series) The Eleventh Hour, Gunsmoke, Bonanza, The Fugitive (TV series) The Fugitive, The Wild Wild West, Armstrong Circle Theatre, Death Valley Days, The Outer Limits (1963 TV series) The Outer Limits, The Great Adventure (U.S. TV series) The Great Adventure, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Dr. Kildare, I Spy (1965 TV series) I Spy, That Girl, Premiere and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, among many others. OConnor starred as an Eastern European villain in the first season of Mission Impossible, season one, episode 18 "The Trial". Late in his career, he appeared on several episodes of Mad About You as the father of Helen Hunts character.

===Considered roles===
He was among the actors considered for the roles of the Skipper on Gilligans Island and Dr. Smith in the TV show Lost in Space, and was the visual template in the creation of Batman foe Rupert Thorne, a character who debuted at the height of All in the Familys success in Detective Comics No. 469 (published May 1976 by DC Comics).

==Television roles==

===All in the Family===
File:All in the family october 27 1973.jpg thumb Publicity photo of OConnor and Jean Stapleton in All in the Family, 1973
OConnor was living in Italy in 1968 when producer Norman Lear first asked him to come to New York to star in a pilot he was creating for ABC called Justice For All (TV pilot) Justice For All, with OConnor playing Archie Justice, a lovable yet controversial bigot. After three pilots done between 1968 and 1970, a network change to CBS, and the last name of the character changed to Bunker, the new sitcom was renamed All in the Family. The show was based on the BBCs Till Death Us Do Part (British TV series) Till Death Us Do Part, with Bunker based on Alf Garnett, albeit somewhat less abrasive than the original. OConnors Queens background and New York accent is said to have influenced Lear to set the show in Queens.<ref name=oconnor2>{{cite news title=Carroll OConnor newspaper=New York Times url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/53347/Carroll-O-Connor/biography accessdate=September 2, 2011}}</ref>

Wanting a well-known actor to play the role, Lear had approached Jackie Gleason and Mickey Rooney to play Archie; both declined. OConnor accepted, not expecting the show to be a success and believing he would be able to move back to Europe. In her book Archie & Edith, Mike & Gloria: the Tumultuous History of All in the Family, Donna McCrohan noted that OConnor requested that Lear provide him with a return airplane ticket to Rome as a condition of his accepting the role, so he could return to Italy when the show failed. Instead, the show became the highest-rated television show on American television for five consecutive seasons until the 1976–77 season (the sixth season).

OConnors own politics were liberal. He understood the Bunker character and played him not only with bombast and humor, but also with touches of vulnerability. The writing on the show was consistently left of center, but OConnor often deftly skewered the liberal pieties of the day. Although Bunker was famous for his malapropisms of the English language, OConnor was highly educated and cultured and was an English professor{{citation needed date=March 2017}} before he turned to acting.

The show also starred a Broadway theatre Broadway actress, also from New York City, Jean Stapleton, in the role of Bunkers long-suffering wife, Edith Bunker, whom Lear remembered from seeing in the play and film Damn Yankees. The producer sent the show over to ABC twice, but it did not get picked up. They then approached CBS with more success, and accordingly, All in the Family was retooled and debuted early in 1971. The show also starred unknown character actors, such as Rob Reiner as Archies liberal son-in-law, Michael "Meathead" Stivic, and Sally Struthers as Archie and Ediths only child and Mikes wife, Gloria. The cast had a unique on- and off-camera chemistry, especially Reiner, who became OConnors best friend and favorite actor.

CBS was unsure whether the controversial subject matter of All in the Family would fit well into a sitcom. Race (classification of human beings) Racial issues, ethnicities, religions, class, education, womens equality, gun control, politics, inflation, the Vietnam war, energy crisis, Watergate and other timely topics of the 1970s were addressed. Like its British predecessor Till Death Us Do Part, the show lent dramatic social substance to the traditional sitcom format. Archie Bunkers popularity made OConnor a top-billing star of the 1970s. OConnor was afraid of being typecast (acting) typecast for playing the role, but at the same time, he was protective of not just his character, but of the entire show, too.{{citation needed date=December 2017}}

A contract dispute between OConnor and Lear marred the beginning of the shows fifth season. Eventually, OConnor got a raise and appeared in the series until it ended. For his work as Archie Bunker, he was nominated for eight Emmy Awards as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series; he won the award four times (1972, 1977, 1978 and 1979).

At the end of the eighth season in 1978, Reiner and Struthers left the series to pursue other projects, but OConnor and Stapleton still had one year left on their contracts.

Rob Reiner said in a 2014 interview about his on- and off-screen chemistry with OConnor, "We did over 200 shows in front of a live audience. So I learned a lot about what audiences like, what they dont like, how stories are structured. I would spend a lot of time in the writing room and I actually wrote some scripts. And from Carroll OConnor I learned a lot about how you perform and how important the script and story are for the actors. So the actor doesnt have to push things. You can let the story and the dialogue support you if its good. I had great people around me and I took from all the people who were around." He also stated, when he compared Carroll OConnors character to his acting mentors real-life persona: "Carroll OConnor brought his humanity to the character even though he had these abhorrent views. Hes still a feeling, human being. He loved his wife even though he acted the way he did, and he loved his daughter. Those things come out. I dont think anybodys all good or all bad."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nell-minow/rob-reiner-on-the-middlea_b_5540654.html title=Rob Reiner on the Middle-Age Love Story And So It Goes work=The Huffington Post}}</ref>

===Archie Bunkers Place===
{{main Archie Bunkers Place}}
When All in the Family ended after nine seasons, Archie Bunkers Place continued in its place and ran for four more years. Longtime friend and original series star Jean Stapleton kept her role as Edith Bunker, but was limited to about a half dozen guest appearances in season one. In the second-season premiere, her character died of a stroke, leaving Archie to cope with the loss. The show was cancelled in 1983. OConnor was angered{{citation needed date=February 2013}} about the shows cancellation, maintaining that the show ended with an inappropriate finale. He vowed never to work in any type of show with CBS again,{{citation needed date=February 2013}} although he starred in In the Heat of the Night, which aired on CBS in that shows last three seasons.

===In the Heat of the Night===
{{main In the Heat of the Night (TV series)}}
While coping with his sons drug problem, OConnor starred as Sparta, Mississippi, Police Chief Bill Gillespie, a tough veteran cop on In the Heat of the Night. Based on the In the Heat of the Night (film) 1967 movie of the same name, the series debuted on NBC in March 1988 and performed well. He cast his son Hugh OConnor as Officer Lonnie Jamison. The headquarters of the Sparta Police Department was actually the library in Covington, Georgia.

Much like OConnor himself, Gillespie was racially progressive and politically liberal, but the character of Bill Gillespie was also a smart and tough police officer who was not afraid to use his gun when the occasion called for it.

In 1989, while working on the set, OConnor was hospitalized and had to undergo open heart surgery, which caused him to miss four episodes at the end of the second season (actor Joe Don Baker took his place in those episodes as an acting police chief.) OConnor would later serve as one of the executive producers for the series, starting with the third season. The series was transferred from NBC to CBS in 1992 and cancelled two years later after its seventh season. OConnor reprised his role the following year for four two-hour In the Heat of the Night television films to critical acclaim.{{Citation needed date=November 2010}}

While on the series, OConnor recorded "Bring a Torch, Jeanette Isabella" for the 1991 In the Heat of the Night Christmas CD Christmas Times A Comin. He was joined by Grand Ole Opry star mandolinist Jesse McReynolds, Nashville accordionist Abe Manuel, Jr., and Nashville fiddlers Buddy Spicher and Randall Franks. CD Producer and series co-star Randall Franks created the arrangement which was co-produced by series co-star Alan Autry. He joined other members of the cast for a recording of "Jingle Bells" with vocals by Country Music Hall of Fame members Little Jimmy Dickens, Kitty Wells, Pee Wee King, the Marksmen Quartet, Bobby Wright, Johnnie Wright and Ken Holloway.

In July 1991, OConnor, Jean Stapleton, Reiner, and Sally Struthers were reunited to celebrate the 20th anniversary of All in the Family. Due to reruns which aired in Television syndication syndication, TV Land, Antenna TV, and CBS, the show continued to be popular.

In March 2000, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was given a St. Patricks Day tribute by MGM.

==Personal life==
In 1962, while he was in Rome filming Cleopatra (1963 film) Cleopatra, OConnor and his wife adopted a six-day-old boy, naming him Hugh OConnor Hugh after OConnors brother who had died a year earlier. At age 17, Hugh worked as a courier on the set of Archie Bunkers Place. OConnor eventually created the role of Officer Lonnie Jamison on In the Heat of the Night for his son.

In 1989, Carroll was admitted to the hospital for heart bypass surgery.<ref>{{Cite .news url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/03/20/Carroll-OConnor-has-gall-bladder-removed/4938606373200/ title=Carroll OConnor has gall bladder removed date=March 20, 1989 work=UPI access-date=January 2, 2018 language=en}}</ref>

On March 28, 1995, OConnors adopted son Hugh committed suicide after a long battle with drug addiction.<ref>{{Cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/30/us/carroll-o-connor-s-son-kills-himself-at-33.html title=Carroll OConnors Son Kills Himself at 33 date=March 30, 1995 work=The New York Times access-date=January 2, 2018 language=en-US issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Following his sons death, OConnor appeared in public service announcements for Partnership for a Drug Free America and spent the rest of his life working to raise awareness about drug addiction. OConnor also successfully lobbied to get the state of California to pass legislation allowing family members of an addicted person or anyone injured by a drug dealers actions, including employers, to sue for reimbursement for medical treatment and rehabilitation costs and other economic and noneconomic damages. The law, known as the Drug Dealer Civil Liability Act in California, went into effect in 1997. It is also referred to as the Hugh OConnor Memorial Law. The act is based on the Model Drug Dealer Liability Act authored in 1992 by then Hawaii U.S. Attorney Daniel Bent. The Model Drug Dealer Liability Act has been passed in 17 states and the Virgin Islands. A website devoted to the Act can be found at: www.ModelDDLA.com. Cases have been brought under the Act in California, Illinois, Utah, and other states.

His sons suicide inspired OConnor to start a crusade against the man who sold the drugs to Hugh. He called Harry Perzigian "a partner in murder" and a "sleazeball". Perzigian filed a defamation lawsuit against the actor. In 1997, a California jury threw out the case. In an interview on CNNs Larry King Live soon after the verdict, OConnor said he would never be able to put his sons death behind him. "I cant forget it. There isnt a day that I dont think of him and want him back and miss him, and Ill feel that way until Im not here any more," he said.

During the late 1990s, OConnor established a small automotive restoration shop in Newbury Park, California. Called "Carroll OConnor Classics", the shop contained many of OConnors personal vehicles and the cars once owned by his late son.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.motortrend.com/features/archive/112_9708_questioning_carroll_o_connor/index.html  title=10 Questions With...Carroll OConnor  work=Motor Trend Magazine  date=  accessdate=2012-04-10}}</ref> Among the cars OConnor owned were a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow sold to him by William Harrah, a Maserati 3500 GT, and a Dodge Challenger equipped with the 440-cubic inch V-8 that was the car he drove during production of All in the Family.

In 1997, the OConnors donated US$1&nbsp;million (worth ${{formatnum:{{Inflation US 1000000 1997}}}} today) to their alma mater to help match a challenge grant to the University of Montana from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The university named a regional studies and public policy institute the OConnor Center for the Rocky Mountain West.<ref name="UMT" /> Afterward, OConnor taught screenwriting at the university.

In 1998, OConnor underwent a second surgery to clear the blockage in a cardiac artery, to reduce his risk of stroke.

==Death==

OConnor died on June 21, 2001, in Culver City, California, from a heart attack brought on by complications from diabetes. He was 76 years old. His funeral Mass (liturgy) Mass was celebrated at St. Paul the Apostle Church and School St. Paul the Apostle Catholic Church in Westwood, Los Angeles, California, and was attended by All in the Family cast members Rob Reiner, Sally Struthers, and Danielle Brisebois, as well as producer Norman Lear. Jean Stapleton, who had been a close friend of OConnors since the early 1960s, did not attend the service due to a commitment for a stage performance.<ref>[http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4829789-1.html Hwood Family Turns Out To Remember Oconnor] {{webarchive  url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219111938/http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4829789-1.html  date=February 19, 2008 }}</ref>

OConnors best friend Larry Hagman and his family were also there, alongside the surviving cast of In the Heat of the Night, including Alan Autry and Denise Nicholas, who also attended the Mass. Actor Martin Sheen, then starring on The West Wing, delivered the eulogy.  OConnor is buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery with his son Hughs cenotaph placed on his grave stone.

In honor of OConnors career, TV Land moved an entire weekend of programming to the next week and showed a continuous marathon of All in the Family. During the commercial breaks, TV Land also showed interview footage of OConnor and various All in the Family actors, producers with whom he had worked, and other associates. His wife, Nancy Fields OConnor, died on November 10, 2014, at the age of 84.
