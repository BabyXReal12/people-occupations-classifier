Sir Kenneth Arthur Dodd {{Post-nominals country=GBR size=100% OBE}} (8 November 1927 – 11 March 2018) was an English stand-up comedy comedian, singer and occasional actor.  He was described as "the last great music hall entertainer", and was primarily known for his live stand-up comedy stand-up performances.

A lifelong resident of Knotty Ash in Liverpool, Dodds career as an entertainer started in the mid-1950s.  His performances included rapid and incessant delivery of often surreal jokes, and would run for several hours, frequently past midnight.  His verbal and physical comedy was supplemented by his red, white and blue "Feather duster tickling stick" Theatrical property prop, and often introduced by his characteristic upbeat greeting of "How tickled I am!"   He interspersed the comedy with songs, both serious and humorous, and with his original speciality, ventriloquism.  He also had several hit singles primarily as a ballad singer in the 1960s, and occasionally appeared in dramatic roles.  He performed on radio and television, and popularised the characters of the Diddy Men.
 	
He was Knight Bachelor knighted in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to entertainment and charity.  His stage career lasted for over 60 years, and he continued to perform, when his health permitted, until his death at the age of 90.

==Tax evasion court case==
In 1989, Dodd was charged with tax evasion. The subsequent trial, with the prosecution case led by Brian Leveson QC, produced several revelations. The Diddy Men, who had appeared in his stage act, were often played by local children from stage schools, and were revealed never to have been paid. Dodd was also revealed to have very little money in his bank account, having £336,000 in cash stashed in suitcases in his attic. When asked by the judge, "What does £100,000 in a suitcase feel like?", Dodd replied, "The notes are very light, MLord."<ref name="men">{{cite news   url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/comedy/s/234/234894_dodds_bolton_bonus.html   work=Manchester Evening News   date=1 February 2007   title=Dodds Bolton bonus   first=Natalie  last=Anglesey}}</ref>  He also said: "I am not mean, but I am nervous of money, nervous of having it, nervous of not having it" and described money as "important only because I have nothing else".<ref name="independentie"/>

Dodd was represented by George Carman QC, who in court famously quipped, "Some accountants are comedians, but comedians are never accountants".<ref name="bbcgc">{{cite news   url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1097749.stm   title=George Carman: The Bars silver fox   publisher=BBC News   date=2 January 2001}}</ref>  He described Dodd as "a fantasist stamped with lifelong eccentricities."<ref name="independentie"/>  The trial lasted three weeks; Dodd was acquitted.<ref name="bbcgc" />

Despite the strain of the trial, Dodd immediately capitalised on his new-found notoriety with a successful season running from Easter to Christmas 1990 at the London Palladium. It was there he had previously broken the house record for the longest comedy season at the theatre, in 1965, with a residency lasting 42 weeks. Some of his subsequent material mocked the trial and tax in general. For a while, he introduced his act with the words, "Good evening, my name is Kenneth Arthur Dodd; singer, photographic playboy and failed accountant!"<ref name="guardian">{{cite news   url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1332768,00.html   work=The Guardian   title=Tickling shtick   date=23 October 2004   location=London   first=Charles   last=Nevin   accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> Another memorable gag in regards to the matter was Dodd saying that when income tax was introduced it was a mere 2p in every £1 earned, followed by the punchline "I thought it still was!"
