==Career==
===Nightclub act===
Foxx gained notoriety with his raunchy nightclub act. After performing on the East Coast, his big break came after singer Dinah Washington insisted that he come to Los Angeles, where Dootsie Williams of Dootone records caught his act at the Brass Rail nightclub. Foxx was one of the first black comics to play to white audiences on the Las Vegas Strip. He was signed to a long-term contract and released a series of comedy albums that quickly became cult favorites.<ref name="People-28Oct1991">{{cite journal  last=Goodman  first=Mark  author=  authorlink=  editor1-first=  editor1-last=  editor1-link=  date=October 28, 1991  year=  month=  title=Redd Foxx exits, laughing journal=People  volume=36  series=  issue=16  page=  pages=  publisher=  issn=  pmid=  pmc=  doi=  bibcode=  url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20111147,00.html  accessdate=October 11, 2010  ref= }}</ref>

===Sanford and Son===
{{Main article Sanford and Son}} 
Foxx achieved his most widespread fame starring in the television sitcom Sanford and Son,<ref name=NYT/> an adaptation of the BBC series Steptoe and Son. He used his starring role on Sanford and Son to help get jobs for his acquaintances such as LaWanda Page, Slappy White, Gregory Sierra, Don Bexley, Beah Richards, Stymie Beard, Leroy Daniels, Ernest Mayhand and Pat Morita Noriyuki "Pat" Morita.

The series premiered on the NBC NBC television network on January 14, 1972 and was broadcast for six seasons. The final episode aired on March 25, 1977. Foxx played the role of Fred G. Sanford ("Fred Sanford" was actually Foxxs fathers and brothers name), while Foxxs co-star Demond Wilson played the role of his son Lamont. In this sitcom, Fred and Lamont were owners of a junk/salvage store in Watts, Los Angeles Watts who dealt with many humorous situations that would arise. The series was notable for its ethnic joke racial humor and overt prejudices which helped Sanford and Son#Production notes redefine the genre of black sitcom black situation comedy.

The show also had several running gags. When angry with Lamont, Fred would often say "You big dummy" or would often fake heart attacks by putting his hand on his chest and saying (usually while looking up at the sky) "Its Sanford and Son#The Big One the big one, Im coming to join ya honey/Elizabeth" (referring to his late wife). Fred would also complain about having arthritis "arthur-itis" to get out of working by showing Lamont his cramped hand. Foxx depicted a character in his 60s, although in real-life he was a decade younger.

Demond Wilson was asked whether he kept in touch with everybody from Sanford & Son, especially the series star himself, after the series was canceled: "No. I saw Redd Foxx once before he died, circa 1983, and I never saw him again. At the time I was playing tennis at the Malibu Racquet Club and I was approached by some producers about doing a Redd Foxx 50th Anniversary Special. I hadn’t spoken to him since 1977, and I called the club where (Redd) was playing. And we met at Redd’s office, but he was less than affable. I told those guys it was a bad idea. I never had a cross word with him. People say I’m protective of Redd Foxx in my book (Second Banana, Wilson’s memoir of the Sanford years). I had no animosity toward Foxx for (quitting the show in 1977) because I had a million dollar contract at CBS to do Baby I’m Back. My hurt was that he didn’t come to me about throwing the towel in - I found out in the hallway at NBC from a newscaster. I forgave him and I loved Redd, but I never forgot that. The love was there. You can watch any episode and see that."<ref>{{cite web url=http://beachcomberdestin.com/destin/article-966-qa-with-demond-wilson.html title=Q&A With Demond Wilson publisher=BeachcomberDestin.com date=January 15, 2014  accessdate=August 9, 2017}}</ref>
