Severn Teakle Darden Jr. (November 9, 1929 – May 27, 1995) was an American comedian and actor, and an original member of The Second City Chicago-based comedy troupe as well as its predecessor, the Compass Players. He is perhaps best known from his film appearances for playing the human leader List of Planet of the Apes characters#Kolp Kolp in the fourth and fifth Planet of the Apes films.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web title=Severn Darden, 65, a Master of Improvisation first=Ronald last=Sullivan date=May 27, 1995 url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/27/obituaries/severn-darden-65-a-master-of-improvisation.html work=The New York Times}}</ref>

==Background==
Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, he attended the University of Chicago.  Darden’s offbeat and intellectual sense of humor, appropriate for someone who attended the University of Chicago and in fact a major element in the style of The Second City at that time, is evident throughout his work.

One example of his offbeat humor is the way he squeezed the phrase "Know thyself" into the seven-character limitation of a New Mexico license plate: NOYOSEF.

Darden appeared in various movies and television series. His best performance is probably in the comedy The Presidents Analyst; there he has a major role as Kropotkin, a Soviet agent with a laid-back persona (much like Dardens own). An early film, "LUV" (1967) (based on the play of the same title by Murray Schisgal), in which he played a junk dealer, also starred Jack Lemmon, Peter Falk, Elaine May, and Nina Wayne.

One of his earliest TV roles was on Car 54 Where Are You? in the episode "Toody and the Art World" in which he played the artist Karpathia.

He also played a wiktionary:stuffed shirt stuffed shirt toy manufacturer in an episode of The Monkees (TV series) The Monkees and Dr. Herb Chisholm in a 1976 episode of the NBC situation comedy The Practice (1976 TV series) The Practice. He appeared in "Never Con a Killer," the pilot for the American Broadcasting Company ABC crime drama The Feather and Father Gang, in 1977. He played the cold-hearted Kolp (Planet of the Apes) Kolp in Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and Battle for the Planet of the Apes, and a highly respected, but befuddled college dean, in the 1985 in film 1985 comedy Real Genius.

In 1986, he was featured in the Off-Broadway improvisational sketch comedy show, Sills & Company, directed by Paul Sills.

After triple heart bypass surgery, he lived in semi-retirement in Los Angeles before moving to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1992. He died there of congestive heart failure at age 65. His interment was at Lake Lawn Park and Mausoleum in his hometown of New Orleans.

==Works==

===Routines===

====The Metaphysics Lecture====
This was ostensibly given by Prof. Walther von der Vogelweide, a reference to the Walther von der Vogelweide famous medieval poet of the same name. An announcer introduces it as A Short Talk on the Universe, and then Darden continues: "Now, why — you will ask me — have I chosen to speak on the Universe, rather than some other topic.  Well, its very simple: there isn’t anything else!" The lecture is loaded with digressions.

====Oedipus====
This was another Prof. Walther von der Vogelweide lecture (with the assistance of the rest of the Second City cast). The subject was "free will and necessity in the light of...Oedipus Rex", or "what would have happened to Oedipus if he had read the book before going on the journey". The professor plays the role of Oedipus and refuses to perform the acts that would lead to his fate, but finds that despite his apparent agency (philosophy) agency the other characters respond in ways that produce the same results.

In the first scene, Oedipus encounters his father Laius, knowing that if all goes according to the book the two will get into a Punch (combat) brawl, and he will commit the serious sin of patricide killing his own father.  Aware of this, Oedipus is very deferential to Laius, only to find that the father is extremely touchy and hostile to anything that smacks of sycophant sycophancy.  Despite Oedipus continued deference and protestations, Laius becomes increasingly angry until he suddenly suffers a fatal myocardial infarction heart attack.

In the next scene, the Sphinx energetically  tries to wheedle him into answering her riddle correctly, which Oedipus does not want to do. At one point she says, "Think of the power—of the glory—". He responds, "I dont need power and glory, Im a full professor."

In the final scene, Oedipus prepares to gouge his eyes out. At the last second, he stops when he realizes that the tragic choices were actually forced on him against his will. He explains all this to the crowd, ending with "Its not my fault!" The crowd agrees, and his eyes are saved. The professor ends the sketch by saying, "So you see, my dear students, the lesson that we learn from this is that Man has free will, but tragic poets do not, and Art is not Nature."

====Football Comes to the University of Chicago====
This sketch was originally developed for the Compass Players and revisited for Second City. It satirized the university and its students, presenting a possible explanation for the failure to introduce football. A typical coach teaches "Football 202" and struggles with the intellectual students. Darden plays Morgenstern, a student who states his field is the "history of arithmetic". After the coach mentions the football positions called "ends", Morgenstern asks where the beginnings for those ends are, because ends must have beginnings, according to Aristotle. The coach presents the football, and Morgenstern declares, "Its a demi-poly-tetrahedron."

===Television series===
* Alfred Hitchcock Presents, "Beta Delta Gamma" (1961)
* Charlie Paradise TV series pilot (1960). Darden played an eccentric painter named Flute who is murdered in his Greenwich Village studio in this unsold pilot intended as a spinoff to the Edward Binns CBS drama "Brenner", and which was eventually repackaged for air as the last episode of the series.
* Car 54, Where Are You?: "Toody and the Art World" (1962). Darden plays Karpathia, a painter whose work appears to awaken an enthusiasm for modern art in Toody. This episode is particularly notable because Karpathias temperament and accent somewhat resemble those of Professor Walther von der Vogelweide. Thus the portrayal gives us a hint of what Darden was like in his lectures. Dardens scenes take up about 9 minutes of the episode.
* Honey West (TV series) Honey West, "Little Green Robin Hood" (1966)
* The Monkees (TV series) The Monkees, "Monkee vs. Machine" (1966). He plays the confused president of a toy company who is manipulated by Daggart (Stan Freberg), a scheming executive who wants to make shoddier toys for the purpose of "planned obsolescence".
* The Monkees (TV series) The Monkees, "The Monkees Paw" (1968). In a very brief scene, Darden has the role of a psychiatrist who angrily insists that the Monkees interpretations of inkblots are wrong. This is notable because the portrayal is exactly like Professor Walther von der Vogelweide in his most vehement moments.
* I Dream of Jeannie , "Jeannie and the Great Bank Robbery" (1967)
* Daniel Boone (1964 TV series) Daniel Boone (1968)
* It Takes a Thief (1968 TV series) It Takes a Thief, "Saturday Night In Venice" (1969)
