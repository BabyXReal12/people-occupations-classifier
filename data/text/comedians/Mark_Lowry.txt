==Early career==
While attending Liberty Baptist College (now known as Liberty University), Lowry joined a college evangelistic team made of Charles Hughes and David Musselman and began singing.  His comedy career inadvertently began from here. There would be an elongated pause in his singing performance while he waited for the soundtrack to be changed. Lowry began to fill this pause with a monologue. He soon realized that the audiences at his performances were laughing not at him but at his monologues.

In 1978, Lowry was badly injured in a car accident near Carlisle, Pennsylvania, while touring with his college evangelistic team.<ref>{{Cite web url=https://prezi.com/tbo9hzoedebu/mark-lowry/ title=Mark Lowry website=prezi.com access-date=2016-10-15}}</ref> He sustained eleven broken bones, and spent a good deal of time in physical therapy recovering from the accident.

=="Mary, Did You Know?"==
In 1984, Lowry wrote the lyrics to the song "Mary, Did You Know?", when asked to write a script for a church Christmas play. He wrote a series of questions that he would like to ask Mary (mother of Jesus) Mary, the mother of Jesus. These questions were used in between the scenes of the play. Over the next decade, Lowry tried to find music that would complete the song. Eventually, musician and songwriter Buddy Greene wrote the music to the song. The Christmas play script then became the song.

The song has become a popular Christmas song performed by more than thirty artists including Cee Lo Green, Clay Aiken, Kenny Rogers, Wynonna Judd, Michael English (American singer) Michael English, Daniel Childs, Natalie Cole,  Pippa Wilson<ref>[http://pippawilson.com/cd/cd_3.htm Pippa Wilson]</ref> Kathy Mattea, Michael Crawford, Zara Larsson, Peter Hollens, and Pentatonix.

==The Gaither Vocal Band==

In 1988, Lowry was approached by Bill Gaither (gospel singer) Bill Gaither and asked to join the Gaither Vocal Band as the baritone.  Lowrys career with the band spanned thirteen years during his first stint with the group. His on-stage antics were popular with audiences. As a result, he became the co-host of the many concerts and shows performed by Gaither and the Vocal Band, with Gaither playing the Double act straight man to Lowrys antics.

In June 2001, Lowry resigned from the Gaither Vocal Band after performing longer with the group than any previous member except  Gaither himself.<ref>[http://www.marklowry.com/newsletter/remarks/2001remarks/remarks_125.htm Mark Lowry – reMarks newsletter<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404224454/http://www.marklowry.com/newsletter/remarks/2001remarks/remarks_125.htm  date=2011-04-04 }}</ref> After that, Lowry released several solo albums, including I Love to Tell the Story, A Hymns Collection.
