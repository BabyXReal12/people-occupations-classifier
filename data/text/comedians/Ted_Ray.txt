A music hall comedian, Ray usually played violin badly as part of his act—first as Hugh Neek, then "Nedlo the Gypsy Violinist".<ref name="Clarke">{{Cite book title=Pseudonyms author=Joseph F. Clarke publisher=BCA date=1977 page=137}}</ref>  He also played comedy roles in several British films—notably as the headmaster in Carry On Teacher.  He is best remembered for the Sunday lunchtime radio show Rays a Laugh, a domestic comedy in which Kitty Bluett played his wife.  Other actors and actresses who featured on the show included Peter Sellers, Fred Yule, Patricia Hayes, Kenneth Connor, Pat Coombs and Graham Stark; Sellers earliest appearances predated The Goon Show by a couple of years.  In 1940 and 1950 Ray was King Rat of the Grand Order of Water Rats.

Ray was an accomplished golfer, frequently playing with professional sportsmen.  Later in his career he appeared with Jimmy Edwards, Arthur Askey and Cyril Fletcher in the comedy radio panel game Does the Team Think?

Ray appeared on television reading on Jackanory, a childrens programme, in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1974, he presented a radio show on BBC Radio 2, The Betty Witherspoon Show, with Kenneth Williams, Miriam Margolyes and Nigel Rees. He was also involved in Jokers Wild (TV series) Jokers Wild, an ITV celebrity comedy game show (1971–74) which was chaired by Barry Cryer. Arthur Askey was another regular on the show.

He married showgirl Dorothy (née Sibil) and the couple had two sons: Robin Ray, a well-known television personality in the 1960s and 1970s, who initiated Call My Bluff (UK game show) Call My Bluff and specialist classical music shows, and Andrew Ray, a child star of the 1950s who had a long career on stage, film and television.

He was the subject of This Is Your Life (UK TV series) This Is Your Life on two occasions, in October 1955 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre, and in February 1975, when Andrews surprised him on the doorstep of his Southgate, London Southgate home.

In 1975, returning home from a day of golfing and alcohol, two of his passions, Ray was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident. The injuries sustained had a physically debilitating effect and left him dependent on crutches.{{citation needed date=February 2015}}

In 1977 he recorded a half-hour interview, talking about his life. This was repeated on Radio 4 Extras Its a Funny Business series on 3 November 2013. On 8 November 1977 he suffered a fatal heart attack.{{citation needed date=February 2015}}

==Rays a Laugh (1949–61)==
Nedlo, the Gypsy Violinist, started his own show in 1949 and made a success of it. Rays a Laugh did not include Nedlos name in the credits, nor indeed that of Charlie Olden (Rays real name). Nedlo/Olden was, by 1949, calling himself Ted Ray (after the golfer<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b007jpy4/How_Tickled_Am_I_Series_2_Ted_Ray/ BBC Radio 7 : How Tickled Am I? – Series 2 – Ted Ray]{{expired link date=September 2016}}</ref>); this was how he billed himself for his radio series.

Rays a Laugh was a domestic comedy. Rays wife was played by Kitty Bluett. Fred Yule played his brother-in-law. Patricia Hayes appeared, as did Kenneth Connor as Sidney Mincing. In later series Ray had left the Cannon Enquiry Agency and joined the Daily Bugle as a reporter. Jack Watson (actor) Jack Watson and Charles Leno joined the cast and new characters included Mrs Dipper and Roger Curfew, the paying guest with songs by John Hanson and the Kings Men.

Another early member was Peter Sellers, then 23 and billing himself as an impressionist. He appeared as Soppy, a small boy criticised by the nations watchdogs for his catchphrase, "Just like your big red conk!" Another of his characters was a strange woman, Crystal Jollibottom  ("Stop it you saucebox!" he would cry in a crazy falsetto). Laidman Browne, as Rays boss Mr Trumble, Pat Coombs as Ursula Prune, Charles Leno and Graham Stark were also present. Percy Edwards, the animal impersonator, played Gregory the chicken.

There was the glamour girl who would do anything, but "Not until after six-oclock!"  Songs came from the Beaux and the Belles, and Bob and Alf Pearson provided the musical interlude – "We bring you melodies from out of the sky, my brother and I!"  Bob also played the little girl Jennifer who, asked her name, would coyly reply: "Jen-ni-fer!"

The show was no real departure from tradition, even in its catch-phrases. There was Ivys (Ted Ray) devotion to Mrs Hoskins, for instance: "Youre a lovely woman, Mrs Hoskins!" And it was she to whom Mrs Hoskins would remark weakly: "It was agony, Ivy!" And whenever Ivy felt poorly, Mrs Hoskins would say, "Ill have to send for young Dr Hardcastle" to which Ivy would reply, "Hes lovely, Mrs Hoskins, Hes loooooovely!"

There was the adenoidal "If you havent been to Manchester, you havent lived" from Tommy Trotter (Graham Stark).

Rays a Laugh ran from 1949 until January 1961, eventually dropping the musical items. Ray also showed his skill at ad-libbing (together with Jimmy Edwards, Arthur Askey and Cyril Fletcher) in Does the Team Think?

==The Ted Ray Show (1955–59)==
The first series accented variety, with international guests; the second and third series had greater emphasis on stand-up comedy; the fourth featured domestic routines (with Diane Hart as Ted Rays wife and Kenneth Connor as "that interfering brother-in-law"); the fifth and six—with new writers—concentrated on sketch comedy and were branded New Edition and 1959 Edition to underline the difference.
