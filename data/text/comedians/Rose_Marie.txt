Marie was married to trumpeter Bobby Guy from 1946 until his death in 1964.
The couple had one daughter, Georgiana.
Around 1972, Marie began a platonic social life with Pussycat Theater Vince Miranda.
She was active on social media, particularly developing a following on Twitter, where she offered support for women who like her had suffered from Weinstein effect sexual harassment.
Her contemporaries and modern performers offered their remembrances and condolences on the same platform; Nell Scovell called her "the patron saint of female comedy writers.
