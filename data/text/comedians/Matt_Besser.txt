Twisted also featured Besser in a series of improvised commercials directed by O’Donnell for McDonalds, Toyota, and Ameritech along with stand-up comic Michelle Garb.

In 1996, the UCB relocated to New York City. In NYC, they made three seasons of their sketch-comedy series Upright Citizens Brigade on Comedy Central from 1998 to 2000. The cast consisted of Besser, Amy Poehler, Ian Roberts (American actor) Ian Roberts and Matt Walsh (comedian) Matt Walsh. It originally included a voice-over by Del Close. Since its cancellation, Comedy Central has since released all three seasons on DVD.

Besser and the UCB moved on to other projects and opened comedy theaters in New York City and Los Angeles. He was the creator and co-star of the Method Man & Redman Redman & Method Man MTV hidden camera prank show Stung.

The troupe had also performed their signature brand of longform improv (ASSSSCAT) in a special for the Bravo (US TV channel) Bravo channel in 2005. In 2008, they released a DVD entitled ASSSSCAT!: Renegade Improv Comedy through Shout! Factory, which features an uncensored improv performance by the troupe and special guests. The DVD also includes deleted scenes and along with other bonus features.

In 2008, Besser played the part of "Courtney Frenchip", the hippie roommate of David Cross in Davids Situation, a pilot made for HBO written by Cross and Bob Odenkirk. As Odenkirk explained on his web site, "It will follow a traditional sitcom feeling, but will also feel like a big sketch, even though the characters will remain the same each week." The pilot was filmed live on May 9, 2008 but was not picked by HBO as a series. In 2013, he portrayed Edwin Stanton in the "Chicago" episode of Comedy Centrals Drunk History.

Besser and the UCB continue to run comedy theaters on both coasts. The Upright Citizens Brigade Theater currently has four locations: Chelsea, Manhattan, the East Village, Manhattan, Franklin Village, Los Angeles, California and East Hollywood, Los Angeles, California.
