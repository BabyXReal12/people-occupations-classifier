==Early life==
Ardal OHanlon was born on 8 October 1965 in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, the son of politician and doctor Rory OHanlon and Teresa Ward. He has five siblings. The episode of Who Do You Think You Are? (Irish TV series) Who Do You Think You Are? which aired on 6 October 2008 revealed that OHanlons paternal grandfather, Michael OHanlon, was a University College Dublin UCD medicine student who had joined the Irish Republican Army (1917–22) IRA during the Irish War of Independence and was a member of Michael Collins (Irish leader) Michael Collins squad which assassinated British secret service agents on the morning of Bloody Sunday (1920) Bloody Sunday. Details of his grandfathers activities survive in UCD Archives, as well as Blackrock College. It also transpired that, on his mothers side, he is a close relative of Peter Fenelon Collier.

OHanlon was schooled in Blackrock College in Dublin and graduated, in 1987, from the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin (now Dublin City University) with a degree in Communications Studies.

==Career==
Together with Kevin Gildea and Barry Murphy, OHanlon founded the International Comedy Cellar, upstairs in the International Bar on Dublins South Wicklow Street. Dublin had no comedy scene at the time. As a stand up, OHanlon won the Hackney Empire New Act of the Year competition in 1994. For a time he was the presenter of The Stand Up Show.

He was spotted by Graham Linehan, who was to cast him as Father Dougal McGuire in Father Ted (1995–98). In 1995 he received the Top TV Comedy Newcomer at the British Comedy Awards for this role. In 1995, he appeared (as Father Dougal) in a Channel 4 Television ident ident ("Hello, youre watching.... television"), and during Comic Relief (charity) Comic Relief on BBC1. This was followed by the award-winning short comedy film Flying Saucer RocknRoll.

OHanlon moved into straight acting alongside Emma Fielding and Beth Goddard in the ITV (TV network) ITV comedy-drama Big Bad World, which aired for two series in summer 1999 and winter 2001. He also played a minor role in The Butcher Boy (1997 film) The Butcher Boy as Joes (Francies best friend) father, and appeared in an episode of the original Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series) Whose Line is it Anyway?.

In 2000, OHanlon starred in the comedy series My Hero (UK TV series) My Hero, in which he played a very naive superhero from the planet Ultron. His character juggled world-saving heroics with life in suburbia. He stayed in the role until the first episode of series 6 in July 2006 where he was replaced by James Dreyfus during the same episode.

He also provided the voice of the lead character in the three Christmas television cartoon specials of Robbie the Reindeer. He appeared in the 2005 BBC One sitcom Blessed (television) Blessed, written by Ben Elton; at the 2005 British Comedy Awards, it was publicly slated by Jonathan Ross (television presenter) Jonathan Ross, albeit in jest.{{Citation needed date=May 2008}} Towards the end of 2005, he played an eccentric Scottish character, Coconut Tam, in the family-based film, The Adventures of Greyfriars Bobby. Although more commonly on television, he has appeared on radio  – on 18 July 2011, he appeared on Quote... Unquote. Appropriately, one of his questions concerned a quotation from Father Ted.

In 2006, OHanlon wrote and presented an Raidió Teilifís Éireann RTÉ television series called Leagues Apart, which saw him investigate the biggest and most passionate football rivalries in a number of European countries. Included were Roma vs Lazio in Italy, Barcelona vs Real Madrid in Spain, and Galatasaray vs Fenerbahce in Turkey. He followed this with another RTÉ show, So You Want To Be Taoiseach? in 2007. It was a political series where OHanlon gave tongue-in-cheek advice on how to go about becoming Taoiseach of Ireland. Both programmes went some way towards freeing OHanlon from his association with the character of Dougal in the minds of Irish audiences.

He appeared in the Doctor Who episode "Gridlock (Doctor Who) Gridlock", broadcast on 14 April 2007, in which he played a cat-like creature named Thomas Kincade Brannigan.
OHanlon appears in Series 3 of the TV show Skins (TV series) Skins, playing Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless)s Politics teacher named Kieran, who attempted to kiss her. He then went on to form a relationship with Naomis mother (Olivia Colman). OHanlon plays the lead role in Irish comedy television programme Val Falvey, TD on RTÉ One. He has recently{{When date=March 2012}} performed in the Edinburgh Fringe.

In February 2011, OHanlon returned to the Gate Theatre, Dublin starring in the Irish premiere of Christopher Hamptons translation of Yasmina Rezas God of Carnage, alongside Maura Tierney.

In 2011, he appeared in the comedy panel show Argumental.

OHanlon has written a novel, The Talk of the Town (novel) The Talk of the Town (known in the United States as Knick Knack Paddy Whack), which was published in 1998. The novel is about a teenage boy, Patrick Scully, and his friends.

In February 2015 he officially launched the 2015 Sky Cat Laughs Comedy Festival which takes place in Kilkenny from 28 May–1 June.
In 2015 he played the role of Peter the Milkman in the Sky 1 sitcom After Hours (UK TV series) After Hours.

On 2 February 2017, it was announced he will play the lead role in the BBC crime drama Death in Paradise (TV series) Death in Paradise taking the role of DI Jack Mooney following Kris Marshalls departure the same day.
