Bernard "Ben" Turpin (September 19, 1869<ref name=birth/>&nbsp;– July 1, 1940) was an American comedian and actor, best remembered for his work in silent films. His trademarks were his Strabismus cross-eyed appearance and adeptness at vigorous physical comedy. Turpin worked with notable performers such as Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy, and was a part of the Mack Sennett studio team. He is believed to have been the first filmed "victim" of the Pieing pie in the face gag. When sound came to films, Turpin chose to retire, having invested profitably in real estate, although he did do occasional cameos. 

==Personal life==
Turpin was born in New Orleans, Louisiana on September 19, 1869,<ref name=birth>His birth date was given as September 19, 1869, but other years were used at various times in his Hollywood publicity material. In the 1900 United States Census he used the year "1869", and his death certificate used "1869", and that year will be used here. Encyclopædia Britannica wrongly lists the year of his birth as "1874". The New York Times obituary mentions the alternate years as fabrications. His death certificate lists his birthday as "September 19, 1869" and lists his mothers maiden name as "Buckley". The Internet Movie Database lists his birthday properly as "September 19, 1869".</ref> the son of a candy store owner,{{Citation needed reason=what source gives his fathers occupation? date=January 2016}} Ernest Turpin, and Sarah Buckley.<ref name=BabetteMarriage />

==Vaudeville==
Turpin worked in vaudeville, American burlesque burlesque, and circuses. He had a distinctive appearance, with a small wiry frame, a brush mustache, and Strabismus crossed eyes. Turpins famous eyes, he said, only crossed as a young adult after he suffered an accident. He was convinced that the crossed eyes were essential to his comic career; his co-workers recalled that after he received any blow to the head he made a point of looking himself in the mirror to assure himself that they had not become uncrossed. He was a devout Catholicism Catholic,<ref name="Funeral"/><ref name="Requiem Mass">{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=acYwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dv4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4805,173466&dq=ben+turpin+mass+1940&hl=en title=Ben Turpin Funeral Will Be Tomorrow date=July 2, 1940 publisher=Toledo Blade accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref> and his workmates occasionally goaded him by threatening to pray that his eyes would uncross, thus depriving him of his livelihood.

Turpin famously bought a $25,000 insurance policy with Lloyds of London, payable if his eyes ever uncrossed. A 1920 version of the story had his eyes insured for $100,000.<ref>author, p. 6.</ref> How serious this was is open to question; such publicity stunts centered around a performers "trademark" were common at the time.

He developed a vigorous style of physical comedy, including an ability to stage comic pratfalls that impressed even his fellow workers in the rough-and-tumble world of silent comedy. One of his specialties was a forward tumble he called the "hundred an eight".  It was basically an interrupted forward somersault initiated by kicking one leg up, turning over 180 degrees to land flat on the back or in a seated position.

==Film==

Ben Turpin first appeared on film in 1907 for Essanay Studios in Chicago in various small parts and comic bits. In addition to his on-screen work, he worked as a carpenter and janitor for Essanay.<ref>author, p. 1.</ref> In the 1909 film Mr. Flip, Turpin receives what is believed to have been the first pie-in-the-face.<ref>{{cite web   title = A Very Brief History of Slapstick   work = Splat TV   year = 2003   url = http://splat-tv.artshtick.com/history.html   accessdate = 2009-01-29  archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090224203322/http://splat-tv.artshtick.com/history.html  archivedate= February 24, 2009   deadurl= no}}</ref> By 1912 he was an established – if not major – screen personality, giving interviews and writing articles for the new fan magazines (the first of which had started the year before).

Charlie Chaplin joined the Essanay company in 1915, and the studio made Turpin his second banana. Chaplin was maturing as a filmmaker, working slowly and intuitively. Turpin, however, was impatient with Chaplins methods. The earthy Turpin understood straightforward slapstick more than comic subtlety. The Chaplin-Turpin duo didnt last long, with Chaplin abandoning Chicago for California. Turpin does share one additional credit with Chaplin: after Chaplin filmed Burlesque on Carmen in two reels, Essanay filmed new scenes with Turpin to pad the picture into a featurette, doubling its length.

Essanay did not survive Chaplins departure and remained solvent for only a few more years. Turpin may have been aware of Essanays instability; he left for the Vogue comedy company, where he starred in a series of two-reel comedies. Former Essanay comedian Paddy McQuire supported him. Many of Turpins Vogue comedies were re-released under different titles, to cash in on Turpins subsequent stardom.

==Mack Sennett and stardom==
In 1917 Ben Turpin joined the leading comedy company, the Mack Sennett studio. Turpins aptitude for crude slapstick suited the Sennett style perfectly, and Sennetts writers often cast the ridiculous-looking Turpin against type (a rugged Yukon miner; a suave, worldly lover; a stalwart cowboy; a fearless stuntman, etc.) for maximum comic effect. Through the 1920s his roles often spoofed serious actors and celebrities of the time – e.g., "The Shriek" for "The Sheik" – and Turpin became one of films most popular comics. Turpin appeared in both short subjects and feature films for Sennett. Delighted with his success, he took to introducing himself with the phrase, "Im Ben Turpin; I make $3,000 a week."

Sennett terminated most of his staffs contracts in 1928, and closed the studio to retool for the new talking pictures. Turpin was signed by the low-budget Weiss Brothers-Artclass company, perhaps the most ambitious coup that Artclass ever attempted. Turpin made two-reel comedies there for one year. Artclass usually traded on his peculiar vision with titles like Idle Eyes and The Eyes Have It.

==Turpin in the sound era==
1929 saw many silent-film stars uncertain about their future employment, with the new talking pictures requiring new skills and techniques. Ben Turpin chose to retire. He had invested his earnings in real estate, and, being highly successful at this, had no financial need for more work. Producers soon sought him out for gag appearances in films. He commanded a flat fee of $1000 per appearance, regardless of whether it was a speaking role or a fleeting cameo. Among the most memorable of these cameos was in Paramounts Million Dollar Legs (1932 film) Million Dollar Legs (1932) starring W. C. Fields, Jack Oakie, and Susan Fleming.

He starred in only one more short subject, Keystone Hotel (film) Keystone Hotel (Warner Bros., 1935), a two-reel reunion of silent-era comedians. Turpins speaking voice was a gritty rasp that retained elements of the Yat (New Orleans) New Orleans "Yat" accent of his youth. His last feature film was Laurel and Hardys Saps at Sea in 1940, in which his cross-eyed face served as a joke punchline. He was paid his $1000 for one quick shot of his face and just 16 words of dialogue. Death prevented his scheduled appearance in Charlie Chaplins The Great Dictator.<ref>Rydzewski, p. 358.</ref>

==Death==


Ben Turpin died July 1, 1940 of a heart attack<ref>{{cite book first=Jean-Louis last=Ginibre title=Ladies or Gentlemen publisher=Filipacchi Publishing location=New York City year=2005}}</ref> and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California, following a Requiem Mass at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills.<ref name="Requiem Mass"/> He was eulogized as "a fine member of his church, strong in his faith" by Father J. P. Concannon.  His pallbearers included Andy Clyde, Billy Bevan, James Finlayson (actor) James Finlayson, and Charles Murray (American actor) Charlie Murray.<ref name="Funeral">{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XdQOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9E8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5449,1582309&dq=ben+turpin&hl=en title=Veterans of Films Honor Ben Turpin date=July 4, 1940 publisher=Prescott Evening Courier accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref>

==Turpins crossed eyes==
Turpin and Sennett both appeared as themselves (in Technicolor) in Hollywood Cavalcade (1939), a partly fictionalized movie about the silent-film era. This movie contains a sequence in which Turpin reports for work and prepares to go onto the set in character. In the dressing room he picks up a hand mirror and checks his reflection as he deliberately crosses his eyes as extremely as possible. In this sequence, it can be seen that Turpins left eye was actually normal when he was not performing, and that he intentionally crossed it (to match his misaligned right eye) as part of his screen character.

In the film The Comic (1969), Mickey Rooney plays a fictional silent-film comedian named "Cockeye Van Buren", who is genuinely cross-eyed. Although this character does not otherwise resemble Turpin, the handicap given to Rooneys role is clearly inspired by Turpin.
