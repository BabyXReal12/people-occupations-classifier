==Career==
Bernhard became a staple at The Comedy Store. As her popularity as a comedian grew she was cast as a supporting player on The Richard Pryor Show in 1977. Guest appearances on evening talk shows followed. Her big break came in 1983 when she was cast by Martin Scorsese to star as stalker and kidnapper Masha in the film The King of Comedy (film) The King of Comedy for which she won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress.

She began performing her first one-woman show called Im Your Woman in 1985, and an album version was released. Bernhard appeared in a variety of tiny film and television roles throughout the 1980s while crafting her stand-up routine into a more performance art oriented show. She launched an Off-Broadway one woman show called Without You Im Nothing, with You Im Not Much Better in 1988 which played at the Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan) Orpheum Theatre. In 1990 it was turned into a Without You Im Nothing (film) film and a Without You Im Nothing (Sandra Bernhard album) double album of the same title. The film was mostly shot on location in 1989 in the coconut grove at the Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles) Ambassador Hotel. A frequent guest on David Lettermans NBC program, it was during the run of Without You Im Nothing, With You Im Not Much Better that she appeared with her then-good friend (and rumored lover) Madonna (entertainer) Madonna on the show. The two alluded to their romantic relationship and staged a sexy confrontation. They would continue to be friends for several years, with Bernhard even making an appearance in Madonnas movie Madonna: Truth or Dare Truth or Dare.

In 1991, Bernhard began playing the role of Nancy Bartlett on the hit sitcom Roseanne (TV series) Roseanne. She appeared in 33 episodes between 1991 and 1997, and was one of the first actresses to portray an openly lesbian recurring character on American television. The role is one of her best known, something she has lamented in her stand-up as being both a blessing and a curse. In September 1992, Bernhard did a nude pictorial for Playboy. She hosted the USA Networks Reel Wild Cinema for two seasons beginning in 1995. Bernhard continued acting in mostly independent films and TV guest roles and forays into mainstream films such as Hudson Hawk and Dallas Doll. In 1991 she released her first studio album, entitled Excuses for Bad Behavior#Part one Excuses for Bad Behavior (Part One). In 1995, she briefly appeared as a guest in the animated talk show Space Ghost Coast to Coast, in an episode titled "Jerk". In 1996, she guest-starred on an episode of Highlander: The Series called "Dramatic License" in which she played a romance novelist writing about the life of the main character. She also appeared (as herself) on Will&nbsp;& Grace in an episode dealing with Will and Graces spuriously bidding on Bernhards Manhattan apartment in order to become friendly with her and culminates in a diatribe from Bernhard when their ruse is exposed, with obfuscating sounds of a blender (she was having a smoothie made) blotting out supposed obscenities. She returned as herself briefly, two years later.

Bernhard returned to Broadway in 1998 with the show Im Still Here... Damn It!, recorded for a live comedy album. At that time of the show Bernhard was pregnant. She gave birth to daughter Cicely Yasin Bernhard on July 4, 1998.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/07/08/entertainment/main13451.shtml?source=search_story Bernhard Goes Maternal], CBS News, July 8, 1998, last accessed July 1, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/News/9807/08/showbuzz/ Sandra Bernhard a mom at 42] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029070648/http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/News/9807/08/showbuzz/  date=2008-10-29 }}, CNN, July 8, 1998, last accessed July 1, 2008.</ref> Bernhard returned to New York in 2006 with the Off-Broadway show Everything Bad & Beautiful.
