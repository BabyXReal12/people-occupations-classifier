Louis Francis Cristillo (March 6, 1906&nbsp;– March 3, 1959), known by the stage name Lou Costello, was an American actor of radio, stage, television and film and burlesque comedian best remembered for the comedy double act of Abbott and Costello, with Bud Abbott. They started in burlesque, before showcasing their routines on radio, on Broadway, and in Hollywood films between 1940–1956.<ref name=nytobit /> Costello played a bumbling character opposite Abbotts straight man (stock character) straight man.  He was known for the catchphrases "Heeeeyyy, Abbott!" and "Im a baaaaad boy!"

==Early life==
Costello was born Louis Francis Cristillo on March 6, 1906, in Paterson, New Jersey, the son of Helen Rege and Sebastiano Cristillo.<ref name=nytobit /> His father was Italian (from Calabria, Italy) and his mother was an American of Italian, French, and Irish ancestry.<ref>http://www.louandbud.com/Lou.htm, accessed January 30, 2007</ref><ref name="google">{{cite book title=Bud & Lou: The Abbott & Costello Story author=Thomas, B. date=1977 publisher=Lippincott isbn=9780397011957 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-dNAAAAYAAJ access-date=15 November 2014}}</ref> He attended School 15<ref name="k12">{{cite web url=http://www.paterson.k12.nj.us/schools/ps15/ title=Public School #15 publisher=paterson.k12.nj.us access-date=15 November 2014}}</ref> in Paterson and was considered a gifted athlete. He excelled in basketball and reportedly was once the New Jersey state free throw champion (his singular basketball prowess can be seen in Here Come the Co-Eds (1945), in which he performs all his own tricky hoop shots without special effects). He also fought as a boxer under the name "Lou King".<ref name="First, p. 7.">C.

==Family==
On January 30, 1934, Costello married Anne Battler, a burlesque dancer. Their first child, Patricia "Paddy" Costello, was born in 1936, followed by Carole on December 23, 1938, and Lou Jr. (nicknamed "Butch") on November 6, 1942.<ref name=stricken>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VgkrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wpkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4428,2487619&dq=lou+costello&hl=en title=Mrs. Lou Costello Fatally Stricken date=6 December 1959 work=Reading Eagle access-date=21 November 2012}}</ref> On August 15, 1947, their last child, Christine, was born.<ref>{{cite news  author=  title=Daughter to Lou Costellos  url=https://www.nytimes.com/1947/08/16/archives/daughter-to-lou-costellos.html  quote=  newspaper=The New York Times  date=August 14, 1947 }}</ref>

==Career==
As a young man Costello was a great admirer of silent movie comedian Charlie Chaplin. In 1927 Costello hitchhiked to Hollywood to become an actor, but could only find work as a laborer or extra at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Bros. His athletic skill brought him occasional work as a Stunt performer stunt man, notably in The Trail of 98 (1928). He can also be spotted sitting ringside in the Laurel and Hardy film The Battle of the Century (1927).<ref name="laurelandhardyfilms">{{cite web url=http://laurelandhardyfilms.com/films/the-battle-of-the-century/associated/stills/all#/ title=Laurel &amp; Hardy Films &#124; Stills publisher=laurelandhardyfilms.com access-date=15 November 2014}}</ref>

===Burlesque and Bud Abbott===
In 1929, with the advent of talking pictures, he headed back east intending to get the requisite stage experience. He stopped in St. Joseph, Missouri and convinced a local American burlesque burlesque producer to hire him as a Dutch comic ("Dutch" was a corruption of "Deutsche", and the comic performed with a German accent). By the end of the year he was back in New York and soon began working in burlesque on the Mutual Burlesque wheel<ref name="Furmanek 1991">Furmanek, Bob and Ron Palumbo (1991). Abbott and Costello in Hollywood. New York: Perigee Books. {{ISBN 0-399-51605-0}}</ref> during the Great Depression.

After the Mutual Wheel collapsed, Costello went to work for the Minskys Burlesque Minskys, where he crossed paths with a talented producer and Double act straight man named Bud Abbott.<ref name="Furmanek 1991"/> In 1935 they first worked together at the Empire Theatre (42nd Street) Eltinge Theatre on 42nd Street in New York City when Costellos partner failed to show. Abbott and Costello formally teamed up in 1936.<ref name="Furmanek 1991"/>

Reportedly their first disagreement was over a booking in a minstrel show at the Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Costello wanted to take the gig, but Abbott was resistant. Costello offered to give Abbott a larger split of their salary, and Abbott agreed. Years later, in the flush of their Hollywood success, Costello reversed the salary split, 60-40 in his favor.{{citation needed date=October 2017}}

===Radio and Hollywood===
{{Refimprove section date=August 2017}}
Abbott and Costello were signed by the William Morris Agency William Morris talent agency, which succeeded in landing them featured roles and national exposure on The Kate Smith Hour, a popular variety show, in 1938. The teams signature routine, "Whos on First?", made its radio debut on Smiths show that year. Many of the teams sketches were further polished by John Grant (screenwriter) John Grant, who was hired soon after the team joined the radio show. They had their own program, The Abbott and Costello Show (radio program) The Abbott and Costello Show, on radio from 1942 to 1949.{{citation needed date=October 2017}}

Their success on the Smith program led to their appearance in a Broadway musical in 1939, The Streets of Paris. The following year they were signed to a movie contract with Universal Pictures.{{citation needed date=October 2017}}

They only had supporting roles in their first picture, One Night in the Tropics (1940), but stole the film with their classic routines, including a much-shortened version of "Whos On First?" (a more complete version was performed in The Naughty Nineties, released in 1945). The teams breakthrough picture, however, was Buck Privates, released early in 1941. They immediately became the No. 3 Box Office Stars of 1941.<ref name="Furmanek 1991"/>

===Fame and tragedy===
The duo made 36 films from 1940 to 1956, and were among the most popular and highest-paid entertainers in the world during World War II. Among their most popular films are Buck Privates, Hold That Ghost, Who Done It? (1942 film) Who Done It?, Pardon My Sarong, The Time of Their Lives, Buck Privates Come Home, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein and Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man.{{citation needed date=October 2017}}

The team also appeared on radio throughout the 1940s. On October 8, 1942, they launched their own weekly show on NBC, sponsored by Camel (cigarette) Camel cigarettes.{{citation needed date=October 2017}}

In the summer of 1942, the team went on a 35-day cross-country tour to promote and sell War Bonds. The Treasury Department credited them with the sale of $85 million in bonds.<ref name="Furmanek 1991"/>

In March 1943, after completing a winter tour of army bases, Costello had an attack of rheumatic fever and was unable to work for six months. On November 4 of that year he returned to the teams popular radio show, but a tragic event overshadowed his comeback. Upon arriving at the NBC studio, Lou received word that his infant son, Lou Jr., had accidentally drowned in the family pool.<ref name=stricken />  During an afternoon nap, the baby worked loose one of the slats on his crib, climbed out and fell into the pool, unnoticed by the nanny.<ref>Sherman, Eddie (Lous manager) interviewed on the program This is Your Life, NBC TV, presented by Ralph Edwards, 1956 (16:08), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWpEOXvnOmA, accessed January 20, 2014</ref> The baby (Little Butch) was just two days short of his first birthday. Lou had asked his wife to keep Butch up that night so the boy could hear his father on the radio for the first time. Rather than cancel the broadcast, Lou said, "Wherever he is tonight, I want him to hear me", and went on with the show. No one in the audience knew of the death until after the show when Bud Abbott explained the events of the day, and how the phrase "The show must go on" had been epitomized by Lou that night. Costellos close friend, Maxene Andrews of The Andrews Sisters, said that his entire demeanor changed after the tragic loss of his son, saying, "He didnt seem as fun-loving and as warm&nbsp;... He seemed to anger easily&nbsp;... there was a difference in his attitude."<ref>Sforza, John: Swing It! The Andrews Sisters Story; University Press of Kentucky, 2000; 289 pages.</ref>

Also in 1943 he was drafted into World War II and went to court to seek a deferment.<ref>{{cite news  author=  title=Lou Costello Called. His Draft Case Is Transferred From Paterson to Hollywood  url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/11/20/archives/lou-costello-called-his-draft-case-is-transferred-from-paterson-to.html  quote=  newspaper=The New York Times  date=November 20, 1943 }}</ref> It was about this time that serious cracks began to appear in the relationship between Abbott and Costello. In 1945, when Costello fired a domestic servant and Abbott hired her, Costello announced that he would no longer work with Abbott.<ref name="First, pp. 119-120">C. Costello (1961), pp. 119-120.</ref> However, they were still under contract to Universal and required to complete two movies in 1946.

Costello (1961), p. 120.</ref>{{citation needed date=September 2014}} Abbott reached out to heal their relationship, suggesting that the foundation he and Costello had founded for underprivileged children be named the Lou Costello Jr. Youth Foundation, which touched Costello deeply.<ref name="Furmanek 1991"/>

Their radio program moved to American Broadcasting Company ABC (the former NBC Blue Network) from 1947 to 1949. It was pre-recorded.{{citation needed date=October 2017}}

In 1951 the duo began to appear on live television, becoming one of the rotating hosts of The Colgate Comedy Hour (Eddie Cantor, Martin and Lewis and Bob Hope were among the others) and the following year they began their own filmed situation comedy, The Abbott and Costello Show. Costello owned the half-hour series, with Abbott working on salary. The show, which was loosely adapted from their radio program, ran for two seasons, from 1952 to 1954, but found long life in syndicated reruns.{{citation needed date=October 2017}}

===Abbott and Costello split===
By the mid-1950s Abbott and Costello films were no longer box-office gold, and after failing to come to terms with the team, Universal dropped their movie contract in 1955. With radio, film and television vehicles, they suffered from overexposure, and were eclipsed by the team of Martin and Lewis Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, who were the hot entertainment commodity that Abbott and Costello had been a decade earlier.{{citation needed date=October 2017}}

In 1956, after troubles with the Internal Revenue Service forced both men to sell their large homes and the rights to some of their films, Abbott and Costello made their final film together, an independent production called Dance with Me, Henry. The film was a box office bomb box-office disappointment and received mixed critical reviews{{according to whom date=May 2017}}.

Abbott and Costello dissolved their partnership in 1957 amicably.<ref>{{cite news  agency= United Press International  title=Abbott, Costello Split.

He appeared several times on Steve Allens fledgling The Tonight Show, but most often in variations of his old routines, with Louis Nye or Tom Poston taking on the straight man role.   Costello sought to be known as something other than the funny fat man in the baggy clothes, and in 1958, he played a dramatic role on The Tobias Jones Story episode of Wagon Train.<ref name="washburninterview">{{cite web last1=Fitzgerald first1=Mike title=Beverly Washburn Interview url=http://www.westernclippings.com/interview/beverlywashburn_interview.shtml website=Western Clippings.com publisher=Mike Fitzgerald accessdate=26 April 2018}}</ref>

File:Costello2.JPG thumb The Lou Costello statue in Paterson, New Jersey
On June 26, 1992, the city of Paterson, New Jersey, in conjunction with the Lou Costello Memorial Association, erected a statue of Costello in the newly named Lou Costello Memorial Park in the citys historic downtown section. It shows Costello holding a baseball bat, a reference to the teams most famous routine, "Whos on First?". The statue has had brief appearances in two episodes of The Sopranos: "Big Girls Dont Cry (The Sopranos) Big Girls Dont Cry" and "Cold Stones". The statue and the "Whos on First?" routine also featured in the 2016 film Paterson (film) Paterson. In 2005, Madison Street, in the Sandy Hill, Paterson Sandy Hill section of Paterson, where Costello was born, was renamed Lou Costello Place.{{citation needed date=October 2017}}

The centennial of Costellos birth was celebrated in Paterson on the first weekend in March 2006.  From June 24 to June 26, 2006, the Fort Lee, New Jersey Fort Lee Film Commission held a centennial film retrospective at the Fine Arts Theatre in Hollywood.
