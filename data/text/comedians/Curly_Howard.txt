Jerome Lester Horwitz (October 22, 1903 – January 18, 1952), known professionally as Curly Howard, was an United States American vaudeville vaudevillian actor and comedian. He was best known as a member of the American farce comedy team the Three Stooges, which also featured his elder brothers Moe Howard Moe and Shemp Howard and actor Larry Fine. Curly Howard was generally considered the most popular and recognizable of the Stooges. He was well known for his high-pitched voice and vocal expressions ("nyuk-nyuk-nyuk!", "woob-woob-woob!", "soitenly!" [certainly], and barking like a dog) as well as his physical comedy (e.g., falling on the ground and pivoting on his shoulder as he "walked" in circular motion), improvisations, and athleticism.
An untrained actor, Curly borrowed (and significantly exaggerated) the "woob woob" from "nervous" and soft-spoken comedian Hugh Herbert.
Curlys unique version of "woob-woob-woob" was firmly established by the time of the Stooges second Columbia film, Punch Drunks (1934).
Howard was forced to leave the Three Stooges act in 1946 when a massive stroke ended his show business career. He suffered through serious health problems and several more strokes until his death in 1952 at age 48.

==Early life==
Curly Howard was born Jerome Lester Horwitz in the Bensonhurst, Brooklyn Bensonhurst section of the Brooklyn borough of New York City, on October 22, 1903. Of Lithuanian Jews Lithuanian Jewish ancestry, he was the youngest of the five sons of Jennie (Gorovitz) and Solomon Horwitz. Because he was the youngest, his brothers called him "Babe" to tease him. The name "Babe" stuck with him all his life, although when his elder brother Shemp Howard married Gertrude Frank, who was also nicknamed "Babe", the brothers called him "Curly" to avoid confusion.
His full formal Hebrew language Hebrew name was "Yehudah Lev ben Shlomo Natan ha Levi."
A quiet child, Howard rarely caused problems for his parents (something older brothers Moe Howard Moe and Shemp Howard Shemp excelled in). He was a mediocre student but excelled as an athlete on the school basketball team. He didnt graduate from high school, and instead he kept himself busy with odd jobs and constantly following his older brothers, whom he idolized. He was also an accomplished ballroom dancer and singer and regularly turned up at the Triangle Ballroom in Brooklyn, occasionally bumping into George Raft.
When Howard was 12, he accidentally shot himself in the left ankle while cleaning a rifle. Moe rushed him to the hospital and saved his life. The wound resulted in a noticeably thinner left leg and a slight limp. He was so frightened of surgery that he never had the limp corrected. While with the Stooges, he developed his famous exaggerated walk to mask the limp on screen.
Howard was interested in music and comedy and would watch his brothers Shemp and Moe perform as stooges in Ted Healys vaudeville act. He also liked to hang around backstage, although he never participated in any of the routines.

==Career==

===Early career and the Three Stooges===
From an early age, Howard was always "in demand socially," as brother Moe put it.
He married his first wife, Julia Rosenthal, on August 5, 1930, but the couple had their marriage annulled shortly afterwards.
Howards first on-stage break was as a comedy musical conductor in 1928 for the Orville Knapp Band. Moe later recalled that his performances usually overshadowed those of the band.
Though he enjoyed the gig, he watched as older brothers Moe and Shemp (and partner Larry Fine) made it big as some of Ted Healys "Double act Stooges." Vaudeville star Healy had a very popular stage act, in which he would try to tell jokes or sing, only to have his stooges wander on stage and interrupt or heckle him and cause disturbances from the audience. Meanwhile, Healy and company appeared in their first feature film, Rube Goldbergs Soup to Nuts (1930).
Shemp Howard, however, disliked Healys abrasiveness, bad temper, and heavy drinking.
In 1932, he was offered a contract at the Vitaphone Studios in Brooklyn. (Contrary to stories told by Moe, the role of "Knobby Walsh" in the Joe Palooka series did not come along until late 1935, after Shemp had been at Vitaphone for three years and had already appeared in almost thirty short subjects.) Shemp was thrilled to be away from Healy but, as was his nature, worried incessantly about brother Moe and partner Larry. Moe, however, told Shemp to pursue this opportunity.

With Shemp gone, Moe suggested that Curly fill the role of the third Stooge. But Healy felt that, with his thick, chestnut hair and elegant waxed mustache, he did not "look funny" and was "too handsome". Howard left the room and returned minutes later with his head shaven (the mustache remained very briefly). Healy quipped, "Boy, dont you look girlie?" Moe misheard the joke as "curly", and all who witnessed the exchange realized that the nickname "Curly" would be a perfect fit. In one of the few interviews Howard gave in his lifetime, he complained about the loss of his hair: "I had to shave it off right down to the skin."
In 1934, MGM was building Healy up as a solo comedian in feature films and Healy dissolved the act to pursue his own career. Like Shemp, the team of Howard, Fine, and Howard was tired of Healys alcoholism and abrasiveness and renamed their act the "Three Stooges." That same year, they signed on to appear in two-reel comedy short subjects for Columbia Pictures. The Stooges soon became the most popular short-subject attraction, with Howard playing an integral part in the trios work.

Howards childlike mannerisms and natural comedic charm made him a hit with audiences, particularly children. He was known in the act for having an "indestructible" head, which always won out by breaking anything that assaulted it, including saws (resulting in his characteristic quip, "Oh, look!"). Although having no formal acting training, his comedic skills were exceptional. Many times, directors would simply let the camera roll freely and let Howard improvise. Jules White, in particular, would leave gaps in the Stooge scripts where he could improvise for several minutes.
In later years, White commented: "If we wrote a scene and needed a little something extra, Id say to Curly, Look, weve got a gap to fill this in with a "woob-woob" or some other bit of business. And he never disappointed us."
By the time the Stooges hit their peak in the late 1930s, their films had almost become vehicles for Howards unbridled comic performances. Classics like A Plumbing We Will Go (1940), We Want Our Mummy (1938), An Ache in Every Stake (1941), Cactus Makes Perfect (film) Cactus Makes Perfect (1942), and their most violent short, They Stooge to Conga (1943), display his ability to take inanimate objects (like food, tools, pipes, etc.) and turn them into ingenious comic props.
Moe Howard later confirmed that when Curly forgot his lines, that merely allowed him to improvise on the spot so that the "take" could continue uninterrupted:

{{cquote If we were going through a scene and hed forget his words for a moment, you know, rather than stand, get pale and stop, you never knew what he was going to do. On one occasion hed get down to the floor and spin around like a top until he remembered what he had to say.
}}

Howard also developed a set of reactions and expressions that the other Stooges would imitate long after hed left the act:
Many of these were spoken in a form of New York accent.
* "Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk" – Curly Howards traditional laughter, accompanied by manic finger-snapping, often used to amuse himself;
* "Woob, woob, woob!" – used when he was either scared, dazed, or flirting with a "dame";
* "Hmmm!" – an under-the-breath, high-pitched sound meant to show different emotions, including interest, excitement, frustration, or anger; one of his most-used reactions/expressions;
* "Nyahh-ahhh-ahhh!" – scared reaction (this was the reaction most often used by the other Stooges after Howards departure);
* "Laaa-Deeeeeee" or simply "Laaa, laaa, laaa" – his working "song"; also used when he was acting innocently right before taking out an enemy;
* "Ruff Ruff" – dog bark, used to give an enemy a final push before departing the scene, or barking at an attractive dame;
* "Ha-cha-cha-cha-cha!" – a take on Jimmy Durantes famed call, used more sparingly than other expressions;
* "Im a victim of soicumstance [circumstance]";
* "Soiteny!" ("certainly");
* "Ill moider you!" ("Ill murder you!"; used as a threat, but much more by Moe than by Curly);
* "Huff huff huff!" – sharp, huffing exhales either due to excitement or meant to provoke a foe;
* "Ah-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!" – used during his later years, a sort of nonsense, high-pitched yelling that signified being scared or overly excited;
* "Indubitably" – an expression used to feign an intelligent response;
* His teeth, while chattering nervously, made the sound of a small hammer striking a chisel;
* "A WISE Guy, Eh?" – annoyed response;
* "Oh Look!" – surprised remark, usually about a common object;
* "Say a coupla adjectives!" – to another (injured) stooge, usually Moe.
* Occasionally, the Stooges faced a problem that required deep thought; whereupon Curly would bang his head on a wall several times, then shout, "I got it!  I got it!"   Moe would ask, "What have you got?"  Curlys answer: "A terrific headache." 
* Despite his mispronunciations, he had an uncanny ability to instantly spell big words, such as "chrysanthemum", if asked. The gag was that Curly never did it, when something important was at stake. In one scene, the Stooges were in a situation where this talent might have landed them a job, but Curly had missed his opportunity. Moes reaction would be to growl, "Where were you a minute ago?" and then smack him.

On several occasions, Moe Howard was convinced that rising star Lou Costello (a close friend of Shemp) was stealing material from his brother.
