Hawn moved to California to dance in a show at a theater across from Disneyland.<ref name=interviewmag2017/> Hawn began her acting career as a cast member of the short-lived CBS situation comedy Good Morning, World during the 1967–68 television season, her role being that of the girlfriend of a radio disc jockey, with a stereotypical "dumb blonde" personality.<ref name=actors/>

Her next role, which brought her to international attention, was as one of the regular cast members on the 1968–1973 sketch comedy show, Rowan & Martins Laugh-In. On the show, she would often break out into high-pitched giggles in the middle of a joke, and deliver a polished performance a moment after. Noted equally for her chipper attitude as for her bikini and painted body, Hawn was seen as something of a 1960s It girl "It" girl.<ref>{{cite magazine   last=Heyman   first=Marshall   date=May 17, 2017   title=Solid Goldie: Goldie Hawn Is Back and Better Than Ever   work=Harpers Bazaar   url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a9661481/goldie-hawn-interview/   access-date=March 21, 2018}}</ref>

Hawn had made her feature film debut in a bit role as a giggling dancer in the 1968 film The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band, in which she was billed as "Goldie Jeanne", but in her first major film role, in Cactus Flower (1969), she won an Academy Award for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress Best Supporting Actress as Walter Matthaus suicidal fiancée.

She starred in a string of above average and successful comedies starting with Theres a Girl in My Soup (1970), $ (film) $ (1971), and Butterflies Are Free (1972). She continued proving herself in the dramatic league with the 1974 satirical dramas The Girl from Petrovka and The Sugarland Express, and Shampoo (film) Shampoo in 1975. She also hosted two television specials: Pure Goldie in 1971 and The Goldie Hawn Special in 1978.

On the special she performed show tunes and comedy bits alongside comic legend George Burns, teen matinee idol Shaun Cassidy, television star John Ritter (during his days on Threes Company), and even the Harlem Globetrotters joined her for a montage. The special later went on to be nominated for a primetime Emmy.

The plot centered around an innocent woman in San Francisco who becomes mixed up in an assassination plot.

Hawns next film, Mario Monicellis Lovers and Liars (1979), was a box office bomb. In 1972 Hawn recorded and released a solo country LP for Warner Brothers, titled Goldie. It was recorded with the help of Dolly Parton and Buck Owens. AllMusic gives the album a favorable review, calling it a "sweetly endearing country-tinged middle of the road pop record".<ref name="amg_record_review">{{cite web url={{Allmusic class=album id=r574832/review pure_url=yes}} title=Goldie: Review last=Mason first=Stewart publisher=AllMusic accessdate=November 2, 2009}}</ref>
