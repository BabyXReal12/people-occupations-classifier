==Early life==

{{Failed verification date=May 2018 reason=from Leeds and age 44, but no mention of Beeston and no birth date given}} and brought up on a council house council estate in Old Farnley, Leeds. His father died aged 47 of cancer.
Francis attended Farnley Park High School (now The Farnley Academy). He later studied at the Leeds College of Art and received a qualification in graphic design. Before making his major television breakthrough, he was discovered and encouraged by television presenter Davina McCall, performing in-role stand-up comedy in a southern comedy club.

McCall landed Francis his first television role on Dom and Kirks Nite O Plenty, where he portrayed Bobby Stark, a man who gives tips on how to win over the ladies. The series aired on Comedy Central (UK and Ireland) Paramount Television from January to July 1996. Francis second television role was as Barry Gibson, a music Paparazzi paparazzo, featured on the early series of Channel 4s Popworld. Francis also starred as various characters, including Gibson, Keith Lemon and Avid Merrion in the series Whatever I Want, which aired late night on ITV in 2000.

==Career==
In his early career, Francis did a series of shorts for Paramount Comedy called Stars in Their Houses. Some of the shorts can be found on YouTube.

His major television breakthrough occurred when Channel 4 offered him a £250,000 deal to produce a series based on his television characters, such as his previous roles as Bobby Stark and Barry Gibson, and in 2002, Bo Selecta! was born. The series featured Francis portraying a series of celebrities by wearing face masks to impersonate them, as well as portraying the main, non-celebrity character, Avid Merrion. The programme lasted for five series, airing between 2002 and 2006, however, the last two series were only loosely based on the original three. Season 4 was subtitled List of Bo Selecta! episodes#Series 4 A Bears Tail, and was based on another of his characters, List of Bo Selecta! characters#The Bear The Bear. Season 5 returned to Avid Merrion and was called List of Bo Selecta! episodes#Series Five Bo! in the USA.

Following the axing of Bo Selecta!, Francis took one of the series characters, Keith Lemon, and created a brand new show, Keith Lemons Very Brilliant World Tour, which aired on ITV2 in April 2008. The show was a success, and subsequently, Francis created another new show featuring Lemon, Celebrity Juice, which has aired 19 series to date. Lemon also co-hosted Sing If You Can with Stacey Solomon, and, since 7 April 2012, he has hosted his new show Keith Lemons LemonAid on ITV. In November 2011, it was revealed that Lemon would make his feature film debut in Keith Lemon: The Film, with production starting later that month.
Since 31 August 2013, Francis has presented ITV panel show Through the Keyhole in character as Keith Lemon. Since 5 February 2015, he has appeared in the ITV2 comedy show The Keith Lemon Sketch Show.

==Personal life==
On 30 October 2002, at Allerton Castle, North Yorkshire, Francis married Jill Carter, a beauty therapist. In February 2009, their daughter, Matilda, was born.
The couple also have another daughter, Dolly.
Francis lives in North London with his wife and daughters.

==Characterisation==
In interviews, Francis usually adopts one of his celebrity guises, being interviewed as Avid Merrion during Bo Selecta!s run between 2002 and 2006, and as Keith Lemon ever since. In an out-of-character interview with On: Yorkshire Magazine, Francis confirmed Avid Merrions accent and dialects were inspired by his former tutor at Leeds College of Art Jacob Kramer College, Laimonis Mieriņš. He also pointed out Merrion is a misspelling of Mieriņš, and has nothing to do with the Merrion Centre, Leeds Merrion Centre in Leeds as some may have assumed.
Francis has also been interviewed as himself for The Frank Skinner Show, Loose Women, Big Brothers Little Brother, The Museum of Curiosity and Friday Night with Jonathan Ross.
