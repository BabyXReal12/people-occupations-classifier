On both the radio and television versions of The Morey Amsterdam Show (1948–50), Carneys character Charlie the doorman became known for his catchphrase, "Ya know what I mean?"

In 1950, Jackie Gleason was starring in a New York–based comedy-variety series, Cavalcade of Stars, and played many different characters. Gleasons regular characters included Charlie Bratten, a lunchroom loudmouth who insisted on spoiling a neighboring patrons meal. Carney, established in New York as a reliable actor, played Brattens mild-mannered victim, Clem Finch. Gleason and Carney developed a good working chemistry, and Gleason recruited Carney to appear in other sketches, including the domestic-comedy skits featuring The Honeymooners. Carney gained lifelong fame for his portrayal of sewer worker Ed Norton, opposite Jackie Gleasons Ralph Kramden. The success of these skits resulted in the famous filmed situation comedy The Honeymooners, and the Honeymooners revivals that followed. He was nominated for seven Emmy Awards and won six.

On August 13, 1970, Elvis Presley recalled meeting Carney in early 1956, when Presley was appearing on Jackie Gleasons Stage Show (TV series).
