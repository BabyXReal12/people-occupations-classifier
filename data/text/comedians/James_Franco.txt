Franco has deliberately garnered a reputation for publishing "selfies" (self-shot photos of oneself, alone or with others) and wrote an explanatory article for The New York Times in December 2013. Franco writes:

<blockquote>But a well-stocked collection of selfies seems to get attention. And attention seems to be the name of the game when it comes to social networking. In this age of too much information at a click of a button, the power to attract viewers amid the sea of things to read and watch is power indeed. Its what the movie studios want for their products, its what professional writers want for their work, its what newspapers want — hell, its what everyone wants: attention.

In other forms of media, a Chicago-based theater company, Under the Gun Theater, developed a show inspired by and titled after Franco. The 2015 production of Dear James Franco used, parodied and deconstructed letters penned to or by celebrities.

==Personal life==
===Religion===
Franco has described himself as Jewish;<ref name="bostonref1"/> regarding his secular upbringing, he told The Guardian that he feels as if he has "missed out on the Jewish experience", but has been told not to worry about that by his Jewish friends and said in the same interview that he likes "the idea of religion as a source of community". When asked if he was a "believer", he responded, "In God? I dont know. Yes. To a certain extent. Its a complicated question."<ref name="niadraug"/> In 2015, he had an official Bar and Bat Mitzvah Bar Mitzvah ceremony, presided over by a rabbi.<ref>{{cite web first=Esther D. last=Kustanowitz url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywood/article/james_francos_bar_mitzvah_spectacular title=James Francos bar mitzvah spectacular work=The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles publisher=TRIBE Media Corp location=Los Angeles, California date=October 20, 2015 access-date=December 8, 2017}}</ref>

===Relationships===
Due to his support for the LGBT community, and his portrayal of gay characters in his projects, Francos sexuality has been a subject of discussion in media sources, relentlessly questioning if he himself is gay. In response to questions regarding his sexuality, he insists he finds plenty more dimensions to the characters than their bedroom proclivities. "Or, you know what," he quipped, "maybe Im just gay."<ref>{{cite news first=Matt last=Donnelly title=James Francos Maybe Im just gay- and why we love it url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2011/01/james-franco-gay.html newspaper=Los Angeles Times  publisher=Tronc location=Los Angeles, California date=January 7, 2011 access-date=January 8, 2011}}</ref> In a March 2015 interview with Four Two Nine magazine, Franco again opened up about his sexuality, commenting that it is not who you have sex with that defines your sexuality, but instead how you act. "In the twenties and thirties, they used to define homosexuality by how you acted and not by whom you slept with. Sailors would fuck guys all the time, but as long as they behaved in masculine ways, they werent considered gay." He added, "Well, I like to think that Im gay in my art and straight in my life."<ref>{{cite web first=Nick last=Duffy title=James Franco opens up about his sexuality url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/03/18/james-franco-opens-up-about-his-sexuality/ website=PinkNews  date=March 18, 2015 access-date=March 19, 2015}}</ref>
