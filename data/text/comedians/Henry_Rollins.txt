After performing in the short-lived Washington, D.C. band State of Alert in 1980, Rollins fronted the California hardcore punk band Black Flag (band) Black Flag from August 1981 until mid-1986. Following the bands breakup, Rollins established the record label and publishing company 2.13.61 to release his spoken word albums, and formed the Rollins Band, which toured with a number of lineups from 1987 until 2003, and during 2006.

Since Black Flag disbanded, Rollins has hosted numerous radio shows, such as Harmony in My Head on Indie 103, and television shows such as The Henry Rollins Show, MTVs 120 Minutes, and Jackass (TV series) Jackass. He had recurring dramatic roles in the second season of Sons of Anarchy, in the final seasons of the animated series The Legend of Korra as Zaheer (The Legend of Korra) Zaheer, and has also had roles in several films. Rollins has campaigned for various political causes in the United States, including promoting LGBT rights in the United States LGBT rights, World Hunger Relief, the West Memphis Three and an Peace movement end to war in particular.

==Music career==

===State of Alert===
{{Main State of Alert}}
After high school, Rollins attended American University in Washington D.C. for one semester, but dropped out in December 1979.<ref name="latimes"/><ref>{{cite web  url=http://dailyuw.com/news/1996/nov/27/an-interview-with-henry-rollins/  title=An Interview With Henry Rollins &#124; The Daily  publisher=Dailyuw.com  date=1996-11-27  accessdate=2012-10-31  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708041440/http://dailyuw.com/news/1996/nov/27/an-interview-with-henry-rollins/  archivedate=July 8, 2012  df=mdy-all }}</ref> He began working minimum-wage jobs, including a job as a courier for kidney samples at the National Institutes of Health.<ref name="popenter">{{cite web  url=http://www.popentertainment.com/henryrollins.htm  title=Henry Rollins interview  accessdate=2007-08-14  author=Sklar, Ronald  publisher=PopEntertainment.com}}</ref> Rollins developed an interest in punk rock after he and his friend Ian MacKaye procured a copy of The Ramones eponymous Ramones (album) debut album; he later described it as "akin to shooting heroin." From 1979 to 1980, Rollins was working as a roadie for Washington bands, including Teen Idles. When the bands singer Nathan Strejcek failed to appear for practice sessions, Rollins convinced the Teen Idles to let him sing. Word of Rollinss ability spread around the punk rock scene in Washington; Bad Brains singer H.R. would sometimes get Rollins on stage to sing with him.<ref name="a26">Azerrad, 2001. p. 26</ref>

In 1980, the Washington punk band the Extorts lost their frontman Lyle Preslar to Minor Threat. Rollins joined the others of the band to form State of Alert (S.O.A.), and became its frontman and vocalist. He put words to the bands five songs and wrote several more. S.O.A. recorded their sole EP, No Policy, and released it in 1981 on MacKayes Dischord Records.<ref>{{cite web  url={{Allmusic class=artist id=p442659 pure_url=yes}}  title=State of Alert > Overview  accessdate=2007-08-16  author=DePasquale, Ron  publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> S.O.A. disbanded after a total of a dozen concerts and one EP. Rollins had enjoyed being the bands frontman, and had earned a reputation for fighting in shows. He later said, "I was like nineteen and a young man all full of steam and loved to get in the dust-ups." By this time, Rollins had become the assistant manager of the Georgetown Häagen-Dazs ice cream store; his steady employment had helped to finance the S.O.A. EP.<ref name="a27">Azerrad, 2001. p. 27</ref>

===Black Flag===
{{Main Black Flag (band)}}

In 1980, a friend gave Rollins and MacKaye a copy of Black Flags Nervous Breakdown (EP) Nervous Breakdown EP. Rollins soon became a fan of the band, exchanging letters with bassist Chuck Dukowski and later inviting the band to stay in his parents home when Black Flag toured the East Coast in December 1980.<ref>Azzerad, 2001. p. 27-28</ref> When Black Flag returned to the East Coast in 1981, Rollins attended as many of their concerts as he could. At an impromptu show in a New York bar, Black Flags vocalist Dez Cadena allowed Rollins to sing "Clocked In", a song Rollins had asked the band to play in light of the fact that he had to drive back to Washington, D.C. to begin work.<ref name="a28">Azerrad, 2001. p. 28</ref>

Unbeknownst to Rollins, Cadena wanted to switch to guitar, and the band was looking for a new vocalist.<ref name="a28" /> The band was impressed with Rollins singing and stage demeanor, and the next day, after a semi-formal audition at Tu Casa Studio in New York City, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist. Despite some doubts, he accepted, in part because of MacKayes encouragement. His high level of energy and intense personality suited the bands style, but Rollins diverse tastes in music were a key factor in his being selected as singer; Black Flags founder Greg Ginn was growing restless creatively and wanted a singer who was willing to move beyond simple, three-chord punk.<ref name="a29">Azerrad, 2001. p. 29</ref>

After joining Black Flag in 1981, Rollins quit his job at Häagen-Dazs, sold his car, and moved to Los Angeles. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Rollins got the Black Flag logo tattooed on his left biceps<ref name="popenter" /> and also on the back of his neck, chose the stage name of Rollins, a surname he and MacKaye had used as teenagers.<ref name="a29" /> Rollins played his first show with Black Flag on August 21, 1981 at Cuckoos Nest in Costa Mesa, California.<ref>{{cite web title=Black Flag at the Cuckoos Nest url=http://www.itallhappened.com/black-flag-at-the-cuckoos-nest-1981-08-21 work=It All Happened - A Living History of Live Music deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101030125/http://www.itallhappened.com/black-flag-at-the-cuckoos-nest-1981-08-21 archivedate=January 1, 2016 df=mdy-all}}</ref> Rollins was in a different environment in Los Angeles; the police soon realized he was a member of Black Flag, and he was hassled as a result. Rollins later said: "That really scared me. It freaked me out that an adult would do that. [...] My little eyes were opened big time."<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 31</ref>

Before concerts, as the others of the band tuned up, Rollins would stride about the stage dressed only in a pair of black shorts, grinding his teeth; to focus before the show, he would squeeze a pool ball.<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 34</ref> His stage persona impressed several critics; after a 1982 show in Anacortes, Washington, Sub Pop critic Calvin Johnson (musician) Calvin Johnson wrote: "Henry was incredible. Pacing back and forth, lunging, lurching, growling; it was all real, the most intense emotional experiences I have ever seen."<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 38</ref>

By 1983, Rollins stage persona was increasingly alienating him from the rest of Black Flag. During a show in England, Rollins assaulted a member of the audience who attacked Ginn; Ginn later scolded Rollins, calling him a "macho asshole".<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 39</ref> A legal dispute with Unicorn Records held up further Black Flag releases until 1984, and Ginn was slowing the bands tempo down so that they would remain innovative. In August 1983, guitarist Dez Cadena had left the band; a stalemate lingered between Dukowski and Ginn, who wanted Dukowski to leave, before Ginn fired Dukowski outright.<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 41</ref> 1984s heavy metal music-influenced My War featured Rollins screaming and wailing throughout many of the songs; the bands members also grew their hair to confuse the bands hardcore punk audience.<ref name="a47">Azerrad, 2001. p. 47</ref>

Black Flags change in musical style and appearance alienated many of their original fans, who focused their displeasure on Rollins by punching him in the mouth, stabbing him with pens, or scratching him with their nails, among other methods. He often fought back, dragging audience members on stage and assaulting them. During a Black Flag concert, Rollins repeatedly punched a fan in the face who had continuously reached for his microphone.<ref>{{cite web last1=Reilly first1=Dan title=10 Concert Fights Caught on Tape url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/10-concert-fights-caught-on-tape-20130625 website=Rolling Stone accessdate=23 January 2015}}</ref> Rollins became increasingly alienated from the audience; in his tour diary, Rollins wrote "When they spit at me, when they grab at me, they arent hurting me. When I push out and mangle the flesh of another, its falling so short of what I really want to do to them."<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 46</ref> During the Unicorn legal dispute, Rollins had started a weight-lifting program, and by their 1984 tours, he had become visibly well-built; journalist Michael Azerrad later commented that "his powerful physique was a metaphor for the impregnable emotional shield he was developing around himself."<ref name="a47" /> <!-- Get in the Van book release? --> Rollins has since replied that "no, the training was just basically a way to push myself."<ref name="smhinterview">{{cite news  url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/henry-rollins/2008/04/03/1206851089537.html  title=Henry Rollins interview  accessdate=2008-04-04  author=Jensen, Erik work=Sydney Morning Herald   date=2008-04-03}}</ref>

Before Black Flag disbanded in August 1986, Rollins had already toured as a solo spoken word artist.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2003-01-08/music/lip-service.php  title=Lip Service – Henry Rollins  accessdate=2007-09-14  author=Waggoner, Eric  publisher=Seattle Weekly  archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014220714/http://seattleweekly.com/2003-01-08/music/lip-service.php  archivedate = October 14, 2007}}</ref> He released two solo records in 1987, Hot Animal Machine, a collaboration with guitarist Chris Haskett, and Drive by Shooting, recorded as "Henrietta Collins and the Wifebeating Childhaters";<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.shsu.edu/~lis_fwh/book/punk_newwave_postpunk/support/Rollins.htm  title=Henry Rollins/Black Flag  accessdate=2007-09-09  author=Hoffmann, Frank  publisher=Survey of American Popular Music}}</ref> Rollins also released his second spoken word album, Big Ugly Mouth in the same year. Along with Haskett, Rollins soon added Andrew Weiss (guitarist) Andrew Weiss and Sim Cain, both former members of Ginns side-project Gone (band) Gone, and called the new group Rollins Band. The band toured relentlessly,<ref name="amgrollins">{{cite web  url={{Allmusic class=artist id=p191773 pure_url=yes}}  title=Rollins Band > Biography  accessdate=2007-08-22  author=Prato, Greg  publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> and their 1987 debut album, Life Time (Rollins Band album) Life Time, was quickly followed by the outtakes and live collection Do It. The band continued to tour throughout 1988; in 1989 another Rollins Band album, Hard Volume was released.<ref name="amghenry">{{cite web  url={{Allmusic class=artist id=p5299 pure_url=yes}}  title=Henry Rollins > Biography  accessdate=2007-08-22  author=Huey, Steve  publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> Another live album, Turned On, and another spoken word release, Live at McCabes, followed in 1990.

In 1991, the Rollins Band signed a distribution deal with Imago Records and appeared at the Lollapalooza festival; both improved the bands presence. However, in December 1991, Rollins and his best friend Joe Cole (roadie) Joe Cole were accosted by two armed robbers outside Rollinss home. Cole was murdered by a gunshot to the head, Rollins escaped without injury but police suspected him in the murder and detained him for ten hours.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.edwebproject.org/rollins.html  title=Primal Scream: Henry Rollins speaks  accessdate=2007-09-08  author1=Carvin, Andy  author2=Crone, Chris  publisher=EdWebProject.org}}</ref> Although traumatized by Coles death, as chronicled in his book Now Watch Him Die, Rollins continued to release new material; the spoken-word album Human Butt appeared in 1992 on his own record label, 2.13.61. The Rollins Band released The End of Silence, Rollinss first charting album.<ref name="amghenry" />

The following year, Rollins released a spoken-word double album, The Boxed Life.<ref>{{cite web  url={{Allmusic class=album id=r77934 pure_url=yes}}  title=The Boxed Life > Overview  accessdate=2007-08-23  author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas  publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> The Rollins Band embarked upon the End of Silence tour; bassist Weiss was fired towards its end and replaced by funk and jazz bassist Melvin Gibbs. According to critic Steve Huey, 1994 was Rollinss "breakout year".<ref name="amghenry" /> The Rollins Band appeared at Woodstock 94 and released Weight (album) Weight, which ranked on the Billboard Top 40. Rollins released Get in the Van Get in the Van: On the Road with Black Flag, a double-disc set of him reading from his Black Flag tour diary of the same name; he won the Grammy for Best Spoken Word Recording as a result. Rollins was named 1994s "Man of the Year" by the American mens magazine Details (magazine) Details and became a contributing columnist to the magazine. With the increased exposure, Rollins made several appearances on American music channels MTV and VH1 around this time, and made his Hollywood film debut in 1994 in The Chase (1994 film) The Chase playing a police officer.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800022646/bio  title=Henry Rollins Biography  accessdate=2007-09-14  publisher=Yahoo! Movies}}</ref>

In 1995, the Rollins Bands record label, Imago Records, declared itself bankrupt. Rollins began focusing on his spoken word career. He released Everything, a recording of a chapter of his book Eye Scream with free jazz backing, in 1996. He continued to appear in various films, including Heat (1995 film) Heat, Johnny Mnemonic (film) Johnny Mnemonic and Lost Highway (film) Lost Highway. The Rollins Band signed to Dreamworks Records in 1997 and soon released Come in and Burn, but it did not receive as much critical acclaim as their previous material. Rollins continued to release spoken-word book readings, releasing Black Coffee Blues in the same year. In 1998, Rollins released Think Tank (Rollins) Think Tank, his first set of non-book-related spoken material in five years.

By 1998, Rollins felt that the relationship with his backing band had run its course, and the line-up disbanded. He had produced a Los Angeles hard rock band called Mother Superior (band) Mother Superior, and invited them to form a new incarnation of the Rollins Band. Their first album, Get Some Go Again, was released two years later. The Rollins Band released several more albums, including 2001s Nice (Rollins Band album) Nice and 2003s Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three. After 2003, the band became inactive as Rollins focused on radio and television work. During a 2006 appearance on Tom Greens House Tonight Tom Green Live!, Rollins stated that he "may never do music again",<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=61600  title=Henry Rollins on Tom Green Live  date=November 5, 2006  publisher=Blabbermouth.net  accessdate=2010-01-19  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606064937/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=61600  archivedate=June 6, 2011  df= }}</ref> a feeling which he reiterated in 2011 when talking to Trebuchet magazine.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/index.php/site/article/henry_rollins_Student_protests_are_great/ title=Henry Rollins:Student Protests are Great date=January 11, 2011 publisher=Trebuchet Magazine accessdate=2011-01-05}}</ref> In an interview with Culture Brats, Rollins admitted he had sworn off music for good – "... and I must say that I miss it every day.

In 2014, Rollins admitted a disdain for rehashing old music for the sake of it - "I dont want to play old music. To me, it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, I see no courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again. If others want to, thats for them. For myself, I have to move on. Life is too short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.commdiginews.com/entertainment/exclusive-interview-henry-rollins-speaks-about-punk-rock-19402/#BWirroYp4ESgox7S.99 title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Henry Rollins speaks about punk rock author=Kevin Wells publisher=Commdiginews.com accessdate=January 18, 2015}}</ref> On the same topic, Rollins more recently said in 2016 "For me, music was a time and a place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. One day, I woke up, and I didnt have any more lyrics. I just had nothing to contribute to the form, and I was done with band practice and traveling in groups." <ref>{{cite web author=Joe Goggins  url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/interviews/the-last-word-henry-rollins  title=Henry Rollins on touring, spoken word & nostalgia  publisher=The Skinny  date=2016-01-08  accessdate=2017-03-04}}</ref>

Rollins is a guest star on Damian Cowells 2017 album Get Yer Dag On!.

===Musical style===
As a vocalist, Rollins has adopted a number of styles through the years. He was noted in the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene for what journalist Michael Azerrad described as a "compelling, raspy howl."<ref name="a26" /> With State of Alert, Rollins "spat out the lyrics like a bellicose auctioneer."<ref name="a27" /> He adopted a similar style after joining Black Flag in 1981. By their album Damaged (Black Flag album) Damaged, however, Black Flag began to incorporate a Swung note swing beat into their style. Rollins then abandoned his State of Alert "bark" and adopted the bands swing.<ref name="a32">Azerrad, 2001. p. 32</ref> Rollins later explained: "What I was doing kind of matched the vibe of the music. The music was intense and, well, I was as intense as you needed."<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 33</ref>

In both incarnations of the Rollins Band, Rollins combined spoken word with his traditional vocal style in songs such as "Liar (Rollins Band song) Liar" (the song begins with a one-minute spoken diatribe by Rollins), barked his way through songs (such as "Tearing" and "Starve"), and employed the loud-quiet dynamic. Rolling Stone<nowiki></nowiki>s Anthony DeCurtis names Rollins a "screeching hate machine" and his "hallmark" as "the sheets-of-sound assault".<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/234867/review/5941451/get_some_go_again  title=Rollins Band: Get Some Go Again  accessdate=2007-09-20  author=DeCurtis, Anthony  work=Rolling Stone  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012173915/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/234867/review/5941451/get_some_go_again  archivedate=October 12, 2007  deadurl=no  df=mdy }}</ref>

With the Rollins Band, his lyrics focused "almost exclusively on issues relating to personal integrity," according to critic Geoffrey Welchman.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/118204/review/5943481/weight  title=Rollins Band: Weight  accessdate=2007-09-20  author=Welchman, Geoffrey  work=Rolling Stone  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012173910/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rollinsband/albums/album/118204/review/5943481/weight  archivedate=October 12, 2007  deadurl=no  df=mdy }}</ref>

===As producer===
In the 1980s, Rollins produced an album of acoustic songs for the famed convict Charles Manson titled Completion. The record was supposed to be released by SST Records, but the project was canceled because the label received death threats for working with Manson. Only five test presses of Completion were pressed, two of which remain in Rollins possession.

==Joe Cole Murder, 1991==
Rollins and his best friend Murder of Joe Cole Joe Cole, son of actor Dennis Cole, were involved in a shooting when they were assaulted by robbers in December 1991 outside their shared Venice, Los Angeles Venice Beach, California, home. Cole died after being shot in the face, but Rollins escaped.<ref name=LAT>{{cite web url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-02/entertainment/ca-151_1_henry-rollins  title=Singer-Poet Henry Rollins Fuels His Art With Rage - Los Angeles Times  publisher=Articles.latimes.com  date=1999-01-12  accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> The murder remains unsolved.

In an April 1992 Los Angeles Times interview, Rollins revealed he kept a plastic container full of soil soaked with the blood of Cole. Rollins said "I dug up all the earth where his head fell—he was shot in the face—and Ive got all the dirt here, and so Coles in the house. I say good morning to him every day. I got his phone, too, so I got a direct line to him. So that feels good."<ref name=LAT/>

In a 2001 interview with Howard Stern, Rollins was asked about rumors that he had Coles brain in his house. Rollins stated that he only has the soil from the spot Cole was killed. During the interview, Rollins also speculated that the reason they were targeted may have been because, days prior to the incident, record producer Rick Rubin – a fan of Rollins Band – had requested to hear the then newly recorded album The End of Silence and parked his Rolls-Royce outside their Venice Beach house while carrying a cell phone. Because of the notoriety of the neighborhood, Rollins suspected that this would bring trouble because of the implication that there was money in the home. He even wrote in his journal the night of Rubins visit: "My place is going to get popped."<ref>[https://youtube.com/nmceYEk7ou8?t=36m49s ]{{dead link date=March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-Kr3JbpXXc  title=YouTube  publisher=YouTube  date=  accessdate=2017-03-04}}</ref>

On December 3, 2009, Rollins wrote of his support for the victims of the Bhopal disaster in India, in an article for Vanity Fair (magazine) Vanity Fair<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2009/12/twenty-five-years-after-the-disaster-bhopal-is-still-ill.html  title=Twenty-five Years After the Disaster, Bhopal Is Still Ill  publisher=Vanity Fair  date=2009-12-03}}</ref> 25 years–to the day–after the methyl isocyanate gas leak from the Union Carbide Corporations pesticide factory exposed more than half a million local people to poisonous gas and resulted in the death of 17,000.
