Falcone often makes cameo appearances in movies and television shows starring McCarthy, such as a third-season episode of Gilmore Girls, Bridesmaids, The Heat, Tammy, Identity Thief, Spy, and The Boss.

Since the start of the Mike & Molly series, McCarthy has lost an estimated {{convert 75 lbs round=5 abbr=on}}.
