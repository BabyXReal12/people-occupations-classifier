Brother Theodore (born Theodore Gottlieb; November 11, 1906 – April 5, 2001) was a Germany German-born United States American monologue monologuist and comedian known for rambling, stream-of-consciousness dialogues which he called "stand-up tragedy".  He was a man described as "Boris Karloff, surrealist Salvador Dalí, Nijinsky and Red Skelton…simultaneously".

==Biography==

===Early years===
Gottlieb was born into a wealthy Jewish family in Düsseldorf, in the Rhine Province, where his father was a magazine publisher. He attended the University of Cologne. At age 32, under Nazism Nazi rule, he was imprisoned at the Dachau concentration camp until he signed over his familys fortune for one German reichsmark Reichsmark. After being deported for chess hustling from Switzerland, he went to Austria where Albert Einstein, a family friend and alleged lover of his mother, helped him escape to the United States.<ref name="nytobit">{{cite news  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/06/arts/theodore-gottlieb-dark-comedian-dies-at-94.html  title=Theodore Gottlieb, Dark Comedian, Dies at 94  first=Douglas  last=Martin  newspaper=The New York Times  date=April 6, 2001}}</ref><ref name="MILESTONES">{{cite magazine  url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,999698,00.html  title= Milestones  magazine=Time (magazine) Time  date=April 16, 2001  last1=Adams  first1=Kathleen  last2=August  first2=Melissa  last3=Hartwell  first3=Randy  last4=Martens  first4=Ellin  last5=Pierro  first5=Joseph  last6=Song  first6=Sora  issn=0040-781X}}</ref>

===Success===
Theodores career as a monologuist began in California in the late 1940s, with dramatic Edgar Allan Poe Poe recitals. He moved to New York City, and by the 1950s, his monologues, now darkly humorous, had attracted a cult following. In 1958, he presented a one-man show that promoted the idea that human beings should walk on all fours. Jay Landesman booked him at St. Louis Crystal Palace during the 1960s. In the early 1960s, he frequently performed at the Café Bizarre in New Yorks Greenwich Village (106 W 3rd Street). He reached a wider audience through television, with 36 appearances on The Merv Griffin Show in the 1960s and 70s, and was also a guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, The Dick Cavett Show, and Joey Bishop The Joey Bishop Show. After his nightclub and TV appearances in the 1950s and 60s waned,<ref name="MILESTONES" /> he retired in the mid-1970s.

===Comeback===
He was pulled out of retirement and booked by magician Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brooks (entertainer) Dick Brooks in the Magic Towne House on the affluent Upper East Side of Manhattan for special weekend midnight performances. Years earlier, Brooks had remembered seeing Brother Theodore drawing packed crowds at small, funky and eclectic clubs all across the Lower East Side (Greenwich Village Greenwich and the East Village, Manhattan East Village) and sought him out for his new club. This resulted in a resurgence of interest in Brother Theodore that brought him success in his later years starting with Tom Snyders Tomorrow (TV series) Tomorrow Show in 1977 followed by more TV appearances and movies. According to Brooks, it took multiple calls to Theodore to convince him to make a comeback.  Theodores attitude was very bleak, and he felt his career was over.  Brooks wanted to charge ten or more dollars, but Theodore insisted on four dollars, so as not to scare people away.  The show was a success and ran for three years. A picture of the Magic Towne House ad appeared in local New York newspapers such as the Village Voice and The New York Post.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://dickbrookz.com/dickbrookzbiography.html  website=Dick Brookz website  title=Dick Brookz biography  year=1974-2018}}</ref>  

In an interview for MUM, The Society of American Magicians official magazine Dorothy Dietrich said <ref>{{cite web  url=http://houdini.org/dorothydietrichbiographymummagazinetext.html  website=Houdini Museum  title=Dorothy Dietrich - A Great Escape by Bruce Kalver  year=2016}}</ref> "Dick knew him. As a kid Dick used to see him around the village and they would be lined up around the block to see him. The stage was black with a pin spot on a desk which was raked towards the audience. The light comes on and there he is with a big shadow behind him. He just stares at the audience for an excruciatingly long time. Then he says, "Einstein is dead. Schopenhauer is dead... and Im not feeling so well myself!" He was the king of dark humor. He performed as a wacko. Truthfully, he was always depressed in real life and people thought it was his stage character.  He was from a rich family in Europe and then his whole family went to concentration camps and lost it all. When he came to the States, he quickly became a huge celebrity in the Village. Then he totally disappeared and became a has been. Dick remembered him and tracked him down. We asked him to perform at the Townhouse and he turned us down saying that his life was over and he couldnt perform anymore. We insisted that he try to perform again in our place. He didnt make it easy for us. He had all these provisions that he tried to use on us to not perform. He ended up doing the Saturday night midnight show for three years. We revived his career and it helped promote us.""We did Equity Showcase Theater for out of work actors to display their talents. We had famous directors trying out their shows. One time an audition for a two person show brought in 2000 actors vying for the parts. The line went all around the block."

Theodore made 16 appearances on NBCs Late Night with David Letterman in the 1980s. In the early 1980s, he was a regular on the Billy Crystal Billy Crystal Comedy Hour. He also did voice work, including the voice-over to the American trailer for Lucio Fulcis The House by the Cemetery in 1981. In 1989 he appeared in the Joe Dante comedy film The Burbs. Up until the late 1990s, he was a guest actor in several episodes of Joe Frank Joe Frank: Work in Progress radio show on National Public Radio (NPR).

An article on Theodore appeared in RAVE magazine with color photos. Segments from it are in the book Whos Who in Comedy. Just prior to his death from pneumonia, he recorded several monologues for the controversial documentary series, Disinformation (TV series) Disinfo Nation. He appeared in Billy Crystals mockumentary Dont Get Me Started and voiced the character of an ointment expert on NPRs Weekend Edition Saturday version of Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer in 1995.

===Documentary===
In early 2001, from the encouragement of his long-time friend & confidant, Jack Finelli, Theodore requested to meet with film artist Jeff Sumerel to consider the possibility of him producing a documentary about Theodore. After an in-person meeting, Sumerel received Theodores approval, and they agreed to proceed with the film.

Theodore was cautious, because of past documentary attempts that were aborted because of his eventual suspicions and distrust of the filmmaker(s). Sumerel was too, hearing of Theodores tendencies to self-sabotage past efforts. In February, preliminary shooting began, with informal interviews with Theodore in his apartment; however, in April, Theodore became ill with pneumonia and died.

Nevertheless, Sumerel was encouraged by Theodores family and friends to continue with the documentary.  Since no funding was available, Sumerel continued the project as a "labor of love", when time and financing allowed.  It was his interview with Henry Gibson that began to lead to other notable performers who were Theodore devotees.  Gibson connected Sumerel with Penn & Teller (friends of Gibsons) who were long-time, avid Theodorians.  Over the next 5 years Sumerel was able to capture interviews with Dick Cavett, Eric Bogosian, Tom Schiller, Len Belzer, Joe Dante, Mark Shulman (author) Mark Shulman, and Woody Allen, among others.  All of them gave no hesitation to participate, because of their admiration of and respect for Theodore. Sumerel spent the next 2 years gathering archival materials and working with editor, Jeter Rhodes, to sift through the vast amount of content conveying Theodores personal and professional life. In the end, Sumerel & Rhodes wove both stories into a non-traditional documentary fitting for Theodore and titled To My Great Chagrin: The Unbelievable Story of Brother Theodore.<ref>{{cite AV media  date=2008  title=To My Great Chagrin  medium=DVD  url=http://www.spontaneous.net/To_My_Great_Chagrin.html  access-date=June 20, 2017}}</ref> The film was selected for premiere, February 13, 2008 at the opening night of The Museum of Modern Arts Fortnight Series.
