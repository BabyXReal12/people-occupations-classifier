===Health===
In the summer of 2000, ODonnell suffered a staph infection after she accidentally cut the middle finger of her left hand with a knife while cutting a price tag off a fishing pole.<ref name="burned up"/> The infection incapacitated her for weeks, and nearly resulted in doctors amputating her hand.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2001/04/27/this-almostkilled-me-rosie-she-planned-funeral-during-infection-agony/ This Almost Killed Me: Rosie], Michael Starr, New York Post, April 27, 2001</ref> She later quipped that George W. Bush was to blame for the infection, saying that she was preparing to go on a fishing trip at the time in order to avoid seeing Bush on television during the then-ongoing 2000 Republican National Convention.<ref name="burned up"/>
ODonnell has acknowledged her struggles with recurrent, major depressive episodes during the fall and winter months consistent with seasonal affective disorder.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/07/AR2007030700984.html title=Rosie Says Shes Treated for Depression accessdate=July 2, 2017}}</ref>
