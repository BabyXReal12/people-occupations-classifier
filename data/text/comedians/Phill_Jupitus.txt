==Career==

Jupitus worked at the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) for five years, while he also wrote political poetry and drew cartoons. He resigned from the DHSS in 1984, hoping for a career in the music industry.

Using the moniker Porky the Poet, Jupitus became associated with Anti-Fascist Action and the ranting poetry scene, alongside Kool Knotes, Steven Wells Seething Wells, Swift Nick and Attila the Stockbroker. Jupitus approached local bands to offer himself as a support act for their tours: "I thought it looked easy, I was very cheap. If you got another band to support you, there are probably four of them and roadies and managers. But me—I just turned up and read poems."<ref name=standupcom1>{{cite web  url=http://www.wilco.dircon.co.uk/jupitus.htm  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316212255/http://www.wilco.dircon.co.uk/jupitus.htm  archivedate=16 March 2005  title=Giving it Large  first=Chris  last=Wilson}}</ref> His first vinyl recordings were part of the live Newtown Neurotics album Kickstarting a Backfiring Nation as Porky the Poet in 1987.

Jupitus toured colleges, universities and student unions, supporting bands such as Billy Bragg, the Style Council and The Housemartins. He supported Billy Bragg once more on the Labour Party (UK) Labour Party-sponsored Red Wedge tour in 1985: "In the early 80s, I got involved with Red Wedge, in which Neil Kinnock got various bands to stage concerts for Labour. The reason I got involved was 20% because I believed in the cause, 30% because I loved Billy Bragg, and 50% because I wanted to meet Paul Weller (singer) Paul Weller".<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,,404976,00.html  title=Home entertainment: Phill Jupitus &#124; The Guardian  publisher=Guardian.co.uk  date=  accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>

After Red Wedge, he found it difficult to get other bookings, due to the decline of political poetry as a mainstream art. He got a job as a runner for the independent record label Go! Discs, which had signed Billy Bragg and other bands, such as the Housemartins. Bragg said: "We ended up managing to get him a job at Go! Discs, which was brilliant. I was concerned that the cut-throat nature of the record business would make him jaded—underneath that rhino exterior there is quite a sensitive person—but that was before I realised that he was going to come back and do gigs again. Working at Go! Discs got his confidence up."

His performances of two of his poems, "Beano" and "Nobby", were included in the 1986 album Not Just Mandela, alongside tracks by Billy Bragg and Attila the Stockbroker, amongst others.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Not-Just-Mandela/release/1742913  title=Various - Not Just Mandela (Vinyl, LP) at Discogs  publisher=Discogs.com  date=  accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref> Released on Davy Lamp Records, all proceeds of the record were going to the Anti-Apartheid Movement.

Jupitus became press officer and Master of Ceremonies compere for The Housemartins (appearing in the 1986 music video for "London 0 Hull 4 Happy Hour"), using the role to continue being in front of an audience, while also filling support slots for other artists. During this time, he worked as a warm-up act on the Channel 4 TV show The Show. He quit working for Go! Discs in 1989 and fell back on his poetry and competing to try and gain a foothold on the London comedy circuit.

He conceived and directed the Brit Awards-nominated music video for Braggs "Sexuality (Billy Bragg song) Sexuality" in 1991 and wrote a parody version of that song about bestiality. He also appeared alongside R.E.M. in the music video for Braggs "You Woke Up My Neighbourhood" and performed in Searchlight (magazine) Searchlight magazines 2006 "Hope Not Hate" campaign tour with Bragg.{{Citation needed date=July 2008}} He has also appeared numerous times at the Glastonbury Festival as a DJ and a master of ceremonies compere in The Left Field tent.
