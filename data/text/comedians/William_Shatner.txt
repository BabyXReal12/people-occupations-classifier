His film debut was in the Canadian film Butlers Night Off (1951). His first feature role came in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer MGM film The Brothers Karamazov (1958 film) The Brothers Karamazov (1958) with Yul Brynner, in which he starred as the youngest of the Karamazov brothers, Alexei. In December 1958, he appeared opposite Ralph Bellamy, playing Roman tax collectors in Bethlehem on the day of Jesus birth in a vignette of a Hallmark Hall of Fame live television production entitled The Christmas Tree directed by Kirk Browning, which featured in other vignettes such performers as Jessica Tandy, Margaret Hamilton (actress) Margaret Hamilton, Bernadette Peters, Richard Thomas (actor) Richard Thomas, Cyril Ritchard, and Carol Channing. Shatner had a leading role in an Alfred Hitchcock Presents third-season (1957–58) episode titled "The Glass Eye," one of his first appearances on American television.

In 1959, he received good reviews when he played the role of Lomax in the Broadway production of The World of Suzie Wong. In March 1959, while performing on stage in Suzie Wong, Shatner was also playing detective Archie Goodwin (character) Archie Goodwin in what would have been televisions first Nero Wolfe#Nero Wolfe (CBS) Nero Wolfe series, had it not been aborted by CBS after shooting a pilot and a few episodes.<ref>{{cite news  author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  title=Two Stage Actors Signed by C.B.S.-TV: Kasznar and Shatner to Play in Nero Wolfe Pilot Film — Telephone Hour Plans  url=http://louderthannecessary.blogspot.com/2011_12_01_archive.html  newspaper=The New York Times  date=March 14, 1959  accessdate=2013-11-12  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112123234/http://louderthannecessary.blogspot.com/2011_12_01_archive.html  archivedate=November 12, 2013  df=mdy-all }}</ref> He appeared twice as Wayne Gorham in NBCs Outlaws (1960 TV series) Outlaws (1960) Western series with Barton MacLane, and then in another Alfred Hitchcock Presents 5th-season episode titled "Mother, May I Go Out to Swim?"

Shatner featured in two episodes of the NBC television series Thriller (U.S. TV series) Thriller ("The Grim Reaper" and "The Hungry Glass") and the film The Explosive Generation (1961).

Guthrie had called the young Shatner the Stratford Festivals most promising actor, and he was seen as a peer to contemporaries like Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, and Robert Redford. Shatner was not as successful as the others, however, and during the 1960s he "became a working actor who showed up on time, knew his lines, worked cheap and always answered his phone." His motto was "Work equals work," but Shatners willingness to take any role, no matter how "forgettable," likely hurt his career.{{r jordan20100903}} He took the lead role in Roger Cormans movie The Intruder (1962 film) The Intruder (1962) and received very good reviews for his significant role in the Stanley Kramer film Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) and two episodes, "Nick of Time (The Twilight Zone) Nick of Time" and "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet," of the science fiction anthology series The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series) The Twilight Zone. In the 1963–64 season, he appeared in an episode of the American Broadcasting Company ABC series Channing (TV series) Channing.  In 1963, he starred in the Family Theater production called "The Soldier" and received credits in other programs of The Psalms series. That same year, he guest-starred in Route 66 (TV series) Route 66, in the episode "Build Your Houses with Their Backs to the Sea."

In 1964, Shatner guest-starred in Season 2, Episode 2 (titled "Cold Hands, Warm Heart") of the ABC sci-fi anthology series The Outer Limits (1963 TV series) The Outer Limits. That appearance may have been considered prescient in relation to his iconic, career-defining role of Captain James T. Kirk on National Broadcasting Company NBCs series Star Trek (1966 TV series) Star Trek two years later. He played an astronaut returning from a mission who was discussing a planned mission to Mars called "Project Vulcan"; on Star Trek, Kirks first officer and best friend, Mr. Spock, was half-Vulcan and was born and raised on that planet. Also that year, he appeared in an episode of the CBS drama The Reporter (TV series) The Reporter ("He Stuck in His Thumb") and co-starred with Laurence Harvey, Claire Bloom, Newman, and Edward G. Robinson in the Western feature film The Outrage.

In 1965, Shatner guest-starred in Twelve OClock High (TV series) 12 OClock High as Major Curt Brown in the segment "I Am the Enemy" and in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. in an episode that also featured Leonard Nimoy, with whom Shatner would soon be paired in Star Trek. He also starred in the critically acclaimed drama For the People in 1965, as an District attorney assistant district attorney, co-starring with Jessica Walter. The program lasted only 13 episodes. Shatner starred in the 1966 Gothic fiction gothic horror film Incubus (1966 film) Incubus (Esperanto: Inkubo,) the second feature-length movie ever made with all dialogue spoken in Esperanto. He also starred in an episode of Gunsmoke in 1966 as the character Fred Bateman. He appeared as attorney-turned-counterfeiter Brett Skyler in a 1966 episode of The Big Valley, "Time To Kill." In 1967, he starred in the little known film White Comanche starring as two characters: Johnny Moon and his twin brother Notah.

{{Main article Star Trek: The Original Series}}
Shatner was cast as Captain James T. Kirk for the second pilot of Star Trek, titled "Where No Man Has Gone Before". He was then contracted to play Kirk for the Star Trek series and held the role from 1966 to 1969. During its original run on NBC, the series pulled in only modest ratings and was cancelled after three seasons. In his role as Kirk, Shatner famously kissed actress Nichelle Nichols (Lt. Uhura) in the November 22, 1968, Star Trek episode, "Platos Stepchildren". The episode is popularly cited as the first example of a kiss between a white man and a black woman on scripted television in the United States.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/shattered-tv-taboos-1005496.aspx  title=Shattered TV Taboos: How Bea Arthur and Others Broke Barriers  last=Molloy  first=Tim  date=April 27, 2009  website=TVGuide.com  publisher=CBS Interactive  location=San Francisco, CA  accessdate=2011-08-31  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616062610/http://www.tvguide.com/news/shattered-tv-taboos-1005496.aspx  archivedate=June 16, 2011  df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.space.com/entertainment/060907_star_trek.html  title=After 40 Years, Star Trek Wont Die  last=Malik  first=Tariq  date=September 7, 2006  work=Space.com  publisher=TechMediaNetwork  accessdate=2011-08-31  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008123202/http://www.space.com/entertainment/060907_star_trek.html  archivedate=October 8, 2009  df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.trektoday.com/news/050901_05.shtml  title=Nichols Talks First Inter-Racial Kiss  last=Sparborth  first=Christian Höhne  website=TrekToday  publisher=Christian Höhne Sparborth  location=Utrecht, Netherlands  date=September 5, 2001  accessdate=2011-08-31  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229160018/http://www.trektoday.com/news/050901_05.shtml  archivedate=February 29, 2012  df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1973, he returned to the role of Captain Kirk, albeit only in voice, in the Star Trek: The Animated Series animated Star Trek series.

===1970s===
After the cancellation of Star Trek in early 1969, Shatner experienced difficulty in finding work in the early 1970s, having become somewhat typecast from his role as Kirk. With very little money and few acting prospects, Shatner lost his home and lived in a truck bed camper in the San Fernando Valley until small roles turned into higher-paying jobs. Shatner refers to this part of his life as "that period", a humbling time during which he would take any odd job, including small party appearances, to support his family.

Shatner again appeared in ":wikt:schlock schlock" films, such as Cormans Big Bad Mama (1974) and the horror film The Devils Rain (1975),{{r jordan20100903}} Kingdom of the Spiders (1977), and the TV movie The Horror at 37,000 Feet. Shatner received good reviews as the lead prosecutor in a 1971 PBS (TV network) PBS adaptation of Saul Levitts play The Andersonville Trial. Other television appearances included a starring role in the western-themed secret agent series Barbary Coast (TV series) Barbary Coast during 1975 and 1976, and guest roles on many 1970s series such as The Six Million Dollar Man, Columbo, The Rookies, Kung Fu (TV series) Kung Fu, Ironside (TV series) Ironside and Mission: Impossible. A martial arts enthusiast, Shatner studied American Kenpo karate under black belt Tom Bleecker (who trained under the founder of American Kenpo Ed Parker).{{citation needed date=October 2014}} Shatner was an occasional celebrity guest on Pyramid (game show) The $10,000 Pyramid and The $20,000 Pyramid in the 1970s, once appearing opposite Leonard Nimoy in a week-long match-up billed as "Kirk vs. Spock". In a notable 1977 appearance he gave an illegal clue ("the blessed" for Things That Are Blessed; he intended to say "the Virgin Mary") at the top of the pyramid ($200) which deprived the contestant of a big money win, and reacted strongly, throwing his chair out of the Winners Circle.<ref>{{YouTube id=-UyxR9g7xi4&NR title="William Shatner blows $20K for a contestant" link=no}}</ref> Other shows included The Hollywood Squares, Celebrity Bowling,{{r jordan20100903}} Beat the Clock, Tattletales, Mike Stokeys Pantomime Quiz#Revivals Stump the Stars and Match Game.

After its cancellation, Star Trek engendered a cult following during the 1970s from syndicated reruns, and Captain Kirk became a cultural icon.{{r jordan20100903}} Shatner began appearing at Science fiction convention Star Trek conventions organized by Star Trek fandom Trekkies.<ref name="hern19750411">{{cite news  last=Hern  first=Lee  date=April 11, 1975  title={{-}}Star Trek fans still enthusiastic  url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Dh5UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=04wDAAAAIBAJ&dq=shatner%20trek%20convention&pg=6027%2C5877570  newspaper=Boca Raton News  agency=King Features Syndicate  accessdate=2011-03-22}}</ref> In the mid-1970s, Paramount Pictures Paramount began pre-production for a revised Star Trek television series, tentatively titled Star Trek: Phase II. However, the phenomenal success of Star Wars (film) Star Wars (1977) led the studio to instead consider developing a Star Trek motion picture. Shatner and the other original Star Trek cast members returned to their roles when Paramount produced Star Trek: The Motion Picture, released in 1979. He played Kirk in the next six Star Trek films, ending with the characters death in Star Trek Generations (1994).

His third marriage was to Nerine Kidd Shatner, from 1997 until her death in 1999. On August 9, 1999, Shatner returned home around 10&nbsp;p.m. to discover Nerines body at the bottom of their backyard swimming pool. She was 40 years old. An autopsy detected alcohol and Diazepam Valium (diazepam) in her blood, but the coroner ruled the cause of death as an accidental drowning. The Los Angeles Police Department LAPD ruled out foul play, and the case was closed.

Speaking to the press shortly after his wifes death, a clearly shaken and emotional Shatner said that she "meant everything" to him, and called her his "beautiful soulmate".<ref name="quirk">{{cite journal  author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  title=William Shatner: Captain Quirk  url=http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=149333  journal=The Bulletin  publisher=ninemsn Pty Ltd  date=October 3, 2006  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027171515/http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=149333  archivedate=October 27, 2006  accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref> Shatner urged the public to support Friendly House, a nonprofit organization that helps women re-establish themselves in the community after suffering from alcoholism and drug addiction.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue124/news.html title=Science Fiction News of the Week  work=Science Fiction Weekly  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325130127/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue124/news.html  archivedate=March 25, 2009  accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> He later told Larry King in an interview that "... my wife, whom I loved dearly, and who loved me, was suffering with a disease that we dont like to talk about: alcoholism. And she met a tragic ending because of it."<ref name="quirk" />

In his 2008 book Up Till Now: The Autobiography, Shatner discusses how Leonard Nimoy helped take Nerine to treatment for her alcoholism. Shatner writes in an excerpt from his book:
{{quote Leonard Nimoys personal experience of alcoholism now came to play a central role in my life and it helped us bond together in a way I never could have imagined in the early days of Star Trek. After Nerine [Kidd] and I had been to dinner with Leonard and Susan Nimoy one evening, Leonard called and said: "Bill, you know shes an alcoholic?" I said I did. I married Nerine in 1997, against the advice of many and my own good sense. But I thought she would give up alcohol for me. We had a celebration in Pasadena, and Leonard was my best man. I woke up about eight oclock the next morning and Nerine was drunk. She was in rehab for 30 days three different times. Twice she almost drank herself to death. Leonard took Nerine to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but she did not want to quit. }}

In 2000, a Reuters story reported that Shatner was planning to write and direct The Shiva (Judaism) Shiva Club, a dark comedy about the grieving process inspired by his wifes death.<ref>{{Cite news  title=Shatner takes inspiration from tragedy  work=The Seattle Times  date=July 4, 2000  agency=Reuters  page=E2}}</ref> Shatners 2004 album Has Been included a spoken-word piece titled "What Have You Done" that describes his anguish upon discovering his wifes body in the pool.

===Relationships with other actors===
Shatner first appeared on screen with Leonard Nimoy in 1964, when both actors guest-starred in an episode of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. entitled "The Project Strigas Affair." However, Shatner states in his autobiography that he does not recall meeting Nimoy at that time.{{fact date=July 2017}} As co-stars on Star Trek, they interacted socially both on and off the set. After Star Trek{{s}} cancellation in 1969, Shatner and Nimoy reunited in the production of Star Trek: The Animated Series, as well as The $20,000 Pyramid, where "Kirk vs. Spock" appeared on two different tables. Nimoy also guest-starred on T. J. Hooker, a show in which Shatner played the title role.

Shatners bereavement following the 1999 death of his third wife, Nerine, served to strengthen his friendship with Nimoy. Nimoy also appeared alongside Shatner at the TV Land Awards (hosted by John Ritter). Nimoy summarized his four-decade friendship with Shatner by remarking, "Bills energy was good for my performance, cause Spock could be the cool individual, our chemistry was successful, right from the start."

Nimoy spoke about their mutual rivalry during the Star Trek years:{{citation needed date=February 2018}}
{{quote   Very competitive, sibling rivalry up to here. After the show had been on the air a few weeks and they started getting so much mail for Spock, then the dictum came down from NBC: "Give us more of that guy, they love that guy, you know?" Well, that can be ... that can be a problem for the leading man who was hired as the star of the show; and suddenly, heres this guy with ears – "Whats this, you know?"   Leonard Nimoy}}

On an episode of the A&E (TV channel) A&E series Biography (TV series) Biography, where it was also divulged that Nimoy was Shatners best man at his wedding with his fourth wife Elisabeth, Nimoy remarked, "Bill Shatner hogging the stage? No. Not the Bill Shatner I know." When Nimoy died in 2015, Shatner stated "I loved him like a brother. We will all miss his humor, his talent, and his capacity to love." Although Shatner was unable to attend Nimoys funeral due to other commitments, his daughters attended in his place, and Shatner created his own online memorial for Nimoy.

Shatner has been a friend of actress Heather Locklear since 1982, when she began co-starring with him on T. J. Hooker. As she was also appearing in a semi-regular role in another Aaron Spelling production, Dynasty (1981 TV series) Dynasty, Locklear was asked by Entertainment Tonight whether this schedule was difficult. She replied "Id get really nervous and want to be prepared" for Shatner and for the experienced cast of Dynasty. After T.J. Hooker ended, Shatner helped Locklear get other roles. Locklear supported a grieving Shatner in 1999 when he was mourning the death of his wife Nerine. In 2005, Locklear appeared in two episodes of Shatners Boston Legal as Kelly Nolan, a woman being tried for killing her much older, wealthy husband. Shatners character is attracted to Nolan and tries to insert himself into her defense.{{Clarify date=November 2014}} Locklear was asked how she came to appear on Boston Legal. She explained "I love the show, its my favorite show; and I sorta kind of said, Shouldnt I be William Shatners illegitimate daughter, or his love interest?"

For years, Shatner was accused by some of his Star Trek co-stars of being difficult to work with, particularly by George Takei, Walter Koenig and James Doohan, the latter two of whom Shatner acknowledges in his autobiography Star Trek Movie Memories. In the 2004 Star Trek DVD sets, Shatner seemed to have made up with Takei, but their differences continue to resurface.<ref>{{cite news  last=Tucker  first=Reed  date=July 21, 2014  url=https://nypost.com/2014/07/21/40-years-later-william-shatner-and-george-takei-still-feuding/  title=40 years later, William Shatner and George Takei still feuding  work=New York Post  accessdate=2014-10-11  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008095448/http://nypost.com/2014/07/21/40-years-later-william-shatner-and-george-takei-still-feuding/  archivedate=October 8, 2014  df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In the 1990s, Shatner made numerous attempts to reconcile with Doohan, but was unsuccessful for some time, Doohan being the only former Star Trek co-star refusing to be interviewed by Shatner for his 1993 memoir Star Trek Memories and its 1994 follow-up, Star Trek Movie Memories. However, an Associated Press article published at the time of Doohans final convention appearance in late August 2004 stated that Doohan, already suffering from severe health problems, had forgiven Shatner and they had mended their relationship. At a convention directly preceding Doohans last one, Sky Conway, the conventions head, stated, "At our show: The Great Bird of the Galaxy in El Paso Texas in November 2003, a celebration of Gene Roddenberry and Star Trek, Bill and Jimmy went on stage together. Behind the scenes and before they went on stage, they hugged each other, apologized and expressed their love and admiration for each other. Bill specifically asked me to get them together so he could make amends and clear the air between the two of them before it was too late."<ref>{{cite news  last=Pascale  first=Anthony  date=December 9, 2010  url=http://trekmovie.com/2010/12/09/george-takei-william-shatner-refused-to-appear-on-stage-with-james-doohan-at-farewell-con/  title=George Takei: William Shatner Refused To Appear On-Stage With James Doohan At Farewell Con  work=TrekMovie.com  accessdate=2014-10-11  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006133257/http://trekmovie.com/2010/12/09/george-takei-william-shatner-refused-to-appear-on-stage-with-james-doohan-at-farewell-con/  archivedate=October 6, 2014  df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Health problems===
Shatner suffers from tinnitus, which he has speculated might be the result of a pyrotechnics pyrotechnical accident on set while shooting the Star Trek episode "Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series) Arena" – though he did not begin to suffer symptoms until the early 1990s, more than twenty years after the incident. Shatner is involved in the American Tinnitus Association. His treatment for this condition involved wearing a small electronic device that generated a low-level, broadband sound (white noise) that "helped his brain put the tinnitus in the background" – a process known as habituation.<ref>{{cite news last=Thomas  first=Nick  date=June 25, 2007  url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2003760030_tinnitus25.html  title=Easing the torment of tinnitus  work=The Seattle Times  accessdate=2009-09-13  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109031719/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2003760030_tinnitus25.html  archivedate=January 9, 2009  df= }}</ref>
