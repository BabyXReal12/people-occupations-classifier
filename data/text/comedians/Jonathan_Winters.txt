==Early career==

Winters career started as a result of a lost wristwatch, about six or seven months after his marriage to Eileen in 1948. The newlyweds couldnt afford to buy another one. Then Eileen read about a talent contest in which the first prize was a wristwatch, and encouraged Jonathan to "go down and win it." She was certain he could, and he did.
His performance led to a disc jockey job, where he was supposed to introduce songs and announce the temperature.
Gradually his ad libs, personae, and antics took over the show.
He began comedy routines and acting while studying at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. He was also a local radio personality on WING (mornings, 6 to 8) in Dayton, Ohio, and at WIZE in Springfield, Ohio. He performed as "Johnny Winters" on WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio, for two and a half years. Jerome R. "Ted" Reeves, then Program Director for WBNS-TV, arranged for his first audition with CBS in New York City.
After promising his wife that he would return to Dayton if he did not make it in a year, and with $56.46 in his pocket, he moved to New York City, staying with friends in Greenwich Village. After obtaining Martin Goodman as his agent, he began stand-up routines in various New York nightclubs. His earliest network television appearance was in 1954 on Chance of a Lifetime (1950s TV series) Chance of a Lifetime hosted by Dennis James on the DuMont Television Network, where Winters again appeared as "Johnny Winters."

Winters made History of television television history in 1956 when RCA broadcast the first public demonstration of color videotape on The Jonathan Winters Show. Author David Hajdu wrote in The New York Times (2006), "He soon used video technology to appear as two characters, bantering back and forth, seemingly in the studio at the same time. You could say he invented the video stunt."
His big break occurred (with the revised name of Jonathan) when he worked for Alistair Cooke on the CBS Television Sunday morning show Omnibus (US TV series) Omnibus.
In 1957 he performed in the first color television show, a 15-minute routine sponsored by Tums.

Winters recorded many classic comedy albums for the Verve Records label, starting in 1960. Probably the best known of his characters from this period is "Maude Frickert", the seemingly sweet old lady with the barbed tongue. He was a favorite of Jack Paar, who hosted The Tonight Show from 1957 to 1962, and appeared frequently on his television programs, even going so far as to impersonate then–U.S. president John F. Kennedy over the telephone as a prank on Paar.

However, Winters had a dramatic role in The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series) The Twilight Zone episode "A Game of Pool (1961) A Game of Pool" (episode 3.5 aired on October 13, 1961). He also recorded Ogden Nashs The Carnival of the Animals poems to Camille Saint-Saënss classical opus.

On The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962–92), Winters would usually perform in the guise of some character. Johnny Carson Carson often did not know what Winters had planned and usually had to tease out the characters backstory during a pretend interview. Carson invented a character called "Aunt Blabby," which was similar to and possibly inspired by "Maude Frickert."

Winters appeared in more than 50 movies and many television shows, including particularly notable roles in the film Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and in the dual roles of Henry Glenworthy and his dark, scheming brother, the Rev. Wilbur Glenworthy, in the The Loved One (film) film adaptation of Evelyn Waughs novel The Loved One.

Due to the different Orkan physiology, Mork &amp; Mindy Mork laid an egg, which grew and hatched into the much older Winters. It had been previously explained that Orkans aged "backwards," thus explaining Mearths appearance and that of his teacher, Miss Geezba (portrayed by then-11-year-old actress Louanne Sirota). Morks infant son Mearth in Mork &amp; Mindy was created in hopes of improving ratings and as an attempt to capitalize on Williamss comedic talents. Winters had previously guest-starred in Season 3, Episode 18, as Dave McConnell, Mindys uncle.

In his interview with the Archive of American Television, Winters reported that he spent eight months in a private psychiatric hospital in 1959 and again in 1961. The comic suffered from mental breakdown nervous breakdowns and bipolar disorder.
With an unprecedented frenetic energy, Winters made obscure references to his illness and hospitalization during his Stand-up comedy stand-up routines, most famously on his 1960 comedy album, The Wonderful World of Jonathan Winters. During his classic "flying saucer" routine, Winters casually mentions that if he wasnt careful, the authorities might put him back in the "zoo", referring to the institution.

"These voices are always screaming to get out," Winters told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. "They follow me around pretty much all day and night." Winters was able to use his talents in voice-over roles as a result. A devotee of Groucho Marx and Laurel and Hardy, Winters once claimed, "Ive done for the most part pretty much what I intended." He told U.S. News &amp; World Report U.S. News, "I ended up doing comedy, writing, and painting.... Ive had a ball, and as I get older I just become an older kid."

Many comedians, actors, and friends gave personal tributes about Winters on social media shortly after his death. Robin Williams posted, "First he was my idol, then he was my mentor and amazing friend. Ill miss him huge. He was my Comedy Buddha. Long live the Buddha."
In September 2013, at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards, Williams would again honor the career and life of Winters.
==Comedy style and legacy==
A pioneer of improvisational stand-up comedy with a gift for Mimesis mimicry, Impersonator impersonations, various personalities, and a seemingly bottomless reservoir of creative energy, Winters was one of the first celebrities to go public with a personal Mental disorder mental illness issue and felt stigmatized as a result.
According to Jack Paar, "If you were to ask me the funniest 25 people Ive ever known, Id say, Here they are—Jonathan Winters.{{Space double}} He also said of Winters, "Pound for pound, the funniest man alive."
With his round, rubber-faced mastery of Impressionist (entertainment) impressions (including ones of John Wayne, Cary Grant, Groucho Marx, James Cagney, and others) and improvisational comedy, Winters became a staple of Late night television in the United States late-night television with a career spanning more than six decades. With notable honors, many television show, film and Stand-up comedy comedy circuit appearances, Winters was known to start his stage shows by commanding an applauding audience that had risen to its feet to: "Please remain standing throughout the evening."
Winters performed a wide range of characters: hillbilly hillbillies, arrogant city slickers, nerve-shattered airline pilots trying to hide their fear, disgruntled Western (genre) westerners, judgmental Martians, little old ladies, nosy gas station attendants, a hungry cat eyeing a mouse, the oldest living airline stewardess, and more. "I was fighting for the fact that you could be funny without telling jokes," he told The New York Times, adding that he thought of himself foremost as a writer and less as a stand-up comedian. He named James Thurbers sophisticated absurdity as influential and said he idolized writers with a gift for humor.
Two of his most memorable characters, cranky granny "Maude Frickert" and Yokel bumpkin farmer "Elwood P. Suggins" ("I think eggs 24 hours a day"), were born from his early television routines. Robin Williams once told Playboy why Mr. Winters inspired him. "It was like seeing a guy behind a mask, and you could see that his characters were a great way for him to talk about painful stuff," he said. "I found out later that they are people he knows—his mother, his aunt. Hes an artist who also paints with words. He paints these people that he sees."

Onstage and off, Winters was wildly unpredictable. He was often viewed by Film producer producers as a liability, and this led to a scattershot, though memorable, film career. On television, his two self-titled variety shows displayed him in dazzling form as a sketch comedy sketch comic and impersonator.
Winters was an Artistic inspiration inspiration for performers such as Johnny Carson, Billy Crystal, Tracey Ullman, Lily Tomlin, Steve Martin, Jim Carrey, and Jimmy Kimmel. Robin Williams credited Winters as his comedy mentor, and the two co-starred on Mork &amp; Mindy.
In a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Winters likened the Show business entertainment industry to the Olympic Games Olympics, with actors standing on boxes to receive gold medal gold, silver medal silver, and bronze medals. Winters claimed, "I think my place is inside the box, underneath the guy receiving the gold medal. Theyre playing the national anthem and Im fondling a platinum medallion."
