Milton "Gummo" Marx (October 23, 1893 – April 21, 1977) was an American vaudevillian performer, actor, comedian and theatrical agent.<ref name=obit/> He was the second youngest of the five Marx Brothers. Born in Manhattan, New York City, he worked with his brothers on the vaudeville circuit, but left acting when he was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War I (years before his brothers, Chico Marx Chico, Harpo Marx Harpo, Groucho Marx Groucho, and Zeppo Marx Zeppo, began their film careers).

==Life and career==
Marx was born in Manhattan, New York City, on October 23, 1893.<ref>The 1900 United States Census shows his birth as "October 1892". His World War I draft registration uses "October 21, 1892". His death certificate and his grave use the year 1893. The documents closest to the birth date are usually more accurate.</ref> His parents were Sam Marx (called "Frenchie" throughout his life), and his wife, Minnie Marx Minnie Schoenberg Marx. Marxs family was Jewish. His mother was from Dornum in East Frisia, and his father was a native of Alsace and worked as a tailor.<ref>[http://judaisme.sdv.fr/perso/marxbr/geneal.htm La famille paternelle des Marx Brothers] {{fr icon}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news title=Mrs. Minnie Marx.

Although the fourth Marx Brother in age, he was the first to make his debut, pretending to be a dummy in an act with his uncle Henry Shean (né Heinemann Schoenberg) in 1899.  Milton was put into a costume with a papier-mâché head and pretended to be a dummy while Henry pretended to work him.  The act may have only performed once and was not helped by Sheans deafness or Miltons stammer.<ref>{{cite book last=Bader first=Robert S. title=Four of the Three Musketeers: The Marx Brothers on Stage  date=2016 publisher=Northwestern University Press location=Evanston, IL pages=53–54 isbn=9780810134164}}</ref>

Gummo, who in an interview said he never liked being on stage, left the group and joined the military during World War I. He was not sent overseas because the armistice was signed shortly afterward. Gummos younger brother Zeppo took his place in the group. Gummo later went into the raincoat business.<ref>{{citation  title=Current Biography  url=http://tc.education.pitt.edu/library/MS-ReSearch/I-Search2009/MarxBrothersCurrentBio.html  publisher=H. W.

He also represented other on-screen talent and a number of writers, and was well respected as a businessman. He rarely required contracts, believing that if the people he represented liked his work, they would stay with him; and if not, would seek representation elsewhere.<ref>Simon Louvish (2000) Monkey Business: The Lives and Legends of the Marx Brothers.

Around the time he left his brothers Vaudeville act, Marx applied for a patent for a clothes packing rack.  On October 28, 1919, Marx was granted patent US1320335A.<ref>[https://patents.google.com/patent/US1320335A/en?q=milton+marx Patent US1320335A: Devices facilitating the insertion of articles or materials into bags e.g. guides or chutes], US Patent Office, 1919.</ref>

Gummo may have received his nickname because he had a tendency to be sneaky backstage, creeping up on others like a "Detective gumshoe" (detective). Another explanation cited by biographers and family members is that Milton, the sickliest of the brothers, often wore Galoshes rubber overshoes, also called "gumshoes," to protect himself in inclement weather.<ref>{{cite book last=Bader first=Robert S. title=Four of the Three Musketeers: The Marx Brothers on Stage  date=2016 publisher=Northwestern University Press location=Evanston, IL page=170 isbn=9780810134164}}</ref>
