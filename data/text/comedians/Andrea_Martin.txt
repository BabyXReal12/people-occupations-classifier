==Career==
Soon after graduating from Emerson College, Martin won a role in a touring company of Youre a Good Man, Charlie Brown. After frequent visits to Toronto, she relocated from New York City to Toronto in 1970 and immediately found steady work in television, film, and theater.

In 1972, Martin played the character of Robin in a Toronto production of Godspell, with a company that included future stars Gilda Radner, Martin Short, Eugene Levy, Victor Garber, and musical director Paul Shaffer.<ref>[http://www.ovrtur.com/production/2898216/] http://www.ovrtur.com, accessed August 16, 2014</ref> Two of her early film appearances were in 1973s Cannibal Girls for which she won the Sitges Film Festival Award for Best Actress, and, in 1974, as the bookish Fraternities and sororities sorority sister Phyllis in Black Christmas (1974 film) Black Christmas, a Canadian slasher film.

Martin most notably portrayed leopard-print-wearing station manager Edith Prickley, whose dealings with the staff, including president/owner Guy Caballero, clueless newscaster Earl Camembert, and washed-up actor Johnny LaRue, helped to provide much of the shows humor. Other notable characters Martin played included incomprehensible European immigrant Pirini Scleroso, organ saleswoman Edna Boil, feminist TV show host Libby Wolfson, and childrens entertainer Mrs. Falbo.

Toklas, Patti Smith, Brenda Vaccaro and Indira Gandhi.<ref>[http://www.sctvguide.ca/characters/index.htm#martin "Andrea Martin Characters and Impersonations"] sctvguide.ca; accessed August 31, 2011</ref> In 1981, Martin was Emmy-nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Variety Show for her work in Second City Television SCTV.
