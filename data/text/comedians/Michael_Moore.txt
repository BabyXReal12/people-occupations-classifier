==Career==
Moore dropped out of the University of Michigan-Flint following his first year (where he wrote for the student newspaper The Michigan Times). At 22 he founded the alternative weekly magazine The Flint Voice, which soon changed its name to The Michigan Voice as it expanded to cover the entire state. Popstar Harry Chapin is credited with being the reason the magazine was able to start by performing benefit concerts and donating the money to Moore. Moore crept backstage after a concert to Harrys dressing room and convinced him to do a concert and give the money to him. Harry ended up doing a concert in Flint every year, selling out to the entire town.<ref>{{cite web  url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icVAfCMpets   title = Michael Moore on how Harry Chapin helped found the magazine}}</ref>  
In 1986, when Moore became the editor of Mother Jones (magazine) Mother Jones, a liberal political magazine, The Michigan Voice was shut down by the investors and he moved to California.{{Citation needed date=March 2017}}

After four months at Mother Jones, Moore was fired. Matt Labash of The Weekly Standard reported this was for refusing to print an article by Paul Berman that was critical of the Sandinista National Liberation Front Sandinista human rights record in Nicaragua.<ref name="Schultz">{{cite book last=Schultz first=Emily title=Michael Moore: a biorgraphy year=2005 publisher=ECW Press location=47–54 isbn=1-55022-699-1}}</ref> Moore refused to run the article, believing it to be inaccurate. "The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit. You would scarcely know from it that the United States had been at war with Nicaragua for the last five years."<ref>Cockburn, Alexander. "Beat The Devil: Michael meets Mr. Jones", The Nation, September 13, 1986.</ref>

Moore believes that Mother Jones fired him because of the publishers refusal to allow him to cover a story on the GM plant closings in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. He responded by putting laid-off GM worker Ben Hamper (who was also writing for the same magazine at the time) on the magazines cover, leading to his termination. Moore sued for wrongful dismissal, and settled out of court for $58,000, providing him with seed money for his first film, Roger & Me.<ref>Matt Labash.

; Canadian Bacon
: Moores 1995 satirical film features a fictional U.S. president (played by Alan Alda) engineering a fake war with Canada in order to boost his popularity. It is noted for containing a number of Canadian and American stereotypes, and for being Moores only non-documentary film. The film is also one of the last featuring Canadian-born actor John Candy, and also features a number of cameos by other Canadian actors. In the film, several potential enemies for Americas next great campaign are discussed by the president and his cabinet. (The scene was strongly influenced by the Stanley Kubrick film Dr. Strangelove.{{Citation needed date=March 2017}}) The president comments that declaring war on Canada was as ridiculous as declaring war on international terrorism. His military advisor (played by Rip Torn) quickly rejects this idea, saying that no one would care about "a bunch of guys driving around blowing up rent-a-cars."{{Citation needed date=March 2017}}

Moore drew attention in 2004 when he used the term "deserter" to describe then president George W. Bush while introducing Retired Army Gen. Wesley K.

I want to see that debate" between Clark and Bush – "the general versus the deserter". Moore said he was referring to published reports in several media outlets including The Boston Globe which had reported that "there is strong evidence that Bush performed no military service as required when he moved from Houston to Alabama to work on a U.S. Senate campaign from May to November 1972."<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mikes-letter/george-w-bush-awol#article2  title=George W.
