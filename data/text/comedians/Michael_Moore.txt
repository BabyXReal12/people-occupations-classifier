==Early life==
Michael Francis Moore was born in Flint, Michigan, and raised in Davison, Michigan Davison by parents Helen Veronica (née Wall),
a secretary, and Francis Richard "Frank" Moore, an automotive assembly-line worker.
At that time, the city of Flint was home to many General Motors factories, where his parents and grandfather worked. His uncle LaVerne was one of the founders of the United Automobile Workers trade union labor union and participated in the Flint Sit-Down Strike.
Moore was brought up Catholic,
and has Irish, Scottish, and English ancestry.
He attended parochial St. Johns Elementary School for primary school and later attended St. Pauls Seminary in Saginaw, Michigan, for a year.
He then attended Davison Community Schools#Davison High School Davison High School, where he was active in both drama and debate,
graduating in 1972. As a member of the Boy Scouts of America, he achieved the rank of Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America) Eagle Scout. At the age of 18, he was elected to the Davison school board.
At the time he was the youngest person elected to office in the U.S., as the minimum age to hold public office had just been lowered to 18.
==Career==
Moore dropped out of the University of Michigan-Flint following his first year (where he wrote for the student newspaper The Michigan Times). At 22 he founded the alternative weekly magazine The Flint Voice, which soon changed its name to The Michigan Voice as it expanded to cover the entire state. Popstar Harry Chapin is credited with being the reason the magazine was able to start by performing benefit concerts and donating the money to Moore. Moore crept backstage after a concert to Harrys dressing room and convinced him to do a concert and give the money to him. Harry ended up doing a concert in Flint every year, selling out to the entire town.
In 1986, when Moore became the editor of Mother Jones (magazine) Mother Jones, a liberal political magazine, The Michigan Voice was shut down by the investors and he moved to California.{{Citation needed date=March 2017}}

After four months at Mother Jones, Moore was fired. Matt Labash of The Weekly Standard reported this was for refusing to print an article by Paul Berman that was critical of the Sandinista National Liberation Front Sandinista human rights record in Nicaragua.
Moore refused to run the article, believing it to be inaccurate. "The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit. You would scarcely know from it that the United States had been at war with Nicaragua for the last five years."
Moore believes that Mother Jones fired him because of the publishers refusal to allow him to cover a story on the GM plant closings in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. He responded by putting laid-off GM worker Ben Hamper (who was also writing for the same magazine at the time) on the magazines cover, leading to his termination. Moore sued for wrongful dismissal, and settled out of court for $58,000, providing him with seed money for his first film, Roger &amp; Me.
===Directing/producing/screenwriting===
; Roger &amp; Me: The 1989 film was Moores first documentary about what happened to Flint, Michigan, after General Motors Corporation General Motors closed its factories and opened new ones in Mexico, where the workers were paid much less. Since then Moore has become known as a critic of the neoliberalism neoliberal view of globalization.{{Citation needed date=March 2017}} "Roger" is Roger Smith (executive) Roger B. Smith, former CEO and President of General Motors. Harlan Jacobson, editor of Film Comment magazine, said that Moore muddled the chronology in Roger &amp; Me to make it seem that events that took place before G.M.s layoffs were a consequence of them.{{Citation needed date=March 2017}} Critic Roger Ebert defended Moores handling of the timeline as an artistic and stylistic choice that had less to do with his credibility as a filmmaker and more to do with the flexibility of film as a medium to express a satiric viewpoint.
; Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint: Moore made a follow-up 23-minute documentary film that aired on PBS in 1992. It is based on Roger &amp; Me. The films title refers to Rhonda Britton, a Flint, Michigan, resident featured in both the 1989 and 1992 films who sells rabbits as either pets or meat.
; Canadian Bacon
: Moores 1995 satirical film features a fictional U.S. president (played by Alan Alda) engineering a fake war with Canada in order to boost his popularity. It is noted for containing a number of Canadian and American stereotypes, and for being Moores only non-documentary film. The film is also one of the last featuring Canadian-born actor John Candy, and also features a number of cameos by other Canadian actors. In the film, several potential enemies for Americas next great campaign are discussed by the president and his cabinet. (The scene was strongly influenced by the Stanley Kubrick film Dr. Strangelove.{{Citation needed date=March 2017}}) The president comments that declaring war on Canada was as ridiculous as declaring war on international terrorism. His military advisor (played by Rip Torn) quickly rejects this idea, saying that no one would care about "a bunch of guys driving around blowing up rent-a-cars."{{Citation needed date=March 2017}}
