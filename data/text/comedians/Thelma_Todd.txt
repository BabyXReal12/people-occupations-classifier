Appearing in about 120 pictures between 1926 and 1935, she is best remembered for her comedic roles in films such as Marx Brothers Monkey Business (1931 film) Monkey Business, Horse Feathers, and a number of Charley Chases short comedies and co-starring with Buster Keaton and Jimmy Durante in Speak Easily. She also had roles in Wheeler and Woolsey farces and several Laurel and Hardy films, the last of which (The Bohemian Girl (1936 film) The Bohemian Girl) featured her in a part that was truncated by her suspicious death at the age of 29.

During the silent film era, Todd appeared in numerous supporting roles that made full use of her beauty but gave her little chance to act. With the advent of the talkies, Todd was given opportunity to expand her roles when producer Hal Roach signed her to appear with such comedy stars as Harry Langdon, Charley Chase, and Laurel and Hardy.

In 1931, Roach cast Todd in her own series of slapstick comedy shorts, running 17 to 27 minutes each. In an attempt to create a female version of Laurel and Hardy,  Roach teamed Todd with ZaSu Pitts (pronounced "say-zoo," also her characters name) for 17 shorts, from "Lets do Things" (June 1931) through "One Track Minds" (May 1933). When Pitts left in 1933, she was replaced by Patsy Kelly, appearing with Todd in 21 shorts, from "Beauty and the Bus" (September 1933) through "An All American Toothache" (January 1936). These Roach shorts often cast Todd as a working girl having all sorts of problems and trying her best to remain poised and charming despite the embarrassing antics of her sidekick.

In 1931, Todd starred in Corsair (film) Corsair, a film directed by Roland West, with whom she would later become romantically involved. <ref name="Allmovie">{{cite web url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/p71178 first=Hal last=Erickson title=Thelma Todd work=Allmovie.com deadurl=no archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222125855/http://www.allmovie.com/artist/p71178 archivedate=2015-12-22 df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book title =Joyita: Solving the Mystery first=David last=Wright publisher=Auckland University Press year=2002 isbn=1-86940-270-7 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Td3_d9o81QMC&pg=PA3&dq=Jewel+Carmen page=3}}</ref>

Todd became highly regarded as a capable film comedian, and Roach loaned her out to other studios to play opposite Wheeler & Woolsey, Buster Keaton, Joe E. Brown (comedian) Joe E. Brown, and the Marx Brothers. She also appeared successfully in such dramas as the original 1931 film version of The Maltese Falcon (1931 film) The Maltese Falcon starring Ricardo Cortez as Sam Spade, in which she played Miles Archers treacherous widow. During her career she appeared in 119 films, although many of these were short films, and was sometimes publicized as "The Ice Cream Blonde."

In August, 1934, Todd opened a successful cafe, Thelma Todds Sidewalk Cafe, at 17575 Pacific Coast Highway in the Los Angeles coastal neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles Pacific Palisades. It attracted a diverse clientele of Hollywood celebrities as well as many tourists.<ref>{{cite book last=Wallace first=David  author2=Miller, Ann  title=Hollywoodland publisher=Macmillan year=2003 pages=21 isbn=0-312-31614-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://benny-drinnon.blogspot.com/2014/01/  title=Archived copy  accessdate=2017-12-08  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208175028/http://benny-drinnon.blogspot.com/2014/01/  archivedate=2017-12-08  df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://hollywoodhistoricphotos.com/product_info.php/products_id/5832  title=Archived copy  accessdate=2017-12-08  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208175136/http://hollywoodhistoricphotos.com/product_info.php/products_id/5832  archivedate=2017-12-08  df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://hollywoodhistoricphotos.com/product_info.php/products_id/5833  title=Archived copy  accessdate=2017-12-08  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208174939/http://hollywoodhistoricphotos.com/product_info.php/products_id/5833  archivedate=2017-12-08  df= }}</ref>

Todd continued her short-subject series through 1935 and was featured in the full-length Laurel and Hardy comedy The Bohemian Girl. This was her last film; she died after completing all of her scenes, but most of them were re-shot. Producer Roach deleted all of Todds dialogue and limited her appearance to one musical number.<ref>{{cite book last=Louvish first=Simon  title=Stan and Ollie, The Roots of Comedy: The Double Life of Laurel and Hardy publisher=Macmillan year=2002 pages=339 isbn=0-312-26651-0}}</ref>

===Death===

On the morning of December 16, 1935, Thelma Todd was found dead in her car inside the garage of Jewel Carmen, a former actress and former wife of Todds lover and business partner, Roland West. Carmens house was approximately a block from the topmost side of Todds restaurant.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=LQsB66qPGmgC&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=Roland</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.palipost.com/property-that-housed-thelma-todds-sidewalk-cafe-sold-for-6-million-exclusive-look-inside/  title=Archived copy  accessdate=2017-12-08  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209043950/https://www.palipost.com/property-that-housed-thelma-todds-sidewalk-cafe-sold-for-6-million-exclusive-look-inside/  archivedate=2017-12-09  df= }}</ref><ref>http://www.iamnotastalker.com/2008/10/27/thelma-todds-sidewalk-cafe/</ref> Her death was determined to have been caused by carbon monoxide poisoning. West is quoted in a contemporaneous newspaper account<ref name="Thelma Todd Feared Gangs">{{cite journal title=Thelma Todd Feared Gangs journal=The Milwaukee Journal date=Dec 18, 1935 url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gKBQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PSIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6744%2C3320913 accessdate=10 January 2016}}</ref> as having locked her out, which may have caused her to seek refuge and warmth in the car. Todd had a wide circle of friends and associates as well as a busy social life.

Police investigations revealed that she had spent the previous Saturday night (December 14) at the Trocadero (Los Angeles) Trocadero, a popular Hollywood restaurant, at a party hosted by entertainer Stanley Lupino and his actress daughter, Ida Lupino Ida. At the restaurant, she had had a brief but unpleasant exchange with her ex-husband, Pat DiCicco. However, her friends stated that she was in good spirits and were aware of nothing unusual in her life that could suggest a reason for her committing suicide.<ref>{{YouTube S-hBdyM4v3o Thelma Todd "Mysteries & Scandals"}}</ref> She was driven home from the party in the early hours of December 15 by her chauffeur, Ernest O.

The detectives of the Los Angeles Police Department LAPD concluded that Todds death was accidental, the result of her either warming up the car to drive it or using the heater to keep herself warm. A Coroners Inquest into Todds death was held on December 18, 1935.<ref>Donati, William. The Life and Death of Thelma Todd. McFarland & Company, Inc., 2012, p. 104.</ref> Autopsy surgeon A.P.

The Life and Death of Thelma Todd. McFarland & Company, Inc., 2012, p. 174</ref>

Subsequently a grand jury probe was held to determine whether Todds death was a murder. After four weeks of testimony, the inquiry was closed with no evidence of murder being brought forward.<ref name="Donati, William 2012, p. 187">Donati, William. The Life and Death of Thelma Todd. McFarland & Company, Inc., 2012, p. 187</ref> The case was closed by the Homicide Bureau, which listed the death as "accidental with possible suicide tendencies."  However, investigators were unable to find any motive for suicide or a suicide note.<ref name="Donati, William 2012, p. 187"/>

Visitation was held at Pierce Brothers Mortuary at 720 West Washington Blvd in Los Angeles

Todds body was cremated. After her mothers death in 1969, Todds remains were placed in her mothers casket and buried in Bellevue Cemetery in her hometown of Lawrence, Massachusetts.
