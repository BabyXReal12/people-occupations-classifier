Samuel Burl Kinison (December 8, 1953 &ndash; April 10, 1992) was an American stand-up comedian and actor. He was known for his intense, harsh and politically incorrect humor. A former Pentecostal preacher, he performed stand-up routines that were most often characterized by an intense style, similar to charismatic preachers, and punctuated by his trademark scream.

==Early life==
Samuel Burl Kinison was born in Yakima, Washington on December 8, 1953, the son of Marie Florence (née Morrow) and Samuel Earl Kinison, a Pentecostal preacher.<ref name="biography">{{cite web  url=http://www.biography.com/people/sam-kinison-424006  title=Sam Kinison, Comedian (1953–1992)  publisher=A+E Networks  accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref> The family moved to East Peoria, Illinois when Kinison was three months old.<ref name="pjs-called">{{cite news  url=http://www.pjstar.com/news/x1356915489/Luciano-Comedian-called-this-home  title=Comedian called this home  first=Phil  last=Luciano  work=Peoria Journal Star  date=April 10, 2012  page=B1  accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref> His father pastored several churches around the country, receiving little income. Kinison had two older brothers, Richard and Bill, and a younger brother, Kevin. His parents divorced when he was 11 and his brother Bill went to live with his father while Sam stayed with the rest of his family against his protestations. Bill described this as the root of much of Sams anger.<ref name="gq">{{cite journal  url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2012-04/20/sam-kinison-tribute-death-wild-thing-quotes-video/viewall  journal=GQ  date=April 20, 2012  title=Icon: Sam Kinison  last=Jones  first=Dylan  accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>

Sam later attended East Peoria Community High School in East Peoria.<ref name="biography"/> He and his brothers emulated their father by becoming Pentecostal preachers. Kinison attended Pinecrest Bible Training Center in Salisbury, Herkimer County, New York Salisbury Center, New York.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.megiloth.com/thoughts_and_opinions/social_commentary/samkinison.htm  title=Leader of the Banned  publisher=Megiloth.com  date=December 8, 1953  accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> His mother married another preacher and moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where Kinison lived for a while. He preached from the age of 17 to 24 and recordings of his sermons reveal that he used a "fire and brimstone" style, punctuated with shouts similar to the ones he would later use in his stand-up routines. His brother Bill, however, noted that "ironically, he had no stage presence" and he was not very successful at making money from preaching.<ref name="gq" /> After he and his first wife were divorced, he abandoned preaching and took up comedy as a profession.

==Career==
Kinison began his career in Houston, Texas, where he performed in small clubs. He became a member of a comedic group at the Comedy Workshop, known as the Texas Outlaw Comics, that also included Bill Hicks, Ron Shock, Riley Barber, Steve Epstein, Andy Huggins, John Farneti,<ref>{{cite web  url= http://recoverycomedy.com/promo-andy-huggins.html  title=Recovery Comedy is proud to present Andy Huggins  publisher=Recovery Comedy  date=  accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> and Jimmy Pineapple.<ref name="gq" /><ref>{{cite web url=http://recoverycomedy.com/promo-jimmy-pineapple.html  title=Recovery Comedy is proud to present Jimmy Pineapple  publisher=Recovery Comedy  date=  accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> Hicks cited Kinison as a major influence on his comedic style, noting that "He was the first guy I ever saw to go on stage and not in any way ask the audience to like him."<ref name="gq" /> In 1980, Kinison moved to Los Angeles hoping to find work at The Comedy Store, but was first employed as a doorman. He soon developed a cocaine habit, quickly progressing to the freebase form, and struggled to make a foothold in the business until his brother Bill moved to Los Angeles to help manage his career.<ref name="gq" />

His big break came on HBOs Rodney Dangerfields Ninth Annual Young Comedians Special in the summer of 1984.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6069058/  title=Kinison: The Scream Continues (2016)  publisher=IMDb  accessdate=November 12, 2016}}</ref> After noting the performance of Bob Nelson (comedian) Bob Nelson, reviewer Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote, "the most interesting of the other eight comedians is the savagely misogynistic Sam Kinison. Mr. Kinison specializes in a grotesque animalist howl that might be described as the primal scream of the married man."<ref>{{cite news  url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/02/arts/nine-comedians-appear-on-dangerfield-special.html  title=Nine Comedians Appear On Dangerfield Special  work=The New York Times  author-link=Stephen Holden  last=Holden  first=Stephen  date=August 2, 1985  accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref> Later, during Kinisons appearance on Late Night with David Letterman in 1985, David Letterman Lettermans introduction of Kinison warned his audience, "Brace yourselves. Im not kidding. Please welcome Sam Kinison."<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_VURr6jnWQ  title=Sam Kinison First Appearance on Letterman  publisher=YouTube  accessdate= May 19, 2014}}</ref>

Kinison played on his former role as a Bible-preaching evangelist, taking satirical and sacrilegious shots at the Bible, Christianity and famous Christian evangelist scandals of his day. Kinisons daring comedy helped shoot him to stardom.<ref name="biography" /> On several videos of his stand-up routines, a shot of his personalized license plate reveals the words "EX REV."

Kinison made his film debut in Rodney Dangerfields 1986 film Back to School, playing short-tempered Contemporary American History professor Dr. Terguson, who also happened to be a Vietnam veteran.

He was associated with the Los Angeles rock music scene and was occasionally accompanied by a touring band. He also gained a reputation as having a prodigious appetite for recreational drug use drugs and alcoholic beverage alcohol.<ref>Sam Kinison, Biography Channel, December 28, 2008.</ref>

In 1988, Kinison recorded a novelty version of The Troggs "Wild Thing (The Troggs song) Wild Thing", which appeared on his album Have You Seen Me Lately? The video was a hit on MTV. It featured a cameo by Rodney Dangerfield and Jon Bon Jovi, and starred many well-known rock musicians of the time, including Steven Tyler and Joe Perry (musician) Joe Perry of Aerosmith, Jonathan Cain and Deen Castronovo of Bad English, Richie Sambora and Alec John Such of Bon Jovi, Slash (musician) Slash and Steven Adler of Guns N Roses, Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe, C.C. DeVille of Poison (American band) Poison, Rudy Sarzo of Quiet Riot, Billy Idol, and Ratt, as well as a raunchy "roll on the mat" dance with Jessica Hahn. Also in 1988, Kinison appeared in the music video for the Bon Jovi single "Bad Medicine (song) Bad Medicine".

Kinison appeared in the episode "Its a Bundyful Life: Part 2" (1989) of Married... with Children, as Al Bundys guardian angel, who shows him what life would be like If he hadnt been born (a parody sendup of Its a Wonderful Life). He was also considered for the lead role of Al Bundy during preproduction of the show.

Also during 1989, he lent his voice to the song "The Kid Goes Wild" by the band Babylon A.D. (band) Babylon A.D.; the song was heard (briefly) in the movie RoboCop 2, but not the portion featuring Kinisons voice. Kinison also appeared in the Mötley Crüe music video for their hit single "Kickstart My Heart".

During one notable The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson Tonight Show performance, Kinison delivered what began as a straightforward version of Elvis Presleys "Are You Lonesome Tonight? (song) Are You Lonesome Tonight?", which descended into angry ranting during the spoken breakdown, and then segueing back into a straightforward sung ending.

Some of Kinisons most notable spontaneous moments came during his frequent appearances on The Howard Stern Show. He made an angry phone call on-air to Bobcat Goldthwait, and he embarrassed comedian Judy Tenuta to the point of driving her off the show. His most notorious stunt resulted in an on-air feud with Stern. Kinison made an on-air promise to bring to the show members of the band Bon Jovi, with whom Stern was feuding, but they did not appear, nor did Kinison. Sterns reaction was swift and vindictive, and Kinison eventually apologized, but not before comedian Gilbert Gottfried and Stern ridiculed an emotionally charged phone call between Stern and Kinison, in which both stars used the words "man" and "dude" so often that the playback was used as a bit on the show.

Stern and Kinison eventually reconciled and paired on Sterns pay-per-view special, U.S. Open Sores. Stern would later purchase the movie rights to Kinisons biography, written by Kinisons brother, at one point (2008) reporting that HBO would make Brother Sam with Kinison being played by Dan Fogler.<ref name=BioPic>{{cite news  url=https://variety.com/2008/scene/markets-festivals/brother-sam-set-for-hbo-1117996022/  title=Brother Sam set for HBO  first=Michael  last=Fleming  work=Variety (magazine) Variety  date=November 17, 2008  accessdate= January 22, 2018}}</ref>

In 1991, Kinison starred in the Fox Network television show Charlie Hoover, in which he played the inner voice of the title character, appearing as a {{convert 12 in cm adj=on}} tall man. The show lasted only seven episodes before being canceled.

In an interview with Sams brother and manager Bill Kinison, Bill mentioned movie deals that were in development at the time of his death; one such deal was a movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger, and another with Rick Moranis.<ref>Harris, Bill.

Kinisons legendary scream can be heard at the beginning of Anthrax (American band) Anthraxs 1987 song, "Im the Man (EP) Im the Man" and one of his comedy punch-lines ("Dick in your mouth all day!"), can be heard multiple times in Run–D.M.C.s 1988 single, "Beats to the Rhyme."

==Personal life==
Kinison acquired much of his material from his difficult first two marriages, to Patricia Adkins (1975–1980) and Terry Marze (1981–1989). He began a relationship with dancer Malika Souiri toward the end of his marriage with Marze. In 1990, Souiri alleged she was raped by a man Kinison had hired as a bodyguard that same day, while Kinison was asleep in the house.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20118169,00.html  title=Sam Kinisons Girlfriend Claims That While the Comic Slept Off a Hard Night, She Was Being Raped by His Bodyguard  journal=People (magazine) People  date=July 9, 1990  accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref> The bodyguard stated that the sex was consensual; the jury deadlocked in the subsequent trial and the charges were later dropped.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-26/local/me-3274_1_jury-deadlocks  work=Los Angeles Times  title=Jury Deadlocks in Kinison Bodyguards Rape Trial  date=October 26, 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1991/Charges-Dropped-Against-Kinison-s-Former-Bodyguard/id-e59fb1bd6ecdd5f940a7c1ca1a8ca18f  title=Charges Dropped Against Kinisons Former Bodyguard  publisher=Associated Press  date=February 8, 1991  accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>

On April 4, 1992, six days before his death, Kinison married Souiri at the Candlelight Chapel in Las Vegas Valley Las Vegas.<ref name="pjs-called"/> They honeymooned in Hawaii for five days before returning home to Los Angeles on April 10 to prepare for a show that night at the Riverside Resort Hotel & Casino Riverside Resort Hotel and Casino in Laughlin, Nevada.<ref name="lat-shocked" />

Souiri sued Kinisons brother Bill in 1995 for allegedly defaming her in his book Brother Sam: The Short Spectacular Life of Sam Kinison, and then again in 2009 for allegedly forging Sams will.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Kinison-Widow-Sues-Brother-in-Law-Over-Book-3038143.php  title=Kinison Widow Sues Brother-in-Law Over Book  newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle  date=April 7, 1995  accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.tmz.com/2009/06/23/sam-kinisons-widow-cries-fraud/  title=Sam Kinisons Widow Cries Fraud  date=June 23, 2009  publisher=TMZ  accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>

In February 2011, the Toronto Sun reported that Kinison had fathered a child with the wife of his best friend and opening act, Carl LaBove, who had been paying child support for the girl for nearly 13 years.<ref>{{cite web  work=Daily Mail  title=Sam Kinisons secret love child: DNA test allegedly prove a friends daughter was fathered by the late comic  date=February 18, 2011  url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1358387/Sam-Kinisons-secret-love-child-DNA-test-friends-daughter-fathered-late-comic.html}}</ref> LaBove filed legal papers claiming the girl was Kinisons, and Genetic testing DNA tests taken from Kinisons brother Bill show a 99.8% likelihood that Kinison was the father of the unnamed woman, who was 21 at the time of the Toronto Sun story, and excluded LaBove as her father.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/celebrities/2011/02/19/17337136-wenn-story.html  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224022207/http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/celebrities/2011/02/19/17337136-wenn-story.html  dead-url=yes  archive-date=February 24, 2011  title=Kinison fathered lovechild, pal says &#124; Celebrities &#124; Entertainment  newspaper=Toronto Sun  date=February 19, 2011  accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>

==Death==

Kinison was found lying between the seats of his car at the scene of the collision. He was not killed instantly, according to his brother.<ref name="biography"/>

His brother and the others begged him to lie down and he did with his best friend, Carl LaBove, who had been in the following van, holding his head in his hands. Initially, Kinison appeared to have suffered no serious injuries, but within minutes he suddenly said to no one in particular, "I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die." LaBove later said, "it was as if he was having a conversation, talking to someone else, some unseen person." Then there was a pause as if Kinison was listening to the other person speak. Then he asked "But why?" and after another pause LaBove heard him clearly say: "Okay, okay, okay.’ LaBove said, "The last ‘okay’ was so soft and at peace&nbsp;... Whatever voice was talking to him gave him the right answer and he just relaxed with it. He said it so sweet, like he was talking to someone he loved."<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.paulluvera.com/weblog/2009/11/the-strange-death-of-sam-kinison.html  title=THE STRANGE DEATH OF SAM KINISON  website=Paul Luvera Journal  access-date=2017-12-31}}</ref> Kinison then lost consciousness. Efforts to resuscitate him failed. Kinison died at the scene from internal injuries. An autopsy found that he had suffered numerous traumatic injuries, including a dislocated neck, a torn aorta, and torn blood vessels in his abdominal cavity, which caused his death within minutes of the collision.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/Celebs/kinison,%20sam_report.pdf  format=PDF  title=Sam Kinison Autopsy Report  access-date=August 26, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news  url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-29/news/mn-346_1_sam-kinison  title=Tranquilizers, Cocaine Found in Kinisons System  newspaper=Los Angeles Times  date=May 29, 1992  agency=Associated Press  access-date=August 26, 2013}}</ref> Malika Souiri, Kinisons wife, whom he had married six days earlier, was rendered unconscious by the collision, but survived the accident with a mild concussion.<ref>Carroll, Larry.

He was sentenced to one year of probation and 300 hours of community service, and his drivers license was suspended for two years.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR108281?refcatid=16  title=Kinison album, concert vid planned  newspaper=Variety  date=June 29, 1993  access-date=May 19, 2014}}</ref>

Kinison is interred with family members at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

==Legacy==
Comedian George Carlins eighth HBO stand-up comedy special, Jammin in New York, was dedicated to Kinisons memory. At the beginning of the broadcast, the words "this show is for SAM" appeared on the screen.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk-oAWH_W6c  title=George Carlin - Jammin In New York Part1  access-date=May 31, 2017}}</ref>

After his death, Kinison was fondly remembered by his friends and costars. Ozzy Osbourne said, "Apparently when Sam had the accident, I heard he got out of the car and look up to the heavens and said, I dont want to die, and then just said, Oh, okay, and laid down and died. It sounds crazy and will probably offend a lot of my fans, but I believe theres a higher power. Some people may think Sam Kinisons in one place, but I know where he is. Hes upstairs; hes next to God."<ref>{{cite web  url= http://www.digitaljournal.com/blog/1395#ixzz3T076UaMb  title=Sam Kinison  work= Digital Journal  first= Gloria   last= Scott  date= November 11, 2008  access-date= February 27, 2015}}</ref>
