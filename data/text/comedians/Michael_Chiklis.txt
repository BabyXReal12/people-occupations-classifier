After graduation, Chiklis moved to Brooklyn, New York City and was cast in the role of John Belushi in the controversial biopic Wired (film) Wired in 1989.<ref>{{cite news last=Stone first=Stone url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iGJWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=u_EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6651,5067182&dq=graduation+michael+chiklis+moved+to+new+york&hl=en title=Michael Chiklis: The show that could date=May 17, 1995 publisher=The Spokesman-Review accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref> The film was panned in general and flopped at the box office.<ref>{{cite news url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MN&p_theme=mn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EFE4816026B34E6&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM title=`Wired, film adaptation of Belushis life, has two good mimics, one bad plot date=August 28, 1989 publisher=Minneapolis Star-Tribune accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref> He also guest starred in several popular television series such as Miami Vice, B.L. Stryker, Wiseguy, L.A. Law, Murphy Brown, and Seinfeld alongside bit parts in films like Nixon (film) Nixon.

Chikliss first successful role was in The Commish, a police comedy/drama that ran from 1991–1996 on American Broadcasting Company ABC.  Chiklis played Anthony "Tony" J. Scali, a police commissioner in a small city in upstate New York.  After The Commish, Chiklis starred in the short-lived NBC sitcom Daddio.

After playing Curly Howard in the 2000 TV movie The Three Stooges (2000 film) The Three Stooges, Chiklis decided to reinvent his image. With his wifes help, he spent six months on an extensive workout regimen and shaved his head. He turned up to audition for The Shield looking nothing like the pudgy, friendly character of The Commish. Winning over creator Shawn Ryan, Chiklis nabbed the leading role of the shows anti-hero, LAPD Detective Vic Mackey. He won the 2002 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series for the role. Chiklis received a Golden Globe Award that same year for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series-Drama as well. Between 2004 and 2005, he was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama Series but did not win. Chiklis later parodied his role as Vic Mackey in "Monstourage," an episode of Robot Chicken. The skit involved Mackey accidentally switching places with Ben Grimm.

Since 2000, Chiklis has taken up a number of voice roles, voicing Chihiros father, Akio, in the English language English dub of Hayao Miyazakis Spirited Away and Roman/King Webster in the direct-to-video feature The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina. He has also performed in several episodes of Family Guy and had a voice role in Heavy Gear#TV series Heavy Gear: The Animated Series.

In 2005, he starred in Fantastic Four (2005 film) Fantastic Four as Thing (comics) Thing and reprised the role in its 2007 sequel, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Being a fan of the comic book series, he had dreamed of playing the character if ever there was a Fantastic Four movie being produced. Chiklis was often praised for his performance in a film that otherwise earned mixed reviews. His wife visited him on set during the filming but was not aware that he would be in his full bodysuit and makeup as The Thing; she was totally unprepared for seeing him like that and found it very distressing, having to be guided from the set in order to collect herself.{{citation needed date=May 2015}}

Chiklis had a role in the 2008 film Eagle Eye as the United States Secretary of Defense.

In the wake of Bernard Madoff scandal, Chiklis is developing a series at FX (TV channel) FX about a similar investment scheme. The project, called House of Cards, concerns a group committing an elaborate scam similar to the Madoff fraud. Chiklis had been developing the project since February 2008 after he and his wife became victims of a Ponzi scheme themselves. Cards will likely center on the leader of the scheme, with Chiklis planning to Executive Producer executive produce but not star.<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i213af1e960abb3d8de7eb6c944521172  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220212627/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i213af1e960abb3d8de7eb6c944521172  archivedate=December 20, 2008 title=Its in the Cards for Michael Chiklis first1=James last1=Hibberd work=The Hollywood Reporter }}</ref>

Following his stint on American Horror Story: Freakshow, Chiklis told Larry King that he did not enjoy working on the show: That was one of the darkest years of my career. It was, I think, it’s one thing to do a horror film in the context of like two months or something like that, but to live in that for six months it just became, I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I’m an empathetic person, and I just sometimes start to take things on. But it was so dark, and it was so nasty.<ref>http://www.ora.tv/larrykingnow/2016/10/19/why-michael-chiklis-wont-return-to-ahs</ref>
