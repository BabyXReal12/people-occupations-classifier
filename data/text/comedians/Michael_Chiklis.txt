He also guest starred in several popular television series such as Miami Vice, B.L. Stryker, Wiseguy, L.A. Law, Murphy Brown, and Seinfeld alongside bit parts in films like Nixon (film) Nixon.

Chikliss first successful role was in The Commish, a police comedy/drama that ran from 1991–1996 on American Broadcasting Company ABC.  Chiklis played Anthony "Tony" J. Scali, a police commissioner in a small city in upstate New York.  After The Commish, Chiklis starred in the short-lived NBC sitcom Daddio.

After playing Curly Howard in the 2000 TV movie The Three Stooges (2000 film) The Three Stooges, Chiklis decided to reinvent his image. With his wifes help, he spent six months on an extensive workout regimen and shaved his head. He turned up to audition for The Shield looking nothing like the pudgy, friendly character of The Commish. Winning over creator Shawn Ryan, Chiklis nabbed the leading role of the shows anti-hero, LAPD Detective Vic Mackey. He won the 2002 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series for the role.

Since 2000, Chiklis has taken up a number of voice roles, voicing Chihiros father, Akio, in the English language English dub of Hayao Miyazakis Spirited Away and Roman/King Webster in the direct-to-video feature The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina.

In 2005, he starred in Fantastic Four (2005 film) Fantastic Four as Thing (comics) Thing and reprised the role in its 2007 sequel, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Being a fan of the comic book series, he had dreamed of playing the character if ever there was a Fantastic Four movie being produced. Chiklis was often praised for his performance in a film that otherwise earned mixed reviews. His wife visited him on set during the filming but was not aware that he would be in his full bodysuit and makeup as The Thing; she was totally unprepared for seeing him like that and found it very distressing, having to be guided from the set in order to collect herself.{{citation needed date=May 2015}}

Chiklis had a role in the 2008 film Eagle Eye as the United States Secretary of Defense.

In the wake of Bernard Madoff scandal, Chiklis is developing a series at FX (TV channel) FX about a similar investment scheme.

Then in the series finale, his character drives his tractor-trailer truck head-first (unintentionally) into Jax Teller.

Autumn played Vic Mackeys daughter Cassidy on The Shield.
A lifelong comic book fan, he rarely turns down an autograph request from children.
In fact, according to the DVD commentary for the Fantastic Four film, his voice has been going hoarse from doing Thing (comics) The Things voice so many times; in Chiklis own words:
<blockquote>
 How do you say "no" to an 8-year-old?
</blockquote>

MCBs prior music was another single, Make Me High written for the independent film High School (2010 film) High School, starring Chiklis, Adrien Brody, Colin Hanks and Matt Bush (actor) Matt Bush, single released spring 2011.
Following his stint on American Horror Story: Freakshow, Chiklis told Larry King that he did not enjoy working on the show: That was one of the darkest years of my career. It was, I think, it’s one thing to do a horror film in the context of like two months or something like that, but to live in that for six months it just became, I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I’m an empathetic person, and I just sometimes start to take things on. But it was so dark, and it was so nasty.
===Philanthropy===
Chiklis has participated in celebrity Texas Hold Em tournaments to benefit comedian Brad Garretts charity foundation, Maximum Hope.
Michael has worked closely with many different charities over the years including The Childrens Lifesaving Foundation,
