Baldwin has called the attorneys in the case "opportunists", and has characterized Basingers psychologists as part of the "divorce industry". He has faulted them more than Basinger, and writes, "In fact, I blame my ex-wife least of all for what has transpired. She is a person, like many of us, doing the best she can with what she has. She is a litigant, and therefore, one who walks into a courtroom and is never offered anything other than what is served there.

Baldwin contended that after seven years of these issues, he hit a breaking point, and on April 11, 2007, left an angry voicemail message in response to another unanswered arranged call, in which Baldwin called his 11-year-old daughter a "rude, thoughtless little pig".<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 173–184.</ref> He contends that the tape was sold to TMZ.com TMZ which released the recording, despite laws against publishing media related to a minor without the permission of both parents.<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 178–179.</ref> Baldwin admitted that he made a mistake, but asked not to be judged as a parent based on a bad moment.<ref>Baldwin 2008. pp. 101, 151.</ref> He later admitted to Playboy in June 2009 that he contemplated suicide over the voicemail that leaked to the public.

In October 1995, Baldwin allegedly assaulted a photographer for videotaping his wife, Kim Basinger, and their 3-day-old daughter.

Whoopi Goldberg praised Baldwin for his actions during her opening monologue while hosting the 68th Academy Awards.<ref>{{cite news url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-27/local/me-61811_1_alec-baldwin title=Alec Baldwin Arrested in Battery on Photographer date=October 27, 1995  work=Los Angeles Times accessdate=March 27, 2014 first=Nicholas last=Riccardi}}</ref><ref>{{cite news url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/special/l96os054.htm title=Sassy Whoopi takes charge date=March 26, 1996  work=USA Today accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref>

===Runway incident===
In December 2011, Baldwin was on an American Airlines flight at Los Angeles International Airport, playing Words with Friends on his phone while waiting for takeoff. When instructed to put away the "electronic device" by the flight attendant, he reportedly became belligerent and was eventually removed from the plane. He later publicly apologized to the passengers who were delayed.<ref>[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/alec_baldwin_thrown_off_flight_at_ikgro0tlAWEveH4IMoa4YK "Alec Baldwin thrown off AA flight at LAX for playing game on phone"] {{webarchive  url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827001837/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/alec_baldwin_thrown_off_flight_at_ikgro0tlAWEveH4IMoa4YK  date=August 27, 2013 }}.

A 2012 commercial for Capital One credit cards, for which Baldwin was a spokesperson, made a humorous reference to the event: a Viking character from the ad series asks about the phone Baldwin is using, to which Baldwin facetiously replies that it is not to be used on the runway, ending with a chiding "No!"<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.ispot.tv/ad/7VAh/capital-one-battle-speech-featuring-alec-baldwin title=Capital One TV Spot, Battle Speech Featuring Alec Baldwin publisher=iSpot.tv accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> A 2012 Super Bowl commercial for Best Buy also humorously referenced the event.
