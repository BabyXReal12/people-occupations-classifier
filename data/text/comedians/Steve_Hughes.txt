Steve Hughes is an Australian-born black metal drummer, comedian and actor. Hughes has been referred to both by the press and himself as a "Heavy Metal comedian."
Hughes was an active member of Australias early black metal scene.  He founded and played drums for Slaughter Lord, one of the first thrash metal bands in Australia—a band that had a brief yet notable impact on the countrys extreme metal music history.
