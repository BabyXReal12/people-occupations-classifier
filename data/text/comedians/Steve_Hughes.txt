Born in Sydney,<ref name=TNTMAG1/> Hughes became interested in heavy metal in the early 80s.<ref name=MUSICRADAR/> In an interview with MusicRadar Hughes said he became obsessed with Iron Maiden in 1982 and "the pounding drumming of Mr Clive Burr" and was also heavily influenced by Black Sabbath and Dio (band) Dio drummer Vinnie Appice, particularly his work on Dios first 2 albums, which he would repeatedly play while attempting to play along.<ref name=MUSICRADAR/>

In 1985 he founded a band that was originally named Onslaught, but the band was forced to change their name due to a Onslaught (band) UK-based band by the same name.<ref name=ENCYCLOPEDIA/> The band briefly changed their name to Devastator, before settling on Slaughter Lord.<ref name=ENCYCLOPEDIA/> Slaughter Lord released one demo tape titled Taste of Blood before disbanding in 1987.<ref name=SUBGENRES/> In spite of the bands short lifespan, Slaughter Lord had received attention overseas<ref name=SUBGENRES/> and has since been called "legendary"<ref name=ENCYCLOPEDIA/> and "pioneering"<ref name=CURRENCY/> in terms of Australias extreme metal history.
