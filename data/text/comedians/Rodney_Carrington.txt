==Early life==
Rodney Carrington lived in Longview, Texas from 1968 to 1990.
He worked as a comedian in local venues, gaining exposure through radio programs such as The Bob and Tom Show.

==Career==
Carringtons first album, Hangin with Rodney, was released in 1998 via Mercury Records Nashville. This album, composed of both standup comedy and original songs, contained the non-charting single "Letter to My Penis" and peaked at No. 73 on Top Country Albums. He moved to Capitol Nashville for his next album, 2000s Morning Wood. It was his first Top 20 album, and it brought him to the singles charts for the first time with "More of a Man", which reached No. 71 on Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks (now Hot Country Songs). After it came the live album Live: Cmon Laugh You Bastards, which did not chart.

Carringtons third release for Capitol was 2003s Nut Sack. It included the single "Dont Look Now" which reached No. 60. A Greatest Hits package followed in 2004. This album comprised selections from his Capitol recordings on two discs: stand-up routines on one disc, and songs on the other. It also included his first non-comedy song, "Things We Didnt Know." Also in 2004, Carrington made his acting debut in Rodney (TV series) Rodney, a sitcom based largely on his own life which aired on American Broadcasting Company ABC for two seasons.
He released King of the Mountains in 2007, and in 2008 he appeared in the film Beer for My Horses (film) Beer for My Horses.

King of the Mountains contains his second serious song, "Angel Friend", a tribute to his best friend Barry Martin, who died suddenly in 2003.

El Niño Loco, his sixth Capitol album, was released in 2009. The latter album is composed entirely of songs, a first for Carrington. And it also contains his 3rd non-comedy song "Funny Man".

Later in 2009, Carrington released his first Christmas album, Make It Christmas. The first single from the album, "Camouflage and Christmas Lights" became his first Top 40 country hit in December 2009.
==Personal life==
Carrington has a home in south Tulsa, Oklahoma Tulsa a mile away from Bixby, Oklahoma, a Tulsa suburb, where his Rodney (TV series) 2004–2006 sitcom was set.
He was previously married to Teri and has three sons with her.
