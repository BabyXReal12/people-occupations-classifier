He has had little contact with his birth parents, who were not part of his upbringing.

He had a strict Baptist upbringing,

Foxx first told jokes at a comedy clubs open mic night in 1989, after accepting a girlfriends dare. When he found that female comedians were often called first to perform, he changed his name to Jamie Foxx, feeling that it was a name ambiguous enough to disallow any biases.
He chose his surname as a tribute to the black comedian Redd Foxx.
Foxx joined the cast of In Living Color in 1991, where his recurrent character Wanda also shared a name with Redds friend and co-worker, LaWanda Page. Following a recurring role in the comedy-drama sitcom Roc (TV series) Roc,

Foxx made his film debut in the 1992 comedy Toys (film) Toys. His first dramatic role came in Oliver Stones 1999 film Any Given Sunday, where he was cast as a hard-partying American football player,

Three years later, Foxx played taxi driver Max Durocher in the film Collateral (film) Collateral alongside Tom Cruise, for which he received outstanding reviews and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.
