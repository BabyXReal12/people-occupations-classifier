Alex Agnew (born December 22, 1972) is a Belgian stand-up comedian and hard rock lead vocalist vocalist. According to the Nigel Williams autobiography "Had ik maar een vak geleerd" ("If Only Id Learned a Proper Trade"), Alex was already an established comedian in Belgium since at least the 1999-2000 season. This is somewhat contradicted by the 2011 show "Larger than Life", celebrating "the best of Agnew 10 years on stage". Undisputedly however, he attained nationwide fame when he became the first Belgian to win the prestigious Netherlands Dutch Leids Cabaret Festival in February 2003.{{Citation needed date=April 2011}}

His "rock n roll comedy" (as he himself calls it) is mostly a mix of blue comedy and the production of sound effects, similar to Dutch people Dutch-Moroccan people Moroccan comedian Najib Amhali. Besides his comedy activities, he is also the lead vocalist of hard rock band Diablo Blvd.

His first solo comedy show, "KA-BOOM!", spanned the whole 2005-2006 season. Early 2007 Agnew kicked off his new show, "Morimos Solamente".

After filling up the Antwerp Sportpaleis 5 times over throughout 2011 with his best-of show "Larger than Life" supported by Steve Hughes, he is currently touring with his latest show "Interesting Times" throughout 2012 and 2013.
