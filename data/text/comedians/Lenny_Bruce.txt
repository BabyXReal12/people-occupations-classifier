* In 1966, Grace Slick co-wrote and sang the The Great Society (band) Great Society song "Father Bruce".
* In comedian Allan Shermans song Return to Camp Granada, Sherman mentions that Bruce is scheduled to perform at the camp because "the boys are all tired of Mother Goose".  Like the songs previous incarnation Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh (A Letter from Camp) which also enumerates many of the various abominable atrocities occurring at Camp Granada, the songs implication is that parents would be horrified that such an "adult-themed" performer would actually be deemed acceptable entertainment for impressionable young boys at a youth camp, further indicating how despicably debauched and alarmingly "loosely" the camp is being run.
