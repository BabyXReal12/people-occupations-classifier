* In comedian Allan Shermans song Return to Camp Granada, Sherman mentions that Bruce is scheduled to perform at the camp because "the boys are all tired of Mother Goose".  Like the songs previous incarnation Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh (A Letter from Camp) which also enumerates many of the various abominable atrocities occurring at Camp Granada, the songs implication is that parents would be horrified that such an "adult-themed" performer would actually be deemed acceptable entertainment for impressionable young boys at a youth camp, further indicating how despicably debauched and alarmingly "loosely" the camp is being run.
* Bruce is pictured in the top row of the cover of the Beatles 1967 album List of images on the cover of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band
