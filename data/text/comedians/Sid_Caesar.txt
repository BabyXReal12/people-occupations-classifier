Isaac Sidney "Sid" Caesar (September 8, 1922&nbsp;– February 12, 2014) was an American comic actor and writer, best known for two pioneering 1950s live television series: Your Show of Shows, which was a 90-minute weekly show watched by 60 million people, and its successor, Caesars Hour, both of which influenced later generations of comedians.<ref>{{YouTube 78KZl_j8YiM "Sid Caesar remembered as one of TV s early kings of comedy"}}, CBS This Morning, Feb. 13, 2014</ref> Your Show of Shows and its cast received seven Emmy nominations between the years 1953 and 1954 and tallied two wins. He also acted in movies; he played Coach Calhoun in Grease (film) Grease (1978) and its sequel Grease 2 (1982) and appeared in the films Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), Silent Movie (1976), History of the World, Part I (1981), and Cannonball Run II (1984).

Caesar was considered a "sketch comic" and actor, as opposed to a stand-up comedian. He also relied more on body language, accents, and facial contortions than simply dialogue. Unlike the slapstick comedy which was standard on TV, his style was considered "avant garde" in the 1950s. He conjured up ideas and scene and used writers to flesh out the concept and create the dialogue. Among the writers who wrote for Caesar early in their careers were Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Larry Gelbart, Carl Reiner, Michael Stewart (playwright) Michael Stewart, Mel Tolkin, Selma Diamond, and Woody Allen. "Sids was the show to which all comedy writers aspired. It was the place to be," said Steve Allen.

His TV shows subjects included satires of real life events and people—and parodies of popular film genres, theater, television shows, and opera. But unlike other comedy shows at the time, the dialogue was considered sharper, funnier, and more adult-oriented. He was "...best known as one of the most intelligent and provocative innovators of television comedy," who some critics called televisions Charlie Chaplin and The New York Times refers to as the "...comedian of comedians from TVs early days."<ref name=NYT/>

Honored in numerous ways over 60 years, he was nominated for 11 Emmy Awards, winning twice. He was also a saxophonist and author of several books, including two autobiographies in which he described his career and later struggle to overcome years of alcoholism and addiction to barbiturates.

==Early life==
Caesar was the youngest of three sons born to Ashkenazi Jews Jewish immigrants living in Yonkers, New York. His father was Max Ziser (1874–1946) and his mother was Ida (née Raphael) (1887–1975). They likely were from Dąbrowa Tarnowska, Poland.<ref>cite web url=http://jgsgw.org/SidCaeserArticle.pdf</ref>  Reports state that the surname "Caesar" was given to Max, as a child, by an immigration official at Ellis Island.<ref>U.S. Census 1920, Yonkers, NY, enumerators district 205, page 15A, and U.S. Census 1930, Yonkers, NY, enumerators district 60-3, p. 6A</ref><ref>{{cite book   work=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture  title=Sid Caesar   first=Susan  last=Murray   editor1 = Tom Pendergast  editor2=Sara Pendergast   publisher= St.James Press   year=2013   isbn= 978-1558628472}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/70/Sid-Caesar.html  title=Sid Caesar Biography (1922–)  publisher=Filmreference.com  accessdate=2013-12-26}}</ref> This is an urban myth.

By waiting on tables, their son learned to mimic the patois, rhythm and accents of the diverse clientele, a technique he termed double-talk, which he used throughout his career. He first tried double-talk with a group of Italians, his head barely reaching above the table.

==Career==

During the summer of 1942, Caesar met his future wife, Florence Levy, at the Avon Lodge in the Catskills village of Woodridge, New York. They were married on July 17, 1943,<ref>{{cite book  url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5jr9L--C4tMC&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=sid+caesar+married+July+17,+1943&source=bl&ots=ZR1TtYw7h8&sig=nZSrQlYGG5_N9kgQhFr196k9zos&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2er8Up2FKZG7oQSk0oGQBQ&ved=0CF8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=sid%20caesar%20married%20July%2017%2C%201943&f=false   title= The Great Clowns of American Television  first= Karin   last= Adir   publisher = McFarland & Company   year = 2001   page=64  isbn=978-0786413034}}</ref> and had three children: Michele, Rick and Karen.<ref name=MuseumTV /> After joining the musicians union, he briefly played with Shep Fields, Claude Thornhill, Charlie Spivak, Art Mooney and Benny Goodman.<ref name=MuseumTV>{{cite web  url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/caesarsid.htm  quote= accessdate=2014-02-12  title=Sid Caesar  publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications   archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140216005056/http://www.museum.tv/eotv/caesarsid.htm   archivedate=February 16, 2014  deadurl = no}}</ref> Later in his career, he performed Sing, Sing, Sing (With a Swing) "Sing, Sing, Sing" with Goodman for a TV performance.<ref>video: {{YouTube UkMl3-Rmjt8 Sid Caesar performing "Sing, Sing, Sing" with Benny Goodman and his orchestra}}</ref>

Still in the service, Caesar was ordered to Palm Beach, Florida, where Vernon Duke and Howard Dietz were putting together a service revue called Tars and Spars. There he met the civilian director of the show, Max Liebman. When Caesars comedy got bigger applause than the musical numbers, Liebman asked him to do stand-up bits between the songs. Tars and Spars toured nationally, and became Caesars first major gig as a comedian.<ref name="clips"/> Liebman later produced Caesars first television series.

After the war, the Caesars moved to Hollywood. In 1946, Columbia Pictures produced a film version of Tars and Spars in which Caesar reprised his role. The next year, he acted in The Guilt of Janet Ames. He turned down the lead of The Jolson Story as he did not want to be known as an impersonator, and turned down several other offers to play sidekick roles.<ref name="Auto2" />  He soon returned to New York, where he became the opening act for Joe E. Lewis at the Copacabana (nightclub) Copacabana nightclub.  He reunited with Liebman, who guided his stage material and presentation. That job led to a contract with the William Morris Agency and a nationwide tour. Caesar also performed in a Broadway revue, Make Mine Manhattan, which featured The Five Dollar Date—one of his first original pieces, in which he sang, acted, double-talked, pantomimed, and wrote the music.<ref name="LATobit"/> He won a 1948 Donaldson Awards Donaldson Award for his contributions to the musical.<ref name=Auto2/><ref name=VarietyObit>{{cite news author=Richard Natale  url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/sid-caesar-master-of-tv-comedy-dies-at-91-1201100019/  title=Sid Caesar Dead, Iconic Comedian Dies At 91  publisher=Variety (magazine) Variety  date=2014-02-12  accessdate=2014-02-13}}</ref>

The Friday show was simultaneously broadcast on National Broadcasting Corporation NBC and the DuMont Television Network DuMont network, and was an immediate success. However, its sponsor, Admiral (electrical appliances) Admiral, an appliance company, could not keep up with the demand for its new television sets, so the show was cancelled after 26 weeks—ironically, on account of its runaway success.<ref name="LATobit"/>

On February 25, 1950, Caesar appeared in the first episode of Your Show of Shows, initially the second half of the two-hour umbrella show, Saturday Night Review; at the end of the 1950–51 season, Your Show of Shows became its own, 90-minute program from the International Theatre at 5 Columbus Circle and later The Center Theatre at Sixth Avenue and 49th Street. <ref name=brooksmarshp1344>Brooks, Marsh, p. 1344.</ref> Burgess Meredith hosted the first two shows,<ref name=brooksmarshp1344 /> and the premiere featured musical guests Gertrude Lawrence, Lily Pons and Robert Merrill.<ref name=Auto2/> The show was a mix of sketch comedy, movie and television satires, Caesars monologues, musical guests, and large production numbers. Guests included: Jackie Cooper, Robert Preston (actor) Robert Preston, Rex Harrison, Eddie Albert, Michael Redgrave, Basil Rathbone, Charlton Heston, Geraldine Page, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Pearl Bailey, Fred Allen, Benny Goodman, Lena Horne and many other stars of the time. It was also responsible for bringing together the comedy team of Caesar, Coca, Carl Reiner, and Howard Morris. Many writers also got their break creating the shows sketches, including Lucille Kallen, Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Michael Stewart (playwright) Michael Stewart, Mel Tolkin and Sheldon Keller. Sid Caesar won his first Emmy in 1952. In 1951 and 1952, he was voted the United States Best Comedian in Motion Picture Daily{{}}s TV poll. The show ended after almost 160 episodes<ref name="Auto2"/> on June 5, 1954.<ref name=brooksmarshp1344 />

A few months later, Caesar returned with Caesars Hour, a one-hour sketch/variety show with Morris, Reiner, Bea Arthur and other members of his former crew. Nanette Fabray replaced Coca, who had left to star in her own short-lived series. Ultimate creative and technical control was now in Caesars hands, originating from the Century Theatre (New York City) Century Theater<ref name="Auto2"/> and the weekly budget doubled to $125,000.<ref name="Auto2"/> The premiere on September 27, 1954, featured Gina Lollobrigida.<ref name="Auto2"/> Everything was performed live, including the commercials.{{citation needed date=February 2014}}

Caesars Hour was followed by ABCs short-lived Sid Caesar Invites You from January 26 to May 25, 1958. It briefly reunited Caesar, Coca, and Reiner, with Simon and Brooks among the writers.<ref>Brooks, Marsh, pp. 1068–69.</ref>

In 1963, Caesar appeared on television, on stage, and in the movies. Several As Caesar Sees It specials evolved into the 1963–64 Sid Caesar Show (which alternated with Edie Adams in Heres Edie). He starred with Virginia Martin in the Broadway musical Little Me (musical) Little Me, with book by Simon, choreography by Bob Fosse, and music by Cy Coleman. Playing eight parts with 32 costume changes, he was nominated in 1963 for a Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical.<ref name=BWWorld>{{cite web url=http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1963#  title=1963 Tony Award Winners  publisher=BroadwayWorld.com  accessdate=2014-02-12}}</ref> On film, Caesar and Adams played a husband and wife drawn into a mad race to find buried loot in the 1963 comedy extravaganza Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.

===Style and technique===
Caesar was not a stand-up comedian but a "sketch comic, and actor," wrote one historian. "He conjured up ideas and enhanced scenes, but never wrote a word," and thereby depended on his writers for dialogue.<ref name=Nachman>{{cite book  last1= Nachman  first1=Gerald  author-link1= Gerald Nachman (journalist)  title=Seriously Funny  script-title=The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s url=http://geraldnachman.com/about.html  location=New York, NY  publisher=Pantheon Books  publication-date=2003   pages= 99–122  isbn=  9780375410307 <!-- 0375410309 -->  oclc=50339527   trans-title=  author-mask1=  date=  year=  orig-year=  editor1-last=  editor1-first=  editor1-link=  editor1-mask=  display-editors=  type=  language=  edition=  page=  access-date=  quote=  postscript=  ref= }}

File:Sid Caesar - 1972-1.jpg thumb left Caesar in 1972
His sketches were often long, sometimes 10 or 15 minutes, with numerous close-ups showing the expressions on the faces of Caesar and other actors. Caesar relied more on body language, accents, and facial contortions than simply spoken dialogue. Unlike the slapstick comedy, which was standard on TV, his style was considered avant garde.<ref name=Nachman/> Caesar "...was born with the ability to write physical poetry," notes comedian Steve Allen,<ref name=Nachman /> a technique like that used for a silent film comedian.<ref name=Nachman /> An example of this "silent film" style is a live sketch with Nanette Fabray, where they both pantomime with careful choreography, having an argument with music by Beethoven in the background.<ref>{{YouTube 9QSvGnDd4m4 "Sid Caesar & Nannette Fabry - Argument to Beethovens 5th"}}, video clip</ref>

Writer Mel Tolkin stated that Caesar "didnt like one-line jokes in sketches because he felt that if the joke was a good one, anybody could do it. One-liners would take him away from what drove his personal approach to comedy."<ref name=Nachman/> Larry Gelbart called Caesars style theatrical, and called him "...a pure TV comedian."<ref name=Nachman/> In describing his control during the live performances, actress Nanette Fabray recalled that unlike most comedians, such as Red Skelton, Bob Hope or Milton Berle, Caesar always stayed in character: "He was so totally into the scene he never lost it."<ref name=Nachman />

Caesar was able to pantomime a wide variety of things: a tire, a gumball machine, a lion, a dog, a punching bag, a telephone, an infant, an elevator, a railroad train, a herd of horses, a piano, a rattlesnake and a bottle of seltzer.<ref name=Nachman/> On the Dick Clark show in 1978, he played a chewing gum machine and a slot machine.<ref>{{YouTube zAfphVDJems "Sid Caesar on Dick Clarks Life Wednesday show"}}, 1978</ref> He was also able to create imaginary characters. Alfred Hitchcock compared him to Charlie Chaplin, and critic John Crosby felt "he could wrench laughter out of you with the violence of his great eyes and the sheer immensity of his parody."<ref name=Nachman/> In an article in The Saturday Evening Post in 1953, show business biographer Maurice Zolotow noted that "Caesar relies upon grunts and grimaces to express a vast range of emotions."<ref name=Nachman/>

Of his double-talk routines, Carl Reiner said, "His ability to doubletalk every language known to man was impeccable,"<ref name="Reuters">{{cite news  last=Dobuzinskis  first=Alex  url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/12/us-sidcaesar-idUSBREA1B20H20140212  title=Comic legend Sid Caesar dies at 91  publisher=Reuters  accessdate=2014-02-13}}</ref> and during one performance Caesar imitated four different languages but with almost no real words.<ref>{{YouTube 2SqEmkwADmY "Sid Caesar performing in four different languages"}}, video clip</ref> Despite his apparent fluency in many languages, Caesar could actually speak only English and Yiddish language Yiddish. In 2008, Caesar told a USA Today reporter, "Every language has its own music ... If you listen to a language for 15 minutes, you know the rhythm and song."<ref>{{cite news  last=Keveney  first=Bill  url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-01-08-sid-caesar_N.htm  title=Sid Caesar is the showman of showmen who keeps on laughing  publisher=USA Today  date=2008-01-09  accessdate=2014-02-13}}</ref> Having developed this mimicry skill, he could create entire monologues using gibberish in numerous languages, as he did in a skit in which he played a German general.<ref>{{YouTube 5m6Czgl1acU "Sid Caesar as "The German General"}}, video clip</ref>

===Subjects===
Among his primary subjects were parodies and spoofs of various film genres, including gangster films, westerns, newspaper dramas, spy movies and other TV shows. Unlike other comedy shows at the time, the dialogue on his shows were considered sharper, funnier and more adult oriented.<ref name=Nachman/> In his sketches for Your Show of Shows and Caesars Hour, he would also typically "skewer the minutiae of domestic life" along with lampooning popular or classic movies.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news   url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/13/arts/television/sid-caesar-comic-who-blazed-tv-trail-dies-at-91.html   title = Sid Caesar, Comedian of Comedians From TV’s Early Days, Dies at 91  work = The New York Times   first= Mervyn   last= Rothstein   first2=Peter   last2=Keepnews   date= February 12, 2014   accessdate= 2014-02-13}}</ref>

Contemporary movies, foreign movies, theater, television shows and opera were targets of satire by the writing team. Often the publicity generated by the sketches boosted the box office of the original productions. Some notable sketches included: "From Here to Obscurity" (From Here to Eternity), "Aggravation Boulevard" (Sunset Boulevard (film) Sunset Boulevard), "Hat Basterson" (Bat Masterson (TV series) Bat Masterson), and "No West for the Wicked" (Stagecoach (1939 film) Stagecoach).

They also performed some recurring sketches. "The Hickenloopers", televisions first bickering-couple sketch, predated The Honeymooners. As "The Professor", Caesar was the daffy expert who bluffed his way through his interviews with earnest roving reporter Carl Reiner. In its various incarnations, "The Professor" could be Gut von Fraidykat (mountain-climbing expert), Ludwig von Spacebrain (space expert), or Ludwig von Henpecked (marriage expert). Later, "The Professor" was inspiration for Mel Brooks "The Two Thousand Year Old Man".{{citation needed date=September 2016}} The most prominent recurring sketch on the show was "The Commuters", which featured Caesar, Reiner, and Morris involved with everyday working and suburban life situations. Years later, the sketch "Sneaking through the Sound Barrier", a parody of the British film The Sound Barrier, ran continuously as part of a display on supersonic flight at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

===Working with writers===
File:Sidcaesarpic.jpg thumb Caesar in 1980
Steve Allen claimed, "Sids was the show to which all comedy writers aspired. It was the place to be."<ref name=Nachman/> While Caesar did not write his dialogue, he made all final decisions. His writers, such as Mel Brooks, felt they "had a great instrument in Caesar that we could all play, and we played it very well."<ref name=Nachman/> As for Caesar, Nachman describes him basically as an "inspired idea man who allowed the writers to take more risks" than other TV shows.<ref name=Nachman/> Woody Allen remembers that "...you wrote situations," instead of jokes, as in "This Is Your Story" with Carl Reiner, a parody of the popular TV show This is Your Life.<ref>{{YouTube N-gOQp1Iddc "Sid Caesar in "This Is Your Story"}}, video clip</ref><ref>{{cite news  last=Margolick  first=David  url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2014/02/sid-caesars-finest-sketch.html  title=Sid Caesars Finest Your Show of Shows Sketch  publisher=The New Yorker  accessdate=2014-02-14}}</ref> It was said to be "Caesars personal favorite" sketch.<ref name=Nachman/>

In many cases, sketch dialogue was not even written down, but simply indicated by describing a scene, as in, "Sid does man coming home from business mad."<ref name=Nachman/> Sometimes, said Larry Gelbart, it was "organized chaos," and when watching the writers create from offstage, felt, "...it was a religious experience."<ref name=Nachman/> To Mel Brooks, "it was a zoo. Everyone pitched lines at Sid. Jokes would be changed fifty times."<ref name=Nachman/> Naturally there were some explosive episodes: "Mr. Caesar once dangled a terrified Mr. Brooks from an 18th-story window until colleagues restrained him. With one punch, he knocked out a horse that had thrown his wife off its back, a scene that Mr. Brooks replayed in his movie Blazing Saddles."<ref name=Nachman/>

Neil Simon recalled that after writing out a sketch and giving it to Caesar, "Sid would make it ten times funnier than what we wrote. Sid acted everything out, so the sketches we did were like little plays."<ref name=Nachman/> Simon also remembered the impact that working for Caesar had on him: "The first time I saw Caesar it was like seeing a new country. All other comics were basically doing situations with farcical characters. Caesar was doing life."<ref name=Nachman/>

Some of his writers, like Woody Allen, initially didnt like being among the large team of writers coming up with routines for Caesar, feeling it was too competitive and contributed to hostility among writers. An Allen biographer wrote that Allen "...chafed under the atmosphere of inspired spontaneity", although Allen did say that, "Writing for Caesar was the highest thing you could aspire to—at least as a TV comedy writer. Only the presidency was above that."<ref name=Nachman/> Neil Simon noted that "we were competitive the way a family is competitive to get dads attention. We all wanted to be Sids favorite."<ref name=Nachman/> As part of the competitive atmosphere in The Writers Room, as it was called, friendship was also critical. Larry Gelbart explained:

{{quote We were able to be urbane. Between us we read every book. Between us we saw every movie. Between us we saw every play on Broadway. You could make jokes about Kafka or Tennessee Williams. We also had dinner together. We went to movies together. We were all friends. And that was very important. We appreciated each other a lot.<ref name=Maslon>Maslon, Laurence. Makeem Laugh, Hachette Book Group (2008) pp. 75–79</ref>}}

===Impact on television===
Nachman concludes that "the Caesar shows were the crème de la crème of fifties television," as they were "studded with satire, and their sketches sharper, edgier, more sophisticated than the other variety shows."<ref name=Nachman/> Likewise, historian Susan Murray notes that Caesar was "...best known as one of the most intelligent and provocative innovators of television comedy."<ref name=Murray>Murray, pp. 408–409</ref>

According to actress Nanette Fabray, who acted alongside Caesar, "He was the first original TV comedy creation."<ref name=Nachman/> His early shows were the "...gold standard for TV sketch comedy."<ref name=Nachman/> In 1951, Newsweek noted that according to "the opinion of lots of smart people, Caesar is the best that TV has to offer,"<ref name=Nachman/> while Zolotow, in his 1953 profile for The Saturday Evening Post, wrote that "in temperament, physique, and technique of operation, Caesar represents a new species of comedian."<ref name=Nachman/>

However, his positive impact on television became a negative one for Broadway. Caesar fans preferred to stay home on Saturday nights to watch his show instead of seeing live plays. "The Caesar show became such a Saturday-night must-see habit—the Saturday Night Live of its day," states Nachman, that "...Broadway producers begged NBC to switch the show to midweek."<ref name=Nachman/> Comedy star Carol Burnett, who later had her own hit TV show, remembers winning tickets to see My Fair Lady on Broadway: "I gave the tickets to my roommate because I said, Fair Ladys gonna be running for a hundred years, but Sid Caesar is live and Ill never see that again."<ref name=Maslon/>

===Faded success and personal problems===
After nearly 10 years as a prime-time star of television comedy with Your Show of Shows followed by Caesars Hour, his stardom ended rapidly and he nearly disappeared from the spotlight. Nachman describes this period:

{{quote Caesar slid into a personal and career abyss ... [he] had no interest in movies ... He would live and die by the tube. His career was short-circuited by alcohol and pills ... The pressures of sudden stardom, of headlining and co-producing a weekly hit show, crushed him.<ref name=Nachman/>}}

Caesar himself felt, "It had all come too fast, was too easy, and he didnt deserve the acclaim."<ref name=Nachman/> Writer Mel Brooks, who also became his close friend, said, "I know of no other comedian, including Chaplin, who could have done nearly ten years of live television. Nobodys talent was ever more used up than Sids. He was one of the greatest artists ever born. But over a period of years, television ground him into sausages."<ref name=Nachman/>

In 1977, after blacking out during a stage performance of Neil Simons The Last of the Red Hot Lovers in Regina, Saskatchewan, Caesar gave up alcohol "cold turkey". In his 1982 autobiography, Where Have I Been?, and his second book, Caesars Hours, he chronicled his struggle to overcome his alcoholism and addiction to Barbiturate sleeping pills.

Of the couples meeting, Florence said, "Well, I thought he was nice for the summer ... I thought he would be just a nice boyfriend for the summer. He was cute-looking and tall, over six feet.... I was in my last year at Hunter College; we were still dating when Sid went into the service, the Coast Guard. Luckily he was stationed in New York so we were able to continue seeing each other, even though my parents werent too happy about it. They never thought he would amount to anything, that hed never have a real career or make any money. But we were married one year after we met, in July of 1943." She also pointed out, "You know, hes not funny all the time. He can be very serious." At the time of the interview, the couple had been married for 66 years.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://tolucantimes.info/section/inside-this-issue/florence-caesar/  title=Florence Caesar  publisher=Tolucan Times The Tolucan Times  date=2009-11-11  accessdate=2014-02-14  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222212436/http://tolucantimes.info/section/inside-this-issue/florence-caesar/  archivedate=2014-02-22  df= }}</ref> Florence Caesar died on March 3, 2010, aged 88.<ref name=NYT/><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.tributes.com/show/Florence-L.-Caesar-88156927  title=Florence Caesar Obituary - Beverly Hills, California  publisher=Tributes.com  accessdate=2014-02-14}}</ref>

On Caesars death, Carl Reiner said, "He was the ultimate, he was the very best sketch artist and comedian that ever existed."

And I was privileged to be one of his writers and one of his friends."<ref name="Reuters"/> Jon Stewart and The Daily Show paid tribute to Caesar at the shows close on February 12, 2014.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-february-12-2014/moment-of-zen---sid-caesar-tribute  title=Sid Caesar Tribute - The Daily Show with Jon Stewart - 02/12/14 (Video Clip)  publisher=TheDailyShow.com  date=2014-02-12  accessdate=2014-02-14}}</ref> Vanity Fair (magazine) Vanity Fair republished a brief tribute written by Billy Crystal in August 2005, in which he said of Caesar and his contemporaries:

{{quote I get nervous when I am with these giants. I always feel like I want to say, Thank you. I am blessed to have grown up in their time of perfection, to have witnessed the utter force of Sid. Live, uncut, daring but not risqué. Never stooping beneath themselves, Sid and this team of icons put forth a raucous, hilarious, and truthful brand of comedy that, 50 years later, is still funny and inspiring, and makes me think ... What kind of comedy would I be doing if I hadnt seen Sid Caesar? Would I be a comedian at all?<ref>{{cite news  last=Crystal  first=Billy  url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/sid-caesar-billy-crystal  title=All Hail Caesar  work=Vanity Fair  date=August 2005  accessdate=2014-02-13}}</ref>}}
