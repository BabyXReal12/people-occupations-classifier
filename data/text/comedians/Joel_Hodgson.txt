MST3K originally aired on KTMA, before becoming one of the first two shows to be picked up by the Comedy Channel, the forerunner of Comedy Central. The other show, also created and written by Hodgson, was the short-lived Higgins Boys and Gruber, a sketch comedy program that starred Steve Higgins, David Anthony Higgins and Dave Allen.

Hodgson surprised many fans when he left MST3K after its 107th episode, Mitchell (film) Mitchell in 1993.  Hodgsons departure was scripted into the episode with the robot, Gypsy, ejecting Joel from the Satellite of Love in an escape pod after incorrectly believing Joels captors were plotting to kill him. Michael J. Nelson replaced Hodgson on the series as host for the remainder of the series run. In contemporary interviews, Hodgson stated he was uncomfortable with acting and being in front of the camera, citing that as the reason he quit the show.<ref name="mst3kinfo">{{cite web   last = Henry   first = Brian   url = http://mst3k.com/mstfaq/wbrains.html   title = MST3K FAQ -- West Brains: Aliens in L.A.   publisher = MST3K Info Club   accessdate = 2007-05-24  archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070414091957/http://www.mst3k.com/mstfaq/wbrains.html  archivedate = April 14, 2007}}</ref>
During a 1999 interview with The A.V. Club, Hodgson added that he and producer Jim Mallon had been fighting over creative control of MST3K. His departure allowed the show to continue and gave him the opportunity to focus more on his preferred creation and production work than on performing, which he did only reluctantly.<ref name="onion">{{cite news last=Phipps  first=Keith  title=Joel Hodgson  pages=  publisher=The Onion A.V.

Hodgson later made a surprise guest appearance in the season premiere for the final season of MST3K ("Soultaker," episode 1001).

In a 2008 Slashdot interview, Hodgson admitted that he felt leaving MST3K "was a bit of a personal tragedy," and that he had "...created the appearance to the press that I had other plans, but I didnt. It was all to keep [MST3K] alive." He also stated that he felt his run on MST3K "...was the perfect job."<ref name="slashdot">{{cite web last= url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/25/1457218 title=Joel Hodgson Answers  publisher= Slashdot date=2008-01-25 accessdate=11 December 2014 }}</ref>

In a 2008 interview with Public Radio Internationals The Sound of Young America, Hodgson said of his departure from MST3K, "I was, like, totally happy at Mystery Science Theater. I loved it. I wanted to stay, but I was basically having a fight with my partner, Jim Mallon.  So we werent getting along and so I just felt like -- I thought it really could possibly jeopardize the show. It would have been easy to create factions out of the group.  And by that time it would not have been a fun show to work on.  And so, I felt like I saw it coming and I just thought [leaving] was the best thing at the time."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.maximumfun.org/blog/2008/02/podcast-joel-hodgson-frank-conniff-and.html title=Podcast: Joel Hodgson, Frank Conniff and J.
