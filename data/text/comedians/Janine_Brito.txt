Kamau Bell.  In addition to writing on the series, Brito frequently appeared on air in pieces covering topics like Miss Fire Island, LGBTQ athletes, and the "war on women."

==Comedy style==
Her colleague and longtime friend W. Kamau Bell describes Brito as “a sarcastic, snarky smart bomb of comedy funk straight from the 80′s.”<ref>{{cite web title=Janine Brito - ABOUT url=http://www.janinebrito.com/about accessdate=November 10,  2013}}</ref>  Brito is often placed within the alternative comedy scene and tends to focus on issues of gender, race (human classification) race, and sexuality. She frequently derives humor from her half-Cubans Cuban background and her childhood fixation on worrying about being the Antichrist. She is also known for her sartorial choices and frequent donning of neckties. An article written by feminist website Feministing, says her comedy is "a punch in the face of convention and offers a refreshing departure from the straight, white, male narrative that usually relies on tired tropes and stereotypes."<ref name="feministing"  />

Brito won the SF Women’s Comedy Competition in 2009 and the Silver Nail Award from local SF bcasting network Rooftop Comedy.
