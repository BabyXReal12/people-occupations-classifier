He graduated from Mount Vernon High School (Ohio) Mount Vernon High School in 1944, and then studied drama at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where his fellow students included Cloris Leachman, Charlotte Rae, Patricia Neal, Jeffrey Hunter and Claude Akins.

==Career==
Lynde made his Broadway theatre Broadway debut in the hit revue New Faces of 1952 in which he co-starred with fellow newcomers Eartha Kitt, Robert Clary, Alice Ghostley, and Carol Lawrence.<ref name="what-a-c">{{cite web  author=  title=Paul Lynde  url=http://www.what-a-character.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=LyndeP  publisher=What A Character!  date=  accessdate=2008-01-25  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010082557/https://www.what-a-character.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi?id=LyndeP  archivedate=2007-10-10  df=}}</ref> In his monologue from that revue, the "Trip of the Month Club," Lynde portrayed a man on crutches recounting his misadventures on the African safari he took with his late wife.<ref>{{cite news   author=Vincent Canby   title=A Lost Theatrical Form Returns With a Smile   url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?_r=1&res=9E01E0DD133DF932A15755C0A96E958260&oref=slogin   work=The New York Times   date=21 June 1998   accessdate=2008-01-25}}</ref> The show was filmed and released as New Faces (film) New Faces in 1954.
File:Uncle arthur bewitched 1968.JPG thumb left 180px Lynde as Uncle Arthur with Elizabeth Montgomery in the 1968 Bewitched episode, "The No Harm Charm"

After the revues run, Lynde co-starred in the short-lived 1956 sitcom Stanley (television series) Stanley opposite Buddy Hackett and Carol Burnett, both of whom were also starting their careers in show business. That year, he guest starred on NBCs The Martha Raye Show.

Lynde returned to Broadway in 1960 when he was cast as Harry MacAfee, the father in Bye Bye Birdie. He also played the role in the Bye Bye Birdie (film) 1963 film adaptation. That year, he recorded a live album, Recently Released, issued as an LP record. All six tracks were written by him. Once he could afford writers, he rarely used his own material until his tenure on Hollywood Squares years later.

Lynde was in great demand in the 1960s. During the 1961-62 television season he was a regular on NBCs The Perry Como Show as part of the Kraft Music Hall players with Don Adams, Kaye Ballard and Sandy Stewart (singer) Sandy Stewart. He was a familiar face on many sitcoms, including The Phil Silvers Show, The Patty Duke Show, The Munsters, The Flying Nun, Gidget (TV series) Gidget, I Dream of Jeannie, F Troop, and variety shows such as The Ed Sullivan Show and The Dean Martin Show. He also was featured in a number of 1960s films, including Send Me No Flowers and The Glass Bottom Boat, both starring Doris Day.

Lyndes best known sitcom role was on Bewitched, where he made his debut appearance in the first-season episode "Driving Is the Only Way to Fly." His role as Samantha Stephens nervous driving instructor Harold Harold was well received by viewers, as well as series star Elizabeth Montgomery and her husband, director/producer William Asher, with whom Lynde became good friends. Asher then created the recurring role of Endoras practical-joking brother List of Bewitched characters#Uncle Arthur Uncle Arthur. Lynde made 10 appearances on Bewitched as the beloved character, and was regularly seen with Montgomery and Asher off the set as well.<ref name=salon/>

Lynde also did extensive voice actor voice work on animated cartoons, particularly those of Hanna-Barbera Productions. His most notable roles included The Hooded Claw in The Perils of Penelope Pitstop, Mildew Wolf from Its the Wolf (a segment of Cattanooga Cats), and Pertwee from Wheres Huddles?. He also voiced gluttonous rat Templeton in the animated feature Charlottes Web (1973 film) Charlottes Web. Lyndes sardonic inflections added a dimension to such lines as the sly, drawn-out whine, "Whats in it for meeee?" His distinctive voice remains popular among impressionists. Although it is sometimes assumed that actress Alice Ghostley based her speech patterns and mannerisms on Lyndes, according to actress Kaye Ballard "it was Paul who was influenced by Alice".<ref>{{cite news   author= Dennis McLellan   title = Bewitcheds Esmeralda Dies at 81   url = http://www.zap2it.com/news/zap-aliceghostleyobit,0,7769067.story   work = The Los Angeles Times   date = 22 September 2007   accessdate = 2013-07-29}}</ref>

===Hollywood Squares===
{{tone section date=June 2018}}
In 1966, Lynde debuted on the fledgling game show Hollywood Squares and quickly became its iconic guest star.  Eventually he assumed a permanent spot as the "center square," a move which ensured that he would be called upon by contestants at least once in almost every round. Despite an urban legend to the contrary, Lynde remained in the center at the producers discretion.

On Hollywood Squares Lynde was best able to showcase his comedic talents with short, salty one-liners, spoken in his signature sniggering delivery.<ref name="biog" /> Many gags were thinly veiled allusions to his homosexuality. Asked, "Youre the worlds most popular fruit. What are you?" Lynde replied, "Humble."<ref>http://www.life.com/gallery/41132/image/2192797 {{dead link date=June 2016 bot=medic}}{{cbignore bot=medic}}</ref> Asked how many men on a hockey team, Lynde said, "Oh, about half." Asked, "Whos generally better looking, a fairy or a pixie?," he objected, "Looks arent everything!" and then, after a pause, quipped, "I think Ill take the fairy." Asked whether it was against the law in Texas to call a marine a "sissy," Lynde quipped, "I guess Ill have to take the law into my own hands."<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.PaulLynde.info/audioclips/Other/audioclips.htm  title=Paul Lynde Clips  publisher=Paullynde.info  date=1960-06-05  accessdate=2013-09-21  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017153440/http://paullynde.info/audioclips/Other/audioclips.htm  archivedate=2013-10-17  df= }}</ref>

Other jokes relied on double entendre, an alleged fondness for deviant behaviors, his misogyny, or dealt with touchy subject matter for 1970s television. Examples include:
: Q: "What unusual thing do you do if you have something called the gift of tongues?"
: Lynde: "I wouldnt tell the grand jury. Why should I tell you?"

: Q: "The great writer George Bernard Shaw once wrote, Its such a wonderful thing, what a crime to waste it on children. What is it?"	
: Lynde: "A whipping."<ref>Zingers from the Hollywood Squares LP, Event Records, 1974</ref><ref>Paul Lynde: Off Center, A&E Home Video, 2001</ref>

: Q: "Paul, any good boat enthusiast should know that when a man falls out of your boat and into the water, you should yell Man overboard! Now what should you yell if a woman falls overboard?"
: Lynde: "Full speed ahead!"<ref>I Love the 70s: 1971, VH1, 2003</ref>

Lynde garnered considerable fame and wealth from the series, appearing a total of 707 times.<ref>Peter Marshall (entertainer) Peter Marshall Kaye Ballard (E True Hollywood Story, 2000)</ref> He bought Errol Flynns old Hollywood mansion<ref name=gazette/> and spent an enormous amount of money on renovations and decorations.

===The Paul Lynde Show and Temperatures Rising===
In 1972, Lynde starred in a short-lived American Broadcasting Company ABC sitcom, The Paul Lynde Show, playing an uptight attorney and father at odds with his liberal-minded son-in-law. The series was a contractual fulfillment to ABC in place of an aborted ninth season of Bewitched.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.biography.com/people/paul-lynde-9542425#synopsis title=Paul Lynde website=Biography.com language=en-us access-date=2017-01-25}}</ref>{{Citation needed date=July 2013}}

Lynde starred as Paul Simms, the father of a family that consisted of wife Martha (Elizabeth Allen (actress) Elizabeth Allen) and daughters Barbara (Jane Actman) and Sally (Pamelyn Ferdin). It also starred John Calvin as Barbaras husband, Howie, and Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara as Howies parents. Critics perceived the show as a derivative of All in the Family, then televisions most-popular primetime program, although many admitted the writing was top notch and the sexual connotations gave it an extra bit of spice. Lynde was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy Best Actor Golden Globe for the show. Scheduled opposite the first half of the Top 30 hit The Carol Burnett Show on CBS and the Top 20 hit Adam-12 on NBC, the series garnered low ratings and was canceled after a single season.{{Citation needed date=July 2013}}

Media reports at the time about ABC programs indicated that research showed viewers liked another ABC show, Temperatures Rising, but disliked star James Whitmore, whereas viewers liked Lynde but not The Paul Lynde Show. Therefore, the network and producer William Asher decided to dismiss Whitmore and combine the positive elements of both series. Lynde was "transferred" to Temperatures Rising for the 1973–74 season. The trick backfired and the ratings for The New Temperatures Rising were even lower than the previous season. ABC cancelled the show and its time slot was taken by mid-season replacement Happy Days. ABC decided to resuscitate the program, with additional cast changes (most notably, Alice Ghostley replaced Sudie Bond in the role of Lyndes sister, Edwina) and a new premise, in the summer of 1974, when it ran for two months. Neither actors presence in the cast helped the shows sinking ratings and the series was cancelled for good.

In addition to the unsuccessful The Paul Lynde Show and Temperatures Rising, Lynde starred in four failed television pilots in the 1960s:

* Howie (1962, CBS)
* Twos Company (1965, ABC)
* Sedgewick Hawk-Styles: Prince of Danger (1966, ABC)
* Manley and the Mob (1967, ABC)

Of the four shows, only the Victorian detective spoof Sedgewick Hawk-Styles: Prince of Danger was initially picked up by ABC, only to be cancelled at the last minute. William Asher commented in the A&E (TV channel) A&E Biography (TV series) Biography entry on Lynde that ABC had reservations about Lynde, most notably his increasingly erratic offscreen behavior and the persistent rumors of his homosexuality.<ref name="biog"/>

Lynde was regularly admired by his peers during his lifetime. Mel Brooks once described Lynde as being capable of getting laughs by reading "a phone book, tornado alert, or seed catalogue."<ref name=salon/> In 1976, Lynde received an Entertainer of the Year Emmy award for being voted the funniest man of the year, which he immediately turned over to host Jackie Gleason (who never won an Emmy award during his lifetime), citing him as "the funniest man ever." The unexpected gesture shocked Gleason.

===Summer stock theatre===

==Final years==
File:The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour Paul Lynde Nancy Walker 1975.jpg thumb right The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour (1975) with Nancy Walker 
Lyndes continuing popularity led to his being signed by ABC to host a series of specials from 1975 to 1979, including:
*The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour (November 6, 1975) with Jack Albertson, Nancy Walker and the The Osmonds Osmond Brothers;
*The Paul Lynde Halloween Special (October 29, 1976) featuring the first prime-time network appearance of Kiss (band) KISS, along with Margaret Hamilton (actress) Margaret Hamilton recreating her role as the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) The Wizard of Oz. Hamilton and Billie Hayes (as H.R. Pufnstufs Witchiepoo) teamed up in a skit where they ask Lynde to help them improve their (witches) image. Other guests included Betty White, Donny Osmond Donny and Marie Osmond, Tim Conway, and Roz Kelly;
*The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour (April 23, 1977) with Cloris Leachman and Tony Randall;

*Paul Lynde Goes M-A-A-A-AD (May 20, 1979) with Marie Osmond, Charo and Vicki Lawrence.

Lynde was a regular guest on the 1976–79 variety show Donny & Marie (1976 TV series) Donny & Marie until 1978. He lost his guest-starring role following an alcohol-related arrest.<ref>{{cite web   last =   first =   title = Paul Lynde Arrested   publisher=The Item The Daily Item  date = 4 January 1978  url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&dat=19780104&id=nYciAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bqoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4795,1302171   accessdate = 2013-07-29}}</ref> 

As demand for his services declined, he accepted a wider variety of job offers. He appeared as a guest weatherman for WTVG WSPD-TV in Toledo, Ohio in 1978, to publicize both Hollywood Squares and a summer stock performance.<ref>{{cite web   title = Paul Lynde doing the Weather   url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX_igvcBICc   accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref> He appeared as Indian chief Nervous Elk alongside former Bye Bye Birdie co-star Ann-Margret in the 1979 comedy The Villain (1979 film) The Villain (released as "Cactus Jack" in the UK), which was to be his final film role. Lynde had become disenchanted with being what he called "boxed into" Hollywood Squares and departed the series that same year. Acting jobs continued to be scarce, although it is unclear if this was due to Lyndes known substance abuse and alcohol problems, which made him difficult to work with.<ref name=salon/>

In 1980, Hollywood Squares was experiencing a downward trend in Nielsen ratings. Lynde was approached about returning to the program and initially declined, but changed his mind when told he would receive co-star billing with host Peter Marshall. He returned to the series in the spring of 1980 and remained with the show until its cancellation in February 1981.

In November 1980, the Beaux Arts Society, Inc. (founded in 1857) designated Paul Lynde "King" of the Beaux Arts Ball. Kitty Carlisle was designated "Queen" that year. Paul Lynde remained a Life Member of the Beaux Arts Society from 1980 until his untimely death.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.beauxartssociety.org/royal-family-.html title=Royal Family website=Thomas Robert Stevens accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref>

==Death==
On January 11, 1982, after Lynde had failed to attend a birthday celebration, his friend Paul Barresi became concerned. When he and another friend, actor Dean Ditman, could not get an answer on the phone or from knocking on his door, Barresi broke into the side entrance to Lyndes home in Beverly Hills, California and found him dead in his bed. He was 55 years old. Stories suggesting Lynde had a visitor at the time of his death who fled the scene circulated but could not be proven,<ref name="biog"/> as the comedian regularly activated his house alarm before retiring for the evening. When Barresi broke in, the alarm blared, implying Lynde was alone at the time of his death and that he had died in his sleep.<ref name=death>{{cite news   author = Paul Simon   title = Paul Lynde Suffers Heart Attack: Dead at 55   url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xBJGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KNEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6913,912817&dq=paul+lynde+heart+attack&hl=en  work= Glasgow Daily Times The Daily Times   date= 12 January 1982   accessdate=2013-07-29}}</ref><ref name="rush-bio">{{cite news   author = Rush & Molloy   title = Lynde Bio Squarely Denies He ODd  url = http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/lynde-bio-squarely-denies-od-article-1.644941   work = New York Daily News   date = 1 September 2005   accessdate = 2013-07-29}}</ref> The coroner ruled the death a myocardial infarction heart attack.<ref name=death/> Lyndes cremated remains are interred at Amity Cemetery, in Amity, Knox County, Ohio, next to those of his brother Johnny and sister Helen.

==Legacy==
Lyndes popularity and high regard from the public have been maintained since his death. A biography was published in 2005, titled Center Square: The Paul Lynde Story. Authors Steve Wilson and Joe Florenski described Lynde as "Liberace without a piano" and that to most 1970s-era viewers, he was "a frustrated bit player and character actor on a daytime game show". To the homosexual community, his reputation was less than stellar: "In some ways, he came to symbolize whats perceived to be a self-loathing era for gay culture."<ref name=salon/>

Lyndes distinctive vocal delivery has also been widely imitated:
*The character of Wilford Wolf in the animated series The Kwicky Koala Show is voiced by John Stephenson (actor) John Stephenson as an impersonation of Lynde.
*Cartoon creator/voice actor Seth MacFarlane has acknowledged that the voice of Roger (American Dad!) Roger the Alien on American Dad! was modeled after Lynde.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RycYlI3-7DU title=American Dad! - Seth on Paul Lynde and Patrick Stewart first= last=The Paley Center for Media date=5 October 2012 publisher= accessdate=14 June 2017 via=YouTube}}</ref>
*The voice and humor of Queer Duck character Bi-Polar Bear, voiced by Billy West, is performed in the style of Lynde, as is supervillain The Scoutmaster in the Simpsons episode "Radioactive Man (The Simpsons episode) Radioactive Man".
*Steve Carell reprised Lyndes role as "Uncle Arthur" in the 2005 film Bewitched (2005 film) Bewitched, very much in Lyndes style.
*The voice of Big Cheese (voiced by Dean Hagopian in the shows English dub) on Samurai Pizza Cats is a Lynde impression.
*The voice and humor of William A. Mummy on the Game Show Network GSN game show Late Night Liars is performed in the vein of Lynde as well.
*In the 1970s version of Match Game, regular panelist Richard Dawson often spoke in the voice and mannerisms of Lynde.
*Escargoons English voice in Kirby: Right Back At Ya! is performed by Ted Lewis doing a Lynde impression.
*In 2010, Lyndes likeness appeared in the center square in the Futurama episode "Lethal Inspection", and again in the episode "The Six Million Dollar Mon". Both performances were delivered by Billy West.

==Personal life==
Despite his campy and flamboyant television persona, Lyndes private life and sexual orientation were not directly acknowledged or discussed on television or in other media during his lifetime. According to an essay on the web site for FYI_(U.S._TV_network)#The_Biography_Channel The Biography Channel, in the 1970s, entertainment journalists did not investigate the private lives of performers who were best known as game show regulars.<ref name="biography.com">{{cite web url=http://www.biography.com/news/tv-stars-of-the-1970s title=TV Stars Who Ruled the 70s publisher= accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref> In 1976, a People (American magazine) People magazine article on Lynde included text about Stan Finesmith; the latter was described as Lyndes "suite mate" and "chauffeur-bodyguard."

At a fast food restaurant after the homecoming parade, he made racist remarks and gestures to African American NU professor James Pitts.
