His mother died when he was in his early teens. Not long after his mothers death Kaye and his friend Louis ran away to Florida. Kaye sang while Louis played the guitar and the pair eked out a living for a while. When Kaye returned to New York, his father did not pressure him to return to school or work, giving his son the chance to mature and discover his own abilities.<ref name=Life/> Kaye said that as a young boy he had wanted to be a surgeon but the family could not afford a medical school education.<ref name= Clowns/><ref name= Wife>{{cite news title=Mrs. Danny Kaye Proves a Genius last=Battelle first=Phyllis date=May 8, 1959 newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel accessdate=March 10, 2011}}</ref>

He held a succession of jobs after leaving school: as a soda jerk, insurance investigator and office clerk. Most ended with his being fired. He lost the insurance job when he made an error that cost the insurance company $40,000. The dentist who hired him to look after his office at lunch hour did the same when he found Kaye using his Dental drill drill on the office woodwork. Years later Kaye married the dentists daughter, Sylvia Fine Sylvia. <ref name=Clowns/><ref name=Time>{{cite news url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,776720-1,00.html title=Git Gat Gittle date=March 11, 1946 work=Time (magazine) Time accessdate=January 14, 2011}}</ref> He learned his trade in his teenage years in the Catskill Mountains Catskills as a tummler in the Borscht Belt.<ref name="Bio"/>

Kayes first break came in 1933 when he joined the "Three wikt:terpsichorean Terpsichoreans", a vaudeville dance act. They opened in Utica, New York, where he used the name Danny Kaye for the first time.<ref name="Bio"/> The act toured the United States, then performed in Asia with the show La Vie Paree.<ref name=Dena/> 

The troupe left for a six-month tour of the Far East on February 8, 1934. While they were in Osaka, Japan, a typhoon hit the city. The hotel where Kaye and his colleagues stayed suffered heavy damage. The strong wind hurled a piece of the hotels cornice into Kayes room; had he been hit, he might well have been killed. By performance time that evening the city was in the grip of the storm. There was no power and the audience was restless and nervous. To calm them Kaye went on stage holding a flashlight to illuminate his face and sang every song he could recall as loudly as he was able.<ref name=Clowns/> 

The experience of trying to entertain audiences who did not speak English inspired him to the pantomime, gestures, songs and facial expressions that eventually made his reputation.<ref name="Bio"/><ref name=Time/> Sometimes he found pantomime necessary when ordering a meal. Kayes daughter, Dena, tells a story her father related about being in a restaurant in China and trying to order chicken. Kaye flapped his arms and clucked, giving the waiter an imitation of a chicken. The waiter nodded in understanding, bringing Kaye two eggs. His interest in cooking began on the tour.<ref name="Bio"/><ref name=Dena>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OwBKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LB4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2332,3334403&dq=danny+kaye&hl=en title=Life With My Zany Father-Danny Kaye last=Kaye first=Dena date=January 19, 1969 newspaper=Tri City Herald accessdate=January 15, 2011}}</ref>

Jobs were in short supply when Kaye returned to the United States and he struggled for bookings. One job was working in a burlesque revue with fan dancer Sally Rand. After the dancer dropped a fan while trying to chase away a fly, Kaye was hired to watch the fans so they were always held in front of her.<ref name="Bio"/><ref name=Time/>

==Career==
Danny Kaye made his film debut in a 1935 comedy short Moon Over Manhattan. In 1937 he signed with New York–based Educational Pictures for a series of two-reel comedies. He usually played a manic, dark-haired, fast-talking Russian in these low-budget shorts, opposite young hopefuls June Allyson and Imogene Coca. The Kaye series ended abruptly when the studio shut down in 1938. He was working in the Catskills in 1937 under the name Danny Kolbin.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/bobhope/images/vc53ap1.jpg title="Highlights and Shadows"-front of program date=July 4, 1937 publisher=The President Players accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/bobhope/images/vc53ap2.jpg title="Highlights and Shadows" – inside of program date=July 4, 1937 publisher=The President Players accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref>

His next venture was a short-lived Broadway show with Sylvia Fine as the pianist, lyricist and composer.

Kaye scored a triumph at age 30 in 1941 playing Russell Paxton in Lady in the Dark starring Gertrude Lawrence. His show-stopping number was "Tchaikovsky (song) Tchaikovsky" by Kurt Weill and Ira Gershwin in which he sang the names of a string of Russian composers at breakneck speed, seemingly without taking a breath.<ref name="Star"/><ref name= King>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rkIqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_E4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3849,3453774&dq=sylvia+fine+dena&hl=en title=Danny Kaye: King of Comedy last=Remington first=Fred date=January 12, 1964 work=The Pittsburgh Press accessdate=March 10, 2011}}</ref> In the next Broadway season he was the star of a show about a young man who is drafted called Lets Face It!.<ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X7EtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ppgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4949,1337710&dq=eve+arden+danny+kaye&hl=en title=Danny Kaye as Musical Draftee Brightens the Broadway Scene last=Edel first=Leon date=November 8, 1941 accessdate=January 19, 2011}}</ref>

Kaye had one character he never shared with the public; Kaplan, the owner of an Akron, Ohio rubber company, came to life only for family and friends. His wife Sylvia described the Kaplan character:<ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4T01AAAAIBAJ&sjid=FGUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7384,576802&dq=sylvia+fine&hl=en title=It Happened Last Night last=Wilson first=Earl date=July 4, 1959 work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune accessdate=January 18, 2011}}</ref><blockquote>He doesnt have any first name.

If Danny feels like doing Kaplan that night he might be off on Kaplan for two hours.</blockquote>

When he appeared at the London Palladium in 1948 he "roused the Royal family to laughter and was the first of many performers who have turned British variety into an American preserve."

===Career in music===
Kaye was enamored of music. While he claimed an inability to read music, he was said to have perfect pitch. A flamboyant performer with his own distinctive style, "easily adapting from outrageous novelty songs to tender ballads" (according to critic Jason Ankeny), in 1945 Kaye began hosting his own CBS radio program, launching a number of hit songs including "Dinah" and "Minnie the Moocher".<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web author=Jason Ankeny url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/danny-kaye-mn0000029750/biography title=Danny Kaye biography at publisher=Allmusic accessdate=2015-01-13}}</ref>

In 1947 Kaye teamed with the popular Andrews Sisters (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne) on Decca Records, producing the number-three Billboard hit "Civilization (Bongo, Bongo, Bongo)". The success of the pairing prompted both acts to record through 1950, producing rhythmically comical fare as "Woody Woodpecker#"The Woody Woodpecker Song" The Woody Woodpecker Song" (based on the bird from the Walter Lantz cartoons and a Billboard hit for the quartet), "Put em in a Box, Tie em with a Ribbon (And Throw em in the Deep Blue Sea)", "The Big Brass Band from Brazil", "Its a Quiet Town (In Crossbone County)", "Amelia Cordelia McHugh (Mc Who?)", "Ching-a-ra-sa-sa" and a duet by Danny and Patty Andrews of "Orange Colored Sky".

The album was reissued as a Columbia LP in 1949 and is described by the critic Bruce Eder as "a bit tamer than some of the stuff that Kaye hit with later in the 40s and in the 50s and, for reasons best understood by the public, doesnt attract nearly the interest of his kids records and overt comedy routines."<ref name="allmusic_1949">{{cite web author=Bruce Eder url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/danny-kaye-mw0001447249 title=Danny Kaye 1949 album review publisher=Allmusic accessdate=2015-01-13}}</ref>

===Imitations===
Kaye was sufficiently popular to inspire imitations:
* The 1946 Warner Bros. cartoon Book Revue had a sequence with Daffy Duck wearing a blond wig and impersonating Kaye.<ref>{{cite book last=Barrier first=Michael url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDJXnzMh7bkC&pg=PA463&lpg=463 title=Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age year=2003 page=463 orig-year=1999 publisher=Oxford University Press via=Google Books isbn=978-0-1951-6729-0 accessdate=September 13, 2016}}</ref>
* Satirical songwriter Tom Lehrers 1953 song "Lobachevsky (song) Lobachevsky" was based on a number that Kaye had done, about the Russian director Constantin Stanislavski, with the affected Russian accent. Lehrer mentioned Kaye in an opening monologue, citing him as an "idol since childbirth".<ref>{{cite web   last=Lehrer   first=Tom   title=Lobachevsky Lyrics   work=Metrolyrics   url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/lobachevsky-lyrics-tom-lehrer.html   access-date=March 17, 2018}}</ref>

While filming The Madwoman of Chaillot in France, he phoned home to ask his family if they would like to eat at Yings Thing that evening; Kaye flew home for dinner.<ref name=Dena/> Not all of his efforts in the kitchen went well. After flying to San Francisco for a recipe for sourdough bread, he came home and spent hours preparing loaves.

Working alongside UNICEFs Halloween fundraiser founder, Ward Simon Kimball Jr., the actor educated the public on impoverished children in deplorable living conditions overseas and assisted in the distribution of donated goods and funds. His involvement with UNICEF came about in an unusual way. Kaye was flying home from London in 1949 when one of the planes four engines lost its propeller and caught fire. The problem was initially thought serious enough that it might make an ocean landing; life jackets and liferafts were made ready.{{cn date=June 2017}}

The plane was able to head back over 500 miles to land at Shannon Airport, Republic of Ireland Ireland. On the way back to Shannon, the head of the Childrens Fund, Maurice Pate, had the seat next to Danny Kaye and spoke at length about the need for recognition for the fund. Their discussion continued on the flight from Shannon to New York; it was the beginning of the actors long association with UNICEF.<ref name="UNICEF 2">{{Cite web url=http://www.unicefusa.org/partners/ambassadors/danny-kaye/danny-kaye-bio.html title=Danny Kaye Biography accessdate=March 23, 2014 publisher=UNICEF}}</ref><ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jUIjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=O2gFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2884,742737&dq=danny+kaye&hl=en title=Crippled Transport Limps to Safety date=July 8, 1949 newspaper=The Lewiston Daily Sun  location=Lewiston, Maine  accessdate=January 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.unicef.org/people/people_danny_kaye.html title=Danny Kaye publisher=UNICEF accessdate=January 19, 2011}}</ref>

"For all of his success as a performer...his greatest legacy remains his tireless humanitarian work—so close were his ties to the United Nations International Childrens Emergency Fund (UNICEF) that when the organization received the Nobel Peace Prize, Kaye was tapped to accept it", according to music critic Jason Ankeny.<ref name="allmusic"/>
