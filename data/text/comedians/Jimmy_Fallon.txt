He had spurned most major roles due to lack of time and disinterest in the dozens of scripts he read.<ref name="usa04"/> He signed on for his first lead role in Taxi (2004 film) Taxi, a remake of a French film. Fallon had read the script in the prior years but became more interested when co-star Queen Latifah became attached to the project.

Film offers decreased, with his two chances for major films both considered failures.

Prior to leaving SNL, Michaels had mentioned to Fallon that he would be a good fit to take over NBCs Late Night (NBC) Late Night franchise when then-host Conan OBrien would depart the show to host the long-running Tonight Show in the future.

Fallon was considered an odd choice for the job, both by executives at NBC (who "hated" the idea and predicted it to be a failure), and among the general public.

Late Night with Jimmy Fallon premiered in March 2009 to mixed reviews. Producer Michael Shoemaker felt that the shows style solidified when it used Susan Boyle as a joke. While other late-night programs had centered on her appearance, Fallons Late Night debuted a sketch in which Boyles emotional performances could "salve any affliction."<ref name="NYM"/> It was this style of humor, that Adam Sternbergh of New York (magazine) New York dubbed "the comedy of unabashed celebration", that led to the programs success.<ref name="NYM"/>

Fallon proved himself different from other late-night hosts, with more of a reliance on music, dancing, impersonations, and games.<ref name=rs>{{cite journal  author=Brian Hiatt  date =January 20, 2011  title =Jimmy Fallons Big Adventure journal=Rolling Stone (magazine) Rolling Stone  issue=1122 publisher=Jann Wenner Wenner Media Limited liability company LLC location=New York City issn=0035-791X url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jimmy-fallons-big-adventure-20110120 accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref>

Between Fallons own musical sensibilities and the recruitment of his house band, hip-hop collective The Roots, his incarnation of Late Night "evolved into the most deeply musical of TVs musical-comedy variety programs", with sketches in which he parodies Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen going viral online. Coincidentally, it was during the 2010 Tonight Show conflict Tonight Show debacle that Fallons show found its footing.<ref name="VF"/>
