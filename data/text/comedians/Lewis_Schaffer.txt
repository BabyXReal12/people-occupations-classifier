Schaffers show "Free until Famous" at the Source Below in Soho ran from October 2008 until April 2014, and afterwards at The Rancho Grill in Mayfair, London. His show was the "longest running solo stand-up show in London and perhaps all of Britain", running in excess of 400 performances.
He visited 47 British art centres and theatres in 2015 with a pay-what-you-want touring show.
In December 2015, he performed a run of 12 dates at the Museum of Comedy under the show title "Lewis Schaffer: Free until Famous, £10".

=="Lewis Schaffer: American in London"==
Lewis Schaffer performed his show "Lewis Schaffer: American in London" every Sunday at the Leicester Square Theatre in London for over three years until June 2014, making it the longest solo comedy residency at the theatre.{{citation-needed date=September 2017}} 

==Edinburgh Fringe Stunt==
In 2009, he announced as a publicity stunt that he would be sponsoring the Edinburgh Comedy Awards at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
He claimed he had purchased the naming rights to the awards for "£99 with his mother as a judge". This was reported as fact in various publications
and led to threat of a lawsuit from the awards rights holder
and being fired by his theatrical agents.

Lewis Schaffer has hosted Nunhead American Radio with Lewis Schaffer on Resonance 104.4FM London since 2009. It is the only radio program for Americans living in Nunhead and is broadcast live every Monday at 6:30PM GMT. Guests have included comedians Russell Howard, Richard Herring, and Stewart Lee.

==Awards==

and, in 2010, he was nominated for the Malcolm Hardee Award for Comic Originality.
In 2017, he won the The Wee Review Wee Review Fringe Experience Award for his Fringe show, Unopened Letters From My Mother, in which he opened and read a series of letters sent to him by his late mother after he moved to London.
