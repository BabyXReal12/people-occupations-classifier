==Career==

===Stand-up career===
Inspired by his parents work in comedy and show business, a 17-year-old Shore made his stand-up debut at the Alley Cat Bistro in Culver City. "Everyone else in school was filling out their SAT applications, but I just passed mine back. I knew I wasnt going to go to college."<ref>{{cite journal   first = G.   last = Beato   title = Behind the Weasic   date = October 1999   journal = Spin (magazine) Spin  volume=15  issue=10 page=118   accessdate = 2011-01-14  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygXnnzAlaNQC&pg=PA118#v=onepage&f=false}} (Google books).</ref> Shore was mentored by Sam Kinison and opened several of his sets. While touring the comedy club circuit, Shore cultivated an alter ego persona, "The Weasel".

"The Weasel" involved Shore speaking in a Valspeak surfer parlance, heavily peppered with dudespeak slang such as "edged", "melons" and "grinding" as well as his catchphrase, "Hey, BU-DDY."<ref name=hey-dude>{{cite news   first = Jim   last = Sullivan   title = Hey dude, the Weasel is, like, the future of America   date = June 24, 1991   agency = (Boston Globe)   newspaper=Spokane Chronicle  page=B5   accessdate = 2011-01-14  url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WhlXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=E_oDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6946,3010075&dq=hey+dude+the+weasel+is+like+the+future+of+america&hl=en}} (Google news archive)</ref>

===MTV===
Shores big break came as an on-air MTV VJ, a position he held from 1989 to 1994. At the height of his MTV fame, Shore had his own show, Totally Pauly, serving as a host, most memorably on MTVs annual Spring Break parties. He also released a music video, "Lisa, Lisa, the One I Adore".<ref name=hey-dude />

===Film career===
In 1992, Shore starred in Encino Man, which was a modest hit. The films success propelled Shore to star in additional personalized vehicles, albeit increasingly less successful: Son in Law (1993), In the Army Now (film) In the Army Now (1994), Jury Duty (film) Jury Duty (1995), and Bio-Dome (1996). All five films received sharply negative reviews, with the last three each holding a rating below 10% at Rotten Tomatoes; in addition, each of the movies grossed less at the box office than the one before. In 1997, Shore starred in the eponymous TV show Pauly; the show was cancelled after five episodes aired. Shore makes a cameo appearance in the American rock music rock band Limp Bizkit music video "N 2 Gether Now",<ref>{{cite book last=Devenish first= Colin  year=2000 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NklshARL7PMC&pg=PA148#v=onepage&f=false  title=Limp Bizkit publisher=St. Martins Griffin page= 148 isbn=978-0-312-26349-2}} {Google books}.</ref><ref>{{cite AV media  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMLetx7SjCw  title=N 2 Gether Now  format=Flash video  publisher=Limp Bizkit  VEVO official YouTube channel}}<!-- licensed content--></ref> as a pizza deliveryman, and a briefer appearance in "Break Stuff".<ref>{{cite AV media  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpUYjpKg9KY  title=Break Stuff  format=Flash video  publisher= Limp Bizkit VEVO official YouTube channel}}<!-- licensed content--></ref>
