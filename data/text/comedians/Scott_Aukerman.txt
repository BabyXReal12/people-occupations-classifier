==Early life==

In a 2015 interview, Aukerman said "Im still doing that same show, just with celebrities instead of my high school cafeteria."<ref>{{cite web last1=Sankin first1=Aaron title=How Scott Aukerman built an empire of absurdist comedy url=http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/13560/scott-aukerman-comedy-bang-bang-interview/?tw=kr#sthash.wKy30Z2T.dpuf date=July 5, 2015}}</ref> He started a short-lived band, The Naked Postmen, with Adrian Young, who went on to be the drummer for No Doubt.<ref name="ReferenceA">Never Not Funny podcast - Episode 4.11</ref> 

While attending Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, he and fellow student B. J. Porter began writing together when they were both scripting and performing in a radio show called Lutz Radio.<ref name="BA"/>

==Career==
After a brief period studying at the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts and touring the country as a musical theater actor, in 1995, at the request of his friends, Aukerman and Porter started performing at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles under the moniker "The Fun Bunch", a name meant to parody improvisation groups at the time.<ref name="BA"/>

Mr. Show with Bob and David Mr. Show co-creator Bob Odenkirk was in the audience for the second performance, and soon tapped the duo to write for and occasionally perform on the show in its fourth season. This led to an Emmy nomination in 1999 for Aukerman and the rest of the staff. Aukerman appeared sporadically on the show, most notably as the model Theo Brixton in the Taint Magazine sketch.

After the shows cancellation, Aukerman and Porter segued into writing film and television scripts, most notably Run Ronnie Run! and the first draft of the film Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. In 2004, he and Porter received an "Additional Dialogue" credit on the animated feature film Shark Tale. They went on to write an unproduced script for the sequel, as well as an unproduced Shrek spin-off film based on the character Puss in Boots (Shrek) Puss in Boots. In 2007, a feature film script he wrote with Porter and Odenkirk, titled Kanan Rhodes: Unkillable Servant of Justice, was purchased by MTV Films with the intent of starring Rainn Wilson, although it currently remains unproduced.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/rainn-wilson-kanan-rhodes/  title=Rainn Wilson IS Kanan Rhodes  date=January 5, 2007  accessdate=January 5, 2007 work=Empire }}</ref> Also in 2007, Aukerman released a self-described "joke record", Scott Aukermans Koo Koo Roos Greatest Hits, which featured Aukerman and Sarah Silverman Program writer Jon Schroeder shouting over current soft-rock hits. This was put out in limited release on AST Records.

In 2009, Aukerman and Porter wrote a pilot script for NBC, titled Privates. The network ultimately passed on the show.<ref>{{cite news  url=https://variety.com/2009/scene/markets-festivals/writers-pact-with-universal-tv-1118001444/ title=Writers pact with Universal TV  accessdate=March 19, 2009  work= Variety   first=Michael   last=Schneider   date=March 19, 2009}}</ref> That year, Aukerman took on the role as head writer for the 2009 MTV Movie Awards and executive produced and co-wrote a pilot for Comedy Central, The New Andy Dick Show. The network ultimately passed on ordering it to series.

In 2010, Aukerman wrote a feature film script for friend Zach Galifianakis for Fox, and he and Patton Oswalt co-wrote a television pilot for Fox, which the network ultimately passed on. Later that year, Aukerman joined a "writers lab", writing film scripts for Imagine Entertainment.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://deadline.com/2010/12/imagine-and-reliance-big-launch-writers-lab-90427/ title=Imagine And Reliance Launch Writers Lab last=Fleming first=Mike accessdate=December 13, 2011 work= Deadline   date=December 13, 2010}}</ref>

===Comedy Death-Ray/Comedy Bang! Bang!===
In 2002, Aukerman and Porter started the successful alternative comedy showcase Comedy Death-Ray, which ran Tuesday night at the M Bar in Los Angeles.<ref>{{Cite news url=https://www.mensjournal.com/travel/the-future-of-talk-with-scott-aukerman-20140605/ title=Discussing the Future Of Talk With Scott Aukerman date=2014-06-05 work=Mens Journal access-date=2018-03-22 language=en-US}}</ref> Porter had friends in common with M Bar owner Joe Reynolds, and visited the bar shortly after its opening. Upon seeing how empty M Bar was, Porter convinced Reynolds to let him start a comedy show to help business. The show eventually moved to the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in 2005 to gain more creative freedom.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.funbunchcomedy.com/weblog/archives/2005/07/the_ast_intervi_2.html  title=Fun Bunch Interview with ASpecialThing.com  accessdate=March 18, 2007  work= }}</ref>  A Comedy Death-Ray CD taped partially in San Francisco at the SF Sketchfest and partially at their fourth-anniversary, all-night show in LA was released on Comedy Central Records on September 11, 2007. The CD featured Aukerman, comedians David Cross, Patton Oswalt, Paul F. Tompkins, and other CDR regulars.

In 2007, Aukerman and Porter produced several internet shorts with Comedy Death-Ray comedians for the internet site Super Deluxe. These included three episodes of The Brody Stevens Interview Challenge, and two episodes of Lake Charles Lake, in which he also co-starred. They made more shorts in 2008, but the site was shut down and folded into Adult Swim before they could air.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://newteevee.com/2008/05/08/superdeluxe-to-sink-into-adult-swim/  title=Super Deluxe Sinks Into Adult Swim  accessdate=May 8, 2008  work= }}</ref>

In 2007, Aukerman and B. J. Porter created and produced a sketch pilot, titled The Right Now! Show, based on their show for Fox Broadcasting Company Fox.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.dead-frog.com/blog/entry/interview_scott_aukerman_and_bj_porter_comedy_death_ray/  title=Dead Frog Interview: Scott Aukerman & BJ Porter  accessdate=September 12, 2007  work= }}</ref>  However, the network passed on ordering it to series in late 2007. Cast member Casey Wilson was immediately hired as a featured cast member of Saturday Night Live after the news. A short film made for the show, Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis, eventually moved to internet site Funny Or Die, becoming one of its most successful series.

Starting January 3, 2011, Aukerman became the host of a series of interview interstitials, titled Comedy Death-Ray, airing three nights a week on the Independent Film Channel IFC network, where he interviews stars and creators of shows that the network runs, including The Ben Stiller Show, The Larry Sanders Show, Mr. Show with Bob and David Mr. Show, Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared, and Arrested Development (TV series) Arrested Development.

In 2011, Aukerman and Porter parted ways, and Comedy Death-Ray was renamed Comedy Bang! Bang!
