===Content creator===
In November 2007, Helbig house sitting house-sat for a family in South Orange, New Jersey. To alleviate boredom and keep herself entertained, she began a daily vlog of her house sitting experience on her personal YouTube channel GracieHinABox. Beginning March 2008, Helbig and her college roommate Michelle Akin (née Vargas) created the Grace n Michelle YouTube channel. The most recent video on this channel was uploaded on October 25, 2013, when Helbig visited Akin in Brooklyn.

In early 2008, Helbig narrated the short-lived animated web series, Bedtime Stories on My Damn Channel, which consisted of R-rated parodies of classic fairy tales.
My Damn Channel founder and CEO Rob Barnett discovered her personal vlogs through her profile and offered her the opportunity to host her own video blog web series on the My Damn Channel website.
This became DailyGrace, which premiered on April 14, 2008, with new episodes published every weekday.
On October 11, 2010, DailyGrace was launched as its own YouTube channel. By the end of December 2013, the channel had amassed over 2.4 million subscribers and over 211 million video views on YouTube.
From the series inception in April 2008 through December 2013, Helbig created over 830 DailyGrace episodes for the DailyGrace YouTube channel—in addition to the 690 DailyGrace episodes that had been published exclusively on the My Damn Channel website (i.e., all episodes up to October 8, 2010 as well as additional extra videos after that date).
From March 2012 through January 2013, Helbig hosted My Damn Channel LIVE once a week from the companys New York City studio (the remaining weekday episodes were hosted by Beth Hoyt).  In November 2013, the series was revived in a weekly format as My Damn Channel LIVE: Hangout, with Helbig making a few appearances via Videophone video chat from the Los Angeles studio.

On September 13, 2013, Helbig premiered her weekly web series Graces Faces on beauty guru Bobbi Browns newly created YouTube channel I love makeup.
The series lasted twenty-four episodes and ended March 7, 2014.

On November 4, 2013, Helbig premiered a weekly supplemental DailyGrace series exclusive to the My Damn Channel website entitled One Thing You Didnt Know About Me From Last Week.
The series lasted five episodes and ended December 2, 2013.

On December 27, 2013, Helbig uploaded her final DailyGrace episode to the DailyGrace YouTube channel. Four days later, My Damn Channel released a statement announcing that Helbig had chosen not to renew her multi-year contract with the network, and that going forward, no new content would be created by Helbig for the DailyGrace YouTube channel. My Damn Channel indicated that the DailyGrace YouTube channel would remain active solely as an archive, with plans for the network to upload the early DailyGrace episodes and other Helbig content that had formerly been exclusive to the My Damn Channel website.
On January 6, 2014, Helbig relaunched her personally owned, formerly secondary channel itsGrace (renamed from GracieHinABox) as her main YouTube channel.
News of Helbigs departure from My Damn Channel and the shift back to her own independent channel contributed to a dramatic increase in itsGrace subscribers, from just under 87,000 in the last week of 2013 to over a half million by the first week of 2014. On January 22, 2014, just two and a half weeks after the channels relaunch, itsGrace passed 1 million subscribers.
On April 30, 2014, it was announced via press release that Helbig had partnered with multi-channel network Fullscreen (company) Fullscreen.

On March 31, 2016, in conjunction with AT&amp;T Hello Lab, Helbig premiered a new series Writing With Grace on her YouTube channel, in which she instructed viewers to collaborate with her via Wattpad to co-write a novella called "Freak Week". Helbig, along with other fellow YouTube personalities, held a live reading of the completed novella at VidCon on June 24, 2016.
On November 15, 2017, it was announced via press release that Helbig had left Fullscreen and partnered with multi-channel network Studio71.
Starting on March 5, 2018, Helbig and Mamrie Hart began hosting a new YouTube show together called This Might Get...
on a dedicated channel of the same name. Each episode has a different title, with the premiere being called "This Might Get Started," and focuses on a different topic, meme, or pop culture event.
It is executive produced by Michael Goldfine, who worked with the on-screen duo on Camp Takota and Dirty 30.
Hart and Helbig published their 100th episode of "This Might Get..." on July 20, 2018, entitled "Making Slime Fail!".
