==Early years==
Wall was born Maxwell George Lorimer, son of the successful music-hall entertainer Jack Lorimer Jack (Jock) Lorimer, a Scotland Scottish comedy actor from Forfar, known for his songs and dancing, and his wife Stella (born Maud Clara Mitchison). He was born near the Oval, at 37 Glenshaw Mansions, Brixton Road, London SW9. In 1916, during a World War I air raid, Max and his elder brother Alex were saved from death by a cast iron bed frame, but his younger brother Bunty and their Aunt Betty, who was looking after them, were killed by a bomb dropped from a Germany German Zeppelin which also destroyed their house.<ref name=maxwallsociety>{{cite web url=http://www.maxwallsociety.org/page3.html title=Maxs Life Page 1 publisher=}}</ref>

Max and Alex went to live with their father and his family, whilst their mother went to live with Harry Wallace, whom she had met on tour. When their father died of tuberculosis in 1920, aged 37, their mother married Harry Wallace, and they all moved to a pub in Essex.<ref>An Audience with Max Wall - BBC Radio 4 - first broadcast 3 December 2007</ref>

==Career==

===Early career===
Wall auditioned for a part with a touring theatre company, and made his stage début at the age of 14 as Jack in Mother Goose with a travelling pantomime company in Devon and Cornwall featuring Pantomime dame George Lacey. In 1925 he was a speciality dancer in the London Revue at the Lyceum Theatre, London Lyceum.  He became determined not to rely on his fathers name, so abbreviated Maxwell to Max, and his stepfathers name Wallace, to Wall.<ref name=voices>{{cite web url=http://voices-of-variety.com/max-wall/  title=Max Wall  publisher=Voices of Variety  date=  accessdate=27 May 2014}}</ref>

He is best remembered for his ludicrously attired and hilariously strutting Professor Wallofski. John Cleese has acknowledged Walls influence on his own "Ministry of Silly Walks" sketch for Monty Pythons Flying Circus.<ref>{{cite web url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-23/news/mn-33_1_max-wall title=Max Wall; British Dancer-Comedian Gained Fame in Beckett Plays first1=From last1=Staff first2=Wire last2=Reports date=23 May 1990 publisher= via=LA Times}}</ref> After appearing in many Musical theatre musicals and stage comedies in the 1930s, Walls career went into decline, and he was reduced to working in obscure nightclubs. He then joined the Royal Air Force during World War II and served for three years until he was invalided out in 1943.<ref name=voices/>

Wall married dancer Marion Pola and the couple had five children. In an interview with the family in the mid-1950s, Tit-Bits magazine wrote: "The kind of private jokes you find in all the nicest families flourish with the Walls. After Max and his wife, Marion, had their first son, Michael, it seemed kind of natural to make a corner in names beginning with ‘M’, and there are now Melvyn (aged nine), Martin (nearly five) and the four-month-old twins Meredith and Maxine. ... In the same way, because the Walls, like other couples married during the war, were eventually thrilled when they found a house with four walls of their own, they decided to call it just that, only Martin arrived and made it ‘Five Walls’."<ref name=voices/>

In 1955 Wall left Marion and became involved with Jennifer Chimes, that years Miss Great Britain, who was 26 years his junior and married with children. The couple married in 1956, but the following year Wall collapsed on stage and suffered a nervous breakdown. Jennifer left him, and although there were reconciliations, he divorced Jennifer for desertion in 1962.<ref name=voices/>

===Re-emergence===
Wall re-emerged during the 1950s when producers and directors rediscovered his comic talents, along with the expressive power of his tragic clown face and the distinctive sad falling cadences of his voice. He secured television appearances and, having attracted Samuel Becketts attention, he won parts in Waiting for Godot in 1979 and Krapps Last Tape in 1984.<ref name=page3>{{cite web url=http://www.maxwallsociety.org/page3c.html title=Maxs Life Page 4 publisher=}}</ref> In 1966 he appeared as Père Ubu in Alfred Jarry Jarrys Ubu Roi,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.npg.org.uk/support/individual/face-to-face/my-favourite-portrait/my-favourite-portrait-by-bill-paterson.php title=National Portrait Gallery - My Favourite Portrait by Bill Paterson publisher=}}</ref> and in 1972 he toured with Mott the Hoople on their "Rock n Roll Circus Tour", gaining a new audience.<ref>{{cite web url=http://mottthehoople.com/main/?page_id=103 title=MTH Timeline publisher=}}</ref> His straight acting gained him this review in 1974: "Max Wall makes Laurence Olivier Olivier look like an amateur in The Entertainer at Greenwich Theatre...".<ref>The Guardian, 27 November 1974</ref>
