At age eighteen, he saw a show by illusionist James Randi, and became enamored of his approach to magic that openly acknowledged deception as entertainment rather than a mysterious supernatural power. Jillette regularly acknowledges Randi as the one person on the planet he loves the most besides members of his family.<ref name="skepticalitynov2012">{{cite podcast  url = http://www.skepticality.com/jill-jet-and-the-magical-tale-of-penn/

==Career==
While the off-Broadway hit was running, in 1988 Jillette was in a speed mariachi power trio called Bongos, Bass and Bob. He played bass; bongos were by Dean J. Seal; and guitar was by Rob "Bob" Elk (Running Elk). The latter two became the a capella comedy duo Mr. Elk and Mr. Seal after the band broke up due to Jillettes movie commitments. They recorded an album with Kramer (musician) Kramer at Noise New York called Never Mind the Sex Pistols, Heres Bongos Bass and Bob (What on Earth Were They Thinking?). It was released to almost no notice outside of a mention in Spin (magazine) Spin Magazine, but was immortalized with a claymation video of the single, "Oral Hygiene".

Jillette was a contributor to the now-defunct PC/Computing magazine, having a regular back-section column between 1990 and 1994. He and the magazine parted ways over a dispute with a new editor James Martin in  {{date September 2014}}.{{citation needed date=September 2014}} Jillette felt the new editor was trying to tell him how to write his column and what topics he should be covering.

===Jill-Jet===
In July 1999, Jillette was granted {{US patent 5920923}} for the "Jill-Jet", a hot-tub jet specially angled for a womans pleasure. He has credited Debbie Harry of Blondie (band) Blondie for suggesting the idea, as the two of them were once in a hot tub and Harry made a remark about changing the jets for a womans pleasure. Jillette liked the idea enough to pursue a patent application at the USPTO under the patent title "Hydro-therapeutic Stimulator".<ref name="uspto">{{cite web  last = Jillette  first = Penn  date = July 13, 1999  url = http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=5920923.PN.&OS=PN/5920923&RS=PN/5920923  title = "Hydro-therapeutic Stimulator" (U.S. Patent 5,920,923)  work=USPTO Patent Full Text and Image Database  publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office
 accessdate = October 12, 2007}}</ref>

The abstract of the patent explains that a "discharge nozzle is located within the tub and connected to the outlet, mounted to the seat so that the discharged water from the circulation pump automatically aligns with and is directed to stimulation points (e.g., the clitoris) of the female user when the female user sits in the seat." An article in the June 2006 issue of Playboy shed additional light on the invention. Originally, it was to be called the "ClitJet"; however, he stated that "Jill-Jet" was more suitable because it included his name in the title.

On the Penn Radio show, telling the listeners about the photo shoot for the Playboy article, Jillette mentioned that he has a Jill-Jet installed in a tub in his house, and that several of his female friends and friends female spouses enjoy it a lot, but he is not aware of any other installations of a water jet in such a configuration anywhere else.

===Red fingernail===
Speculation arises from Jillettes red fingernail on his left hand. From the FAQ from Penn & Teller Penn & Tellers official website, there are three common answers:

# It means he once shot a man for asking personal questions.
# When Jillette first began performing, his mother told him to get a manicure because people would be looking at his hands. In response to this, he had all of his nails painted red as a joke. The one remaining red fingernail is in memory of his mother.<ref name="youtube.com">{{cite web author=pennsays  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxq9ORifmOs  title=Painting My Fingernail  publisher=YouTube  accessdate=April 14, 2012  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611211728/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxq9ORifmOs  archivedate=June 11, 2009 }}</ref>

In direct response to questions about his red fingernail, Penn has stated "People are asking about my fingernail. Wear my Dads ring and my Moms nail polish. Just for remembrance and respect."<ref>{{cite tweet  user= pennjillette author= Jillette, Penn   number= 328691791622709250  date= April 28, 2013  title= People are asking about my fingernail.
