Harold Clayton Lloyd Sr. (April 20, 1893&nbsp;– March 8, 1971) was an American actor, comedian, director, producer, screenwriter, and stunt performer who is best known for his Silent film silent comedy films.<ref name="WVobit">Obituary Variety Obituaries Variety, March 10, 1971, page 55.</ref>

Lloyd ranks alongside Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton as one of the most popular and influential film comedians of the silent film era. Lloyd made nearly 200 comedy films, both silent and "Sound film talkies", between 1914 and 1947. He is best known for his bespectacled
"Glasses" character,<ref>Austerlitz, Saul (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=R7nlzASASNsC&pg=PA28&dq= Another Fine Mess: A History of American Film Comedy].

a resourceful, success-seeking go-getter who was perfectly in tune with 1920s-era United States.

His films frequently contained "thrill sequences" of extended chase scenes and daredevil physical feats, for which he is best remembered today. Lloyd hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street (in reality a trick shot) in Safety Last! (1923) is one of the most enduring images in all of cinema.<ref>{{cite book  last =Slide  first =Anthony  authorlink =Anthony Slide  title =Silent Players: A Biographical and Autobiographical Study of 100 Silent Film Actors and Actresses  publisher =Univ.

Although Lloyds individual films were not as commercially successful as Chaplins on average, he was far more prolific (releasing 12 feature films in the 1920s while Chaplin released just four), and made more money overall ($15.7 million to Chaplins $10.5 million).{{citation needed date=September 2017}}

==Early life==
Harold Clayton Lloyd was born on April 20, 1893 in Burchard, Nebraska, the son of James Darsie Lloyd and Sarah Elisabeth Fraser. His paternal great-grandparents were Welsh people Welsh.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.alphadragondesign.com/final_project/pages/others/harold.html title=Comedy in the 1920s - 1950s work=alphadragondesign.com access-date=April 13, 2015 archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724133810/http://www.alphadragondesign.com/final_project/pages/others/harold.html archive-date=July 24, 2012 dead-url=yes df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 1910, after his father had several business ventures fail, Lloyds parents divorced and his father moved with his son to San Diego, California. Lloyd had acted in theater since a child, but in California he began acting in one-reel film comedies around 1912.

==Career==
===Silent shorts and features===
Lloyd worked with Thomas Edisons motion picture company, and his first role was a small part as a Yaqui Indian in the production of The Old Monks Tale. At the age of 20, Lloyd moved to Los Angeles, and took up roles in several Keystone comedies. He was also hired by Universal Studios as an extra and soon became friends with aspiring filmmaker Hal Roach.<ref>{{cite web url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.fil.041 title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains - Lloyd, Harold (1893-1971) work=unl.edu access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref> Lloyd began collaborating with Roach who had formed his own studio in 1913. Roach and Lloyd created "Lonesome Luke", similar to and playing off the success of Charlie Chaplin films.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.silentsaregolden.com/articles/halroacharticle.html  title=Hal Roach article  website=Silentsaregolden.com  date=  access-date=2016-07-21}}</ref>

Lloyd hired Bebe Daniels as a supporting actress in 1914; the two of them were involved romantically and were known as "The Boy" and "The Girl". In 1919, she left Lloyd to pursue her dramatic aspirations. Later that year, Lloyd replaced Daniels with Mildred Davis, whom he would later marry. Lloyd was tipped off by Hal Roach to watch Davis in a movie. Reportedly, the more Lloyd watched Davis the more he liked her. Lloyds first reaction in seeing her was that "she looked like a big French doll".<ref>{{cite book  last =Pawlak  first =Debra Ann  title =Bringing Up Oscar: The Story of the Men and Women Who Founded the Academy   publisher =Pegasus Books  date =January 15, 2011  location =New York  page =62  isbn =978-1605981376}}</ref>

By 1918, Lloyd and Roach had begun to develop his character beyond an imitation of his contemporaries. Harold Lloyd would move away from tragicomic personas, and portray an everyman with unwavering confidence and optimism. The persona Lloyd referred to as his "Glass" character<ref>{{cite web title=Harold Lloyd biography   url=http://haroldlloyd.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=115&Itemid=176 publisher=haroldlloyd.com access-date=November 12, 2013}}</ref> (often named "Harold" in the silent films) was a much more mature comedy character with greater potential for sympathy and emotional depth, and was easy for audiences of the time to identify with. The "Glass" character is said to have been created after Roach suggested that Harold was too handsome to do comedy without some sort of disguise. To create his new character Lloyd donned a pair of lensless horn-rimmed eyeglasses but wore normal clothing;<ref name="DAgostino"/> previously, he had worn a fake mustache and ill-fitting clothes as the Chaplinesque "Lonesome Luke". "When I adopted the glasses," he recalled in a 1962 interview with Harry Reasoner, "it more or less put me in a different category because I became a human being. He was a kid that you would meet next door, across the street, but at the same time I could still do all the crazy things that we did before, but you believed them. They were natural and the romance could be believable." Unlike most silent comedy personae, "Harold" was never typecast to a social class, but he was always striving for success and recognition. Within the first few years of the characters debut, he had portrayed social ranks ranging from a starving vagrant in From Hand to Mouth to a wealthy socialite in Captain Kidds Kids.

In August 1919, while posing for some promotional still photographs in the Los Angeles Witzel Photography Studio, he was seriously injured holding a prop bomb thought merely to be a smoke pot. It exploded and mangled his right hand, causing him to lose a thumb and forefinger.  The blast was severe enough that the cameraman and prop director nearby were also seriously injured. Lloyd was in the act of lighting a cigarette from the fuse of the bomb when it exploded, also badly burning his face and chest and injuring his eye.  Despite the proximity of the blast to his face, he retained his sight. As he recalled in 1930, "I thought I would surely be so disabled that I would never be able to work again. I didnt suppose that I would have one five-hundredth of what I have now. Still I thought, Life is worth while. Just to be alive. I still think so."<ref>{{cite journal  last=Hall  first=Gladys  date=October 1930  title=Discoveries About Myself  url=https://archive.org/stream/motionpicture1923040chic#page/n595/mode/2up  journal=Motion Picture Magazine  location=New York  publisher=Brewster Publications  access-date=October 23, 2015 }}</ref>

Beginning in 1921, Roach and Lloyd moved from shorts to feature-length comedies. These included the acclaimed Grandmas Boy (1922 film) Grandmas Boy, which (along with Chaplins The Kid (1921 film) The Kid) pioneered the combination of complex character development and film comedy, the highly popular Safety Last! (1923), which cemented Lloyds stardom (and is the oldest film on the American Film Institutes List of 100 Most Thrilling Movies), and Why Worry? (1923).

Lloyd and Roach parted ways in 1924, and Lloyd became the independent producer of his own films. These included his most accomplished mature features Girl Shy, The Freshman (1925 film) The Freshman (his highest-grossing silent feature), The Kid Brother, and Speedy (film) Speedy, his final silent film. Welcome Danger (1929) was originally a silent film but Lloyd decided late in the production to remake it with dialogue. All of these films were enormously successful and profitable, and Lloyd would eventually become the highest paid film performer of the 1920s.<ref name=time1/> They were also highly influential and still find many fans among modern audiences, a testament to the originality and film-making skill of Lloyd and his collaborators. From this success he became one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in early Hollywood.

===Talkies and transition===
In 1924, Lloyd formed his own independent film production company, the Harold Lloyd Film Corporation, with his films distributed by Pathé and later Paramount Pictures Paramount and Twentieth Century-Fox. Lloyd was a founding member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

File:Harold Lloyd in the Milky Way.jpg thumb Lloyd in the 1936 film The Milky Way (1936 film) The Milky Way
Released a few weeks before the start of the Great Depression, Welcome Danger was a huge financial success, with audiences eager to hear Lloyds voice on film. Lloyds rate of film releases, which had been one or two a year in the 1920s, slowed to about one every two years until 1938.

The films released during this period were: Feet First, with a similar scenario to Safety Last which found him clinging to a skyscraper at the climax; Movie Crazy with Constance Cummings; The Cats-Paw, which was a dark political comedy and a big departure for Lloyd; and The Milky Way (1936 film) The Milky Way, which was Lloyds only attempt at the fashionable genre of the screwball comedy film.

To this point the films had been produced by Lloyds company. However, his go-getting screen character was out of touch with Great Depression movie audiences of the 1930s. As the length of time between his film releases increased, his popularity declined, as did the fortunes of his production company. His final film of the decade, Professor Beware, was made by the Paramount staff, with Lloyd functioning only as actor and partial financier.

On March 23, 1937, Lloyd sold the land of his studio, Harold Lloyd Motion Picture Company, to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The location is now the site of the Los Angeles California Temple.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/cgi-bin/pages.cgi?los_angeles title=Los Angeles California Temple  access-date=June 8, 2008  quote=The land for the Los Angeles California Temple was purchased from Harold Lloyd Motion Picture Company on March 23, 1937.  publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints }}</ref>

Lloyd produced a few comedies for RKO Radio Pictures in the early 1940s but otherwise retired from the screen until 1947. He returned for an additional starring appearance in The Sin of Harold Diddlebock, an ill-fated homage to Lloyds career, directed by Preston Sturges and financed by Howard Hughes. This film had the inspired idea of following Harolds Jazz Age, optimistic character from The Freshman into the Great Depression years. Diddlebock opened with footage from The Freshman (for which Lloyd was paid a royalty of $50,000, matching his actors fee) and Lloyd was sufficiently youthful-looking to match the older scenes quite well. Lloyd and Sturges had different conceptions of the material and fought frequently during the shoot; Lloyd was particularly concerned that while Sturges had spent three to four months on the script of the first third of the film, "the last two thirds of it he wrote in a week or less". The finished film was released briefly in 1947, then shelved by producer Hughes. Hughes issued a recut version of the film in 1951 through RKO under the title Mad Wednesday. Such was Lloyds disdain that he sued Howard Hughes, the California Corporation and RKO for damages to his reputation "as an outstanding motion picture star and personality", eventually accepting a $30,000 settlement.

===Radio and retirement===
In October 1944, Lloyd emerged as the director and host of The Old Gold Comedy Theater, an NBC radio anthology series, after Preston Sturges, who had turned the job down, recommended him for it. The show presented half-hour radio adaptations of recently successful film comedies, beginning with Palm Beach Story with Claudette Colbert and Robert Young (actor) Robert Young.

File:Harold Lloyd Shriner 1946.JPG thumb Lloyd in 1946, when he was appointed to the Shriners publicity committee
Some saw The Old Gold Comedy Theater as being a lighter version of Lux Radio Theater, and it featured some of the best-known film and radio personalities of the day, including Fred Allen, June Allyson, Lucille Ball, Ralph Bellamy, Linda Darnell, Susan Hayward, Herbert Marshall, Dick Powell, Edward G. Robinson, Jane Wyman, and Alan Young. But the shows half-hour format—which meant the material might have been truncated too severely—and Lloyds sounding somewhat ill at ease on the air for much of the season (though he spent weeks training himself to speak on radio prior to the shows premiere, and seemed more relaxed toward the end of the series run) may have worked against it.

The Old Gold Comedy Theater ended in June 1945 with an adaptation of Tom, Dick and Harry (1941 film) Tom, Dick and Harry, featuring June Allyson and Reginald Gardiner and was not renewed for the following season. Many years later, acetate discs of 29 of the shows were discovered in Lloyds home, and they now circulate among old-time radio collectors.

Lloyd remained involved in a number of other interests, including civic and charity work. Inspired by having overcome his own serious injuries and burns, he was very active as a Freemason and Shriner with the Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children. He was a Past Potentate of Al-Malaikah Shrine in Los Angeles, and was eventually selected as Imperial Potentate of the Shriners of North America for the year 1949–50.<ref>[http://haroldlloyd.com/news/bio.asp "Harold LLoyd"] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122123330/http://haroldlloyd.com/news/bio.asp  date=January 22, 2009 }} "In 1949, Harolds face graced the cover of TIME Magazine as the Imperial Potentate of the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, their highest-ranking position. He devoted an entire year to visiting 130 temples across the country giving speeches for over 700,000 Shriners. The last twenty years of his life he worked tirelessly for the twenty-two Shriner Hospitals for Children and in the 1960s, he was named President and Chairman of the Board."</ref> At the installation ceremony for this position on July 25, 1949, 90,000 people were present at Soldier Field, including then sitting U.S. President Harry S Truman, also a 33° Scottish Rite Mason.<ref>{{cite web last=Lloyd first=Harold title=Phoenix Masonry Masonic Museum  url=http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmuseum/harold_lloyd_masonic_bio.htm  work=Masonic Research publisher=Phoenix Masonry  access-date=July 29, 2012}}</ref> In recognition of his services to the nation and Freemasonry, Bro. Lloyd was invested with the Rank and Decoration of Knight Commander Court of Honour in 1955 and coroneted an Inspector General Honorary, 33°, in 1965.

He appeared as himself on several television shows during his retirement, first on Ed Sullivans variety show Toast of the Town June 5, 1949, and again on July 6, 1958. He appeared as the Mystery Guest on Whats My Line? on April 26, 1953, and twice on This Is Your Life: on March 10, 1954 for Mack Sennett, and again on December 14, 1955, on his own episode. During both appearances, Lloyds hand injury can clearly be seen.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0516001/#self  title=Harold Lloyd  access-date=June 8, 2008  quote=  publisher=IMDB }}</ref>

Lloyd studied colors and microscopy, and was very involved with photography, including 3D photography and color film experiments. Some of the earliest 2-color Technicolor tests were shot at his Beverly Hills home (these are included as extra material in the Harold Lloyd Comedy Collection DVD Box Set). He became known for his nude photographs of models, such as Bettie Page and stripper Dixie Evans, for a number of mens magazines. He also took photos of Marilyn Monroe lounging at his pool in a bathing suit, which were published after her death. In 2004, his granddaughter Suzanne produced a book of selections from his photographs, Harold Lloyds Hollywood Nudes in 3D! ({{ISBN 1-57912-394-5}}).

Lloyd also provided encouragement and support for a number of younger actors, such as Debbie Reynolds, Robert Wagner, and particularly Jack Lemmon, whom Harold declared as his own choice to play him in a movie of his life and work.

===Renewed interest===

Lloyd kept copyright control of most of his films and re-released them infrequently after his retirement. Lloyd did not grant cinematic release because most theaters could not accommodate an organist, and Lloyd did not wish his work to be accompanied by a pianist: "I just dont like pictures played with pianos. We never intended them to be played with pianos." Similarly, his features were never shown on television as Lloyds price was high: "I want $300,000 per picture for two showings. Thats a high price, but if I dont get it, Im not going to show it. Theyve come close to it, but they havent come all the way up". As a consequence, his reputation and public recognition suffered in comparison with Chaplin and Keaton, whose work has generally been more available. Lloyds film character was so intimately associated with the 1920s era that attempts at revivals in 1940s and 1950s were poorly received, when audiences viewed the 1920s (and silent film in particular) as old-fashioned.

In the early 1960s, Lloyd produced two compilation films, featuring scenes from his old comedies, Harold Lloyds World of Comedy and The Funny Side of Life. The first film was premiered at the 1962 Cannes Film Festival, where Lloyd was fêted as a major rediscovery. The renewed interest in Lloyd helped restore his status among film historians. Throughout his later years he screened his films for audiences at special charity and educational events, to great acclaim, and found a particularly receptive audience among college audiences: "Their whole response was tremendous because they didnt miss a gag; anything that was even a little subtle, they got it right away."

Following his death, and after extensive negotiations, most of his feature films were leased to Time-Life Films in 1974. As Tom Dardis confirms: "Time-Life prepared horrendously edited musical-sound-track versions of the silent films, which are intended to be shown on TV at sound speed [24 frames per second], and which represent everything that Harold feared would happen to his best films".{{citation needed date=March 2016}} Time-Life released the films as half-hour television shows, with two clips per show. These were often near-complete versions of the early two-reelers, but also included extended sequences from features such as Safety Last! (terminating at the clock sequence) and Feet First (presented silent, but with Walter Scharfs score from Lloyds own 1960s re-release). Time-Life released several of the feature films more or less intact, also using some of Scharfs scores which had been commissioned by Lloyd. The Time-Life clips series included a narrator rather than intertitles. Various narrators were used internationally: the English-language series was narrated by Henry Corden.

The Time-Life series was frequently repeated by the BBC in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, and in 1990 a Thames Television documentary, Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius was produced by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, following two similar series based on Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.<ref>Documentary: Harold Lloyd — The Third Genius.</ref> Composer Carl Davis wrote a new score for Safety Last! which he performed live during a showing of the film with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra to great acclaim in 1993.<ref>https://issuu.com/fm_fortissimo/docs/faber_silents_catalogue_2016</ref>

The Brownlow and Gill documentary was shown as part of the PBS series American Masters, and created a renewed interest in Lloyds work in the United States, but the films were largely unavailable. In 2002, the Harold Lloyd Trust re-launched Harold Lloyd with the publication of the book Harold Lloyd: Master Comedian by Jeffrey Vance and Suzanne Lloyd<ref>{{cite news last=Loos  first=Ted  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/21/books/books-in-brief-nonfiction-a-matter-of-attitude.html  title=Books in Brief – Nonfiction – A Matter of Attitude  work=New York Times date=2002-07-21  access-date=2016-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/24/books/bk-turan24 title=Behind the Laughter work=latimes access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref> and a series of feature films and short subjects called "The Harold Lloyd Classic Comedies" produced by Jeffrey Vance and executive produced by Suzanne Lloyd for Harold Lloyd Entertainment. The new cable television and home video versions of Lloyds great silent features and many shorts were remastered with new orchestral scores by Robert Israel (composer) Robert Israel. These versions are frequently shown on the Turner Classic Movies (TCM) cable channel.  A DVD collection of these restored or remastered versions of his feature films and important short subjects was released by New Line Cinema in partnership with the Harold Lloyd Trust in  2005, along with theatrical screenings in the US, Canada, and Europe. Criterion Collection has subsequently acquired the home video rights to the Lloyd library, and have released Safety Last!,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.criterion.com/films/28446-safety-last title=Safety Last! work=The Criterion Collection access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref> The Freshman,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.criterion.com/films/28510-the-freshman title=The Freshman work=The Criterion Collection access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref> and Speedy (film) Speedy.<ref>{{Cite web url=https://www.criterion.com/films/28497-speedy title=Speedy website=The Criterion Collection access-date=2017-05-19}}</ref>

In the June 2006 Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra Silent Film Gala program book for Safety Last!, film historian Jeffrey Vance stated that Robert A. Golden, Lloyds assistant director, routinely doubled for Harold Lloyd between 1921 and 1927. According to Vance, Golden doubled Lloyd in the bit with Harold shimmy shaking off the buildings ledge after a mouse crawls up his trousers.<ref>{{cite web title="Safety Last!: Notes on the Making of the Film" : Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra Silent Film Gala program book, June 3, 2006 revised and reprinted as "Safety Last!"

Lloyd discouraged Davis from continuing her acting career. He later relented but by that time her career momentum was lost. Davis died from a heart attack in 1969, two years before Lloyds death. Though her real age was a guarded secret, a family spokesperson at the time indicated she was 66 years old. Harold Jr. died from complications of a stroke three months after his father.

In 1925, at the height of his movie career, Lloyd entered into Freemasonry at the Alexander Hamilton Lodge No. 535 of Hollywood, advancing quickly through both the York Rite and Scottish Rite, and then joined Al Malaikah Shrine in Los Angeles. He took the degrees of the Royal Arch Masonry Royal Arch with his father. In 1926, he became a 32° Scottish Rite Mason in the Valley of Los Angeles, California. He was vested with the Rank and Decoration of Knight Commander Court of Honor (KCCH) and eventually with the Inspector General Honorary, 33rd degree.

Lloyds Beverly Hills home, "Harold Lloyd Estate Greenacres", was built in 1926–1929, with 44 rooms, 26 bathrooms, 12 fountains, 12 gardens, and a nine-hole golf course. A portion of Lloyds personal inventory of his silent films (then estimated to be worth $2 million) was destroyed in August 1943 when his film vault caught fire. Seven firemen were overcome while inhaling chlorine gas from the blaze. Lloyd himself was saved by his wife, who dragged him to safety outdoors after he collapsed at the door of the film vault. The fire spared the main house and outbuildings. After attempting to maintain the home as a museum of film history, as Lloyd had wished, the Lloyd family sold it to a developer in 1975.

The grounds were subsequently subdivided but the main house and the estates principal gardens remain and are frequently used for civic fundraising events and as a filming location, appearing in films like Westworld (film) Westworld and The Loved One (film) The Loved One. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

My character represented the white-collar middle class that felt frustrated but was always fighting to overcome its shortcomings, he once explained. Lloyd usually did his own stunt work, as in Safety Last (1923), in which he dangled from a clock high above the street; he was protected only by a wooden platform two floors below.  work=Time (magazine) Time  date=March 22, 1971  access-date=June 8, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news title=Harold Lloyd, Bespectacled Film Comic, Dies of Cancer at 77  url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/601315582.html  quote=Comedian Harold Lloyd, 77, who bumbled through more than 300 films as a bespectacled victim of lifes difficulties, died of cancer Monday at his Beverly Hills home.  work=Los Angeles Times  date=March 9, 1971  access-date=June 8, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news first= Murray last= Illson title=Horn-Rims His Trademark; Harold Lloyd, Screen Comedian, Dies at 77  url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/09/archives/hornrims-his-trademark-harold-lloyd-screen-comedian-dies-at-77.html  quote=A pair of inexpensive, horn-rimmed eyeglass frames without lenses, the shy expression of a somewhat bewildered adolescent and a single-track ambition made Harold Clayton Lloyd the highest-paid screen actor in Hollywoods golden age of the nineteen twenties.  work=The New York Times  date=March 9, 1971  access-date=June 8, 2008 }}</ref> He was interred in a crypt in the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.<ref>{{Find a Grave 634}}</ref> His former co-star Bebe Daniels died eight days after him and his son Harold Lloyd Jr. died three months after him.{{citation needed date=June 2017}}

In 1953, Lloyd received an Academy Honorary Award for being a "master comedian and good citizen". The second citation was a snub to Chaplin, who at that point had fallen foul of McCarthyism and had his entry visa to the United States revoked. Regardless of the political overtones, Lloyd accepted the award in good spirit.

Lloyds birthplace in Burchard, Nebraska is maintained as a museum and open by appointment.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://pawneecountyhistory.com/lloyd/ title=Harold Lloyd Birthplace last= first= date= website= access-date=}}</ref>
