"how he outran police after a fan was, according to authorities, beaten on stage eight years ago."<ref>[http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/Jackass+star+Steve+recalls+running+from+Calgary+police/4522083/story.html ]{{Dead link date=May 2014}}</ref>

In May 2011, he brought his stand-up show to Australia, playing a show in all the major cities.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.barry.com.au/2011/04/21/steve-o-australian-tour/  title=Archived copy  accessdate=May 31, 2011  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511165006/http://www.barry.com.au/2011/04/21/steve-o-australian-tour/  archivedate=May 11, 2011  df=mdy-all }}</ref> In an interview with Comedy Digital Radio station Barry Steve-O explained the genesis of his comedy tour, "Someone invited me to a famous comedy club in Los Angeles and they asked that I get on stage and do something outrageous. When I got to that comedy club I looked around and it occurred to me that the craziest thing I could possibly do by far would be to try stand-up comedy. Like, that was genuinely the most terrifying, outlandish just crazy thing that I could do."<ref name="barry.com.au"/>

In June 2011, Steve-O released an autobiography entitled Professional Idiot: A Memoir, co-written with David Peisner. He has stated that he follows only a strict vegan diet and is one of the many celebrities that got involved in the NOH8 Campaign NOH8 project.

On September 13, 2011, during a taping of the Comedy Central Roast of Charlie Sheen, Steve-O joked, "The last time this many nobodies were at a roast, at least The Station nightclub fire Great White was playing".
