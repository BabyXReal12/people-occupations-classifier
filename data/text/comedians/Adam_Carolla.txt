While the format of the program was primarily a call-in show where listeners would ask questions about sex and relationships, Carolla would often spend much of the show ranting about various topics, from fart jokes to extended parodies of radio morning shows, including mocking the formats penchant for useless and repetitive weather and traffic reports. In contrast to the reserved, thoughtful Pinsky, Carolla served as the loud, funny side of the show. Carollas character was described by one reviewer as "a toned-down version of Howard Stern minus the huge ego".<ref name="UMNDaily"/> On September 25, 2001 Carolla and Jimmy Kimmel both had filled in for Howard Sterns head writer Jackie Martling after Martlings departure from the show in March 2001. Carolla had mentioned in various interviews and on his podcast that he was offered the job to replace Jackie Martling, but turned it down primarily due to Sterns show being located in New York as well as his commitment to Loveline.

{{quotation  The lesson you learned from a sexual harassment seminar was "Dont hire chicks." Do you hate working with women?

No. But they make you hire a certain number of chicks, and theyre always the least funny on the writing staff. The reason why you know more funny dudes than funny chicks is that dudes are funnier than chicks. If my daughter has a mediocre sense of humor, Im just gonna tell her, "Be a staff writer for a sitcom. Because theyll have to hire you, they cant really fire you, and you dont have to produce that much. Itll be awesome."

The "are women funny" debate has grown very contentious. Youre not worried about reactions to this?

I dont care. When youre picking a basketball team, youll take the brother over the guy with the yarmulke. Why? Because youre playing the odds. When it comes to comedy, of course theres Sarah Silverman, Tina Fey, Kathy Griffin – super-funny chicks. But if youre playing the odds? No. If Joy Behar or Sherri Shepherd was a dude, theyd be off TV. Theyre not funny enough for dudes. What if Roseanne Barr was a dude? Think wed know who she was? Honestly.}}

===Religious and political views===
Regarding his religious beliefs, Carolla has stated, "I am not agnostic. I am Atheism atheist. I dont think there is no God; I know theres no God. I know theres no God the same way I know many other laws in our universe. I know theres no God and I know most of the world knows that as well. They just wont admit it because theres another thing they know: they know theyre going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people dont have the courage to admit theres no God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out."<ref name="Atheism">{{cite web  title=Adam with Jeff Probst and Louis C.K.  url=http://adamradio.wordpress.com/2006/02/10/adam-with-jeff-probst-and-louis-ck/  work=The Official Adam Carolla Show Blog  date=February 2, 2006  accessdate=August 9, 2008  archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66A7ajJCB?url=https://adamradio.wordpress.com/2006/02/10/adam-with-jeff-probst-and-louis-ck/  archivedate=March 14, 2012  deadurl=yes  df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQMQxJKKjcU  title=Adam Carolla on religion  work=Youtube  date=February 5, 2008  accessdate=October 10, 2011}}</ref>

Regarding his political views, Carolla has stated, "I guess I would be Republican Party (United States) Republican, in the sense that I want a secure border, Im not into the Social programs in the United States welfare state, Im not into all those Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program freebie lunch programs. It just kind of demeans people." He goes on to state, however, that he is also in favor of typically Modern liberalism in the United States liberal causes such as the legalization of Cannabis (drug) marijuana and support for as well some Progressivism in the United States progressive causes such as "...&nbsp; [being] against Semi-automatic firearm semi-automatic and Automatic firearm automatic weapons. Im not an National Rifle Association NRA guy by any stretch of the imagination.
