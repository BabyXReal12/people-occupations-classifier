==Career==

===Harry Hills Fruit Corner (1993–1997)===
{{Main article Harry Hills Fruit Corner}}
Hill achieved his breakthrough in 1992, when he won the Perrier Award for Best Newcomer at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Shortly after, a radio show starring Hill was commissioned by BBC Radio 4 entitled Harry Hills Fruit Corner. Hill hosted the show as himself, and each week, he was joined by various guest performers, as well as regular character actors including Al Murray and Burt Kwouk. The show featured a variety of other celebrity guests during its run including Rolf Harris and Ronnie Corbett.

Each programme was interspersed with  Hills stand up routines. Fruit Corner ran for four series on BBC Radio 4.

===Fruit Fancies (1994)===
Hill made his television breakthrough in 1994, when he starred in BBC Two black and white silent comedy series Harry Hills Fruit Fancies. In a similar format to Fruit Corner, Hill would perform a series of sketches, with a number of celebrity guests making cameo appearances. The series also featured one of the characters from Fruit Corner, three year old Alan Hill Jr.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9sWJwfBKVE title=Harry Hills Fruit Fancies – Punch work=YouTube accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref>

The series ran for six episodes on BBC Two between October and December 1994. For Christmas that year, a VHS containing a one hundred minute compilation of the best material from the series, as well as unseen sketches, was released by BBC Video. It has since become a rare item.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Harry-Hill-fruit-Fancies/dp/B00004CQXC/ref=sr_1_fkmr2_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1345997375&sr=8-1-fkmr2 title=Harry Hills Fruit Fancies publisher=Amazon.co.uk accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref>

===Harry Hill (1997–2000)===
{{Main article Harry Hill (TV series) l1=Harry Hill}}
From May 1997 onwards, Hill presented his own Channel 4 television sketch series, Harry Hill (TV series) Harry Hill, which ran for three series between 1997 and 2000. The show was a television adaptation of Fruit Corner.

Among the regular characters were Hills big brother, Alan, played by comedian Al Murray, and his adopted son, Alan Jr., played by Dr Matt Bradstock. Burt Kwouk also appeared in many episodes of the programme, as Harrys "Chicken Catcher" – and each week, he would come up with an excuse as to why he has not yet captured a chicken, followed by a performance of the song Hey Little Hen. In later series, Hill and Kwouk appeared in sketches as Karl Lagerfeld and Gianni Versace.

Hills screen wife Mai Sung also made several appearances on the show, mainly around the theme of trying to steal his Abbey National bank savings book. Another character that featured on the show was Stouffer the Cat, a glove puppet cat made from blue rubber. Stouffer would normally sit in a throne, supported by a rubber arm in the style of Rod Hull, and was employed to intimidate guests during Hills standup routines. Some of Stouffers famous catchphrases are "he got a big face" and "sorted – respect due".

At the end of each episode, an event called "The Badger Parade" was supposed to take place. The parade featured a number of puppet badgers that included Gareth Southgate badger and Tasmin Archer badger, among others – however, every week, there would be some kind of problem, resulting in the badgers being unable to perform. In place of the badger parade, Hill would usually sing a song, with a guest that he had invited onto the show. A tie-in book relating to the series was released in October 1998, entitled Harry Hills Fun Book.

The series was cancelled in April 2000, but was revived in March 2003, as The All-New Harry Hill Show, this time by ITV (TV network) ITV, who broadcast it along with episodes of TV Burp. Regular features on the ITV version included the Hamilton Challenge, featuring Neil Hamilton (politician) Neil and Christine Hamilton, and a butterfly in blue jeans. The Channel 4 series was revisited in August 2012, for a humorous retrospective documentary entitled Whatever Happened to Harry Hill? {{as of 2017}}, neither the Channel 4 nor ITV series have been released on DVD.

===Harry Hills TV Burp (2001–2012)===
{{main article Harry Hills TV Burp}}
In October 2001, Hill moved to ITV (TV channel) ITV in a lucrative deal, in which he created an all new show, Harry Hills TV Burp, where he would take a look at the weeks television, showing clips from various British television programmes, and framing them with commentary or intercutting additional footage.

The series would feature a regular stable of all new characters, including the Knitted Character, a small, knitted rabbit, Wagbo, a demon love child whose parents are reportedly The X Factor (UK series 7) Wagner Carillho and Mary Byrne of The X Factor (UK TV series) X Factor fame, an interpretation of Heather Trott from EastEnders, played by Steve Bernham, as well as a doll of The Apprentice (UK TV series) The Apprentice star Alan Sugar, who would regularly rap before clips of The Apprentice were introduced.

The show was piloted in December 2001, before running for eleven full series between 2002 and 2012, before being cancelled to allow Hill to work on other projects. The show won a number of BAFTA awards, and spawned five Best of TV Burp DVD compilations, and a book based on the series, which was released for Christmas 2009.

===Youve Been Framed (2004–present)===
{{main article Youve Been Framed!}}
Since 2004, Hill has narrated the comical clips show Youve Been Framed!, often shortened to YBF! replacing Jonathan Wilkes on the show. Hill has narrated thirteen series to date. New episodes of Youve Been Framed! are still being recorded and air on early Saturday evenings on ITV (TV channel) ITV.

===Harry Hills Shark Infested Custard (2005)===
{{main article Harry Hills Shark Infested Custard}}
In October 2005, Hill moved into new territory with Harry Hills Shark Infested Custard, a thirteen part show broadcast in the CITV childrens television slot, on ITV Network ITV. While many of his well known characters, such as Stouffer and Garry Hill, his fictional layabout son from his first marriage, remained, it also showcased several new characters, including Speed Camera Boy, an outsider who is half boy and half Road safety camera speed camera, and Evelynne Hussey, a one-woman band who played a number of different instruments.

While the show featured a game show element, Help the Aged, it was very similar in structure to Harry Hill (TV series) Harry Hill. In the show, Hill wore a pale yellow, custard coloured shirt, with a giant collar, instead of his usual white collar.

The series was never released on DVD; however, it did spawn Harry Hills Whopping Great Joke Book, a book of childrens jokes, released in 2006. The book was also made available as an iPhone application.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://harryhillsjokebookapp.com/  title=Harry Hills Whopping Great Joke Book – The app for iPhone and iPod Touch  publisher=Harryhillsjokebookapp.com  accessdate=2011-10-24  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019090316/http://harryhillsjokebookapp.com/  archivedate=19 October 2011  df=dmy-all }}</ref> A second book, Harry Hills Bumper Book of Bloopers, was released for Christmas 2011.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Harry-Hills-Bumper-Book-Bloopers/dp/0571281745/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1346000380&sr=1-1 title=Harry Hills Bumper Book of Bloopers: Amazon.co.uk: Harry Hill: Books publisher=Amazon.co.uk accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref>

===Stars in Their Eyes (2015)===
{{main article Stars in Their Eyes}}
Hill presented a revived version of the ITV talent show Stars in their Eyes.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week3/harry-hills-stars-their-eyes title=Harry Hill’s Stars In Their Eyes Episode 1 publisher=}}</ref> The series aired for six episodes from 10 January until 14 February 2015. The revival has proved divisive. Fans of the original format were critical of it, saying that Hill had made the show about himself rather than the contestants.

In April 2015, it was announced that the show had been axed by ITV, due to extremely poor ratings.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a642410/harry-hills-stars-in-their-eyes-has-it-been-axed-by-itv.html title=Stars in Their Eyes: Has it been axed? date=17 April 2015 publisher=}}</ref>

===Harry Hills Tea Time (2016–present)===
Tea Time saw Hill welcome guests to a spoof comedy kitchen and ask them to cook bizarre things. A new entertainment series for Sky 1, the first series debuted on 16 October 2016, and was viewed by 400,000 viewers. Ratings slipped the following week, when only 180,000 watched. Guests for the first series included Paul Hollywood, Joey Essex, Gok Wan, Martin Kemp and Jason Donovan. 

Harry Hills Tea Time was commissioned for a second series which began airing in January 2018.

===Harry Hills Alien Fun Capsule (2017–present)===
In March 2017, Hill began presenting 6x30minute episode of Harry Hills Alien Fun Capsule, which airs on ITV (TV network) ITV on Thursday nights, 8.30 to 9&nbsp;pm.

The panel show sees Harry welcoming two teams of two celebrity guests as they are tasked with saving planet Earth from alien invasion by sending evidence (via the "fun capsule" of the title) that Earthlings are good fun and therefore worthy of saving from destruction. Harry alludes to the premise of the show as being rather tenuous in a running joke during each shows introduction, before introducing the two teams of guests, usually a mix of comedians and television stars.

In a similar style to Harry Hills TV Burp, the show includes various clips from television and film, often attributed or related somehow to the current guests. The guests also partake in sketches and songs based on or directly spoofing the funny or bizarre items featured. There is a regular slot entitled "Local News Round Up", accompanied by its own theme tune, which involves each of the guests taking turns to read out bizarre headlines from local newspapers. Alan the Alien also appears as a green extra terrestrials arm, emerging from a box to aid Harry in some way.

The series has received positive reviews, with many pointing out the similarities to TV Burp.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/harry-hills-superb-alien-fun-10006119 title=Harry Hills superb Alien Fun Capsule is a bit like TV Burp repeating itself first=Ian last=Hyland date=10 March 2017 publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-03-02/what-is-harry-hills-alien-fun-capsule-on-itv-is-it-any-good title=What is Harry Hills Alien Fun capsule on ITV?
