Eric Idle (born 29 March 1943) is an English comedian, actor, voice actor, author, singer-songwriter, musician, writer and comedic composer. Idle was a member of the British surreal comedy group Monty Python, a member of the parody rock band The Rutles, and the author of the Broadway musical Spamalot.

==Early life and education==
Idle was born in Harton Hospital, in South Shields in County Durham, to which his mother had been evacuated from the north west of England. His mother, Norah Barron (Sanderson),
was a health visitor, and his father, Ernest Idle,
served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, only to be killed in a hitch-hiking accident shortly after the war.
Idle spent part of his childhood in Wallasey on the Wirral Peninsula Wirral peninsula,
and attended St Georges Road primary school until he was nine.
His mother had difficulty coping with a full-time job and bringing up a child, so when Idle was seven, she enrolled him in the Royal Wolverhampton School as a boarding school boarder. At this time, the school was a charitable foundation dedicated to the education and maintenance of children who had lost one or both parents.
Idle is quoted as saying: "It was a physically child abuse abusive, bullying, harsh environment for a kid to grow up in. I got used to dealing with groups of boys and getting on with life in unpleasant circumstances and being smart and funny and subversive at the expense of authority. Perfect training for Python."
