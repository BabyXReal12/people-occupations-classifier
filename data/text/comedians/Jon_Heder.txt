A 2002 alumnus of Brigham Young University, Heder worked on the short Computer-generated imagery CGI animated film Pet Shop, written by Logan Deans, which earned a non-traditional animation student Emmy in 2005. After his movie career took off, he did not return to complete the work he started on the short, although his name does appear in the credits. While attending BYU he befriended Jared Hess and starred in Hess short film Peluca, which was later expanded into Napoleon Dynamite.  Peluca received rave reviews on the BYU campus after showing at a few college and local film festivals and competitions.

==Career==
Napoleon Dynamite, filmed in Preston, Idaho, earned $44.5 million at the box office.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/napoleon_dynamite title=Napoleon Dynamite publisher=Rotten Tomatoes accessdate=February 7, 2015}}</ref> In June 2005, Heder received the MTV Movie Award for Best Musical Performance and Breakthrough Male Performance for the role. On October 8, 2005, he hosted Saturday Night Live with musical guest Ashlee Simpson. After his success with Napoleon Dynamite, Heder and his film co-star Efren Ramirez filmed a series of commercials to promote the Utahs 2005 State fair State Fair. They reprised their roles in a self-parody sketch called "Napoleon Bonaparte Napoleon Bonamite" on the animated series Robot Chicken. {{cn date=February 2015}}

Heder appeared in the film The Sasquatch Gang. He had a supporting role as a clerk in a new age bookstore in the romantic comedy Just Like Heaven (film) Just Like Heaven. Heder also appeared with Rob Schneider and David Spade in producer Adam Sandlers The Benchwarmers (2006), a comedy about three grown men making up for lost chances by creating their own Little League baseball team. He was the voice of the character Skull in the animated film Monster House (film) Monster House, and starred in the comedy School for Scoundrels (2006 film) School for Scoundrels, opposite Billy Bob Thornton and Jacinda Barrett. With the exception of the Academy Award-nominee Monster House, Heders post-Dynamite movies were widely panned{{Citation needed date=March 2009}} and he risked becoming a one-hit wonder until he co-starred in 2007 with Will Ferrell in the well-received Blades of Glory (2007). Like many of Heders films, Blades of Glory is an absurd, slapstick caricature, in this case revolving around rival male figure skaters who must team up in a pairs competition.

Heders second turn at voice acting came in 2007 when he voiced the character of Chicken Joe, a surfing chicken, in the animated film Surfs Up (film) Surfs Up. His first foray into web television was in the 2008 web series Woke Up Dead starring and produced by Heder.<ref>[http://news.tubefilter.tv/2008/07/28/jon-heder-to-star-in-and-produce-electric-farms-woke-up-dead/ Jon Heder To Star in Electric Farm’s ‘Woke Up Dead’]</ref> Woke Up Dead is a web-based, live-action sci-fi comedy thriller about Drex, a twenty-something USC student who wakes up underwater in the bathtub one morning and suspects that he might be dead.

Heder and his twin brother, Dan, star together as villains in the fourth installment of the popular internet martial arts comedy series Sockbaby. Heders performance in When in Rome (2010 film) When in Rome was praised by New York Times critic A. O. Scott: "Jon Heder as a goofy street magician is the funniest of the bunch."<ref>Chris Hicks. Deseret News, February 5, 2010, p. W1</ref> In 2012, Heder returned to the role that made him famous by supplying the voice of Napoleon Dynamite in the Fox Network animated series, Napoleon Dynamite (TV series) Napoleon Dynamite, which debuted in January 2012. In 2013, Heder appeared in the music video for "On Top of the World (Imagine Dragons song) On Top of the World" with numerous other Utah-based actors and musicians, and in 2014 he appeared in the music video for the Chromeo song "Old 45s".<ref>{{cite web title=Chromeo - Old 45s url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y44jY-DrLYM&feature=youtu.be&t=4m42s accessdate=March 24, 2018}}</ref>

In January 2017, Heder reprised his role as Chicken Joe in the Surfs Up 2: WaveMania direct-to video sequel to Surfs Up.
