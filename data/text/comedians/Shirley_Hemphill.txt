Shirley Ann Hemphill (July 1, 1947 &ndash; December 10, 1999) was an American stand-up comedian and actress.

A native of Asheville, North Carolina, Hemphill moved to Los Angeles in the 1970s to pursue a career as a stand-up comedian. After working the Los Angeles comedy club circuit, her routine eventually attracted attention leading to her being cast in guest starring roles on television. In 1976, she landed the role of waitress Shirley Wilson on the sitcom Whats Happening!!  The series was a modest hit for American Broadcasting Company ABC, but production and cast problems caused ABC to cancel the series in 1979. The following year, Hemphill was cast in her own sitcom, One in a Million (US TV series) One in a Million. The series failed to attract an audience and was canceled in June 1980.

In 1985, Hemphill reprised her role as Shirley Wilson in the Broadcast syndication syndicated revival of Whats Happening!! titled Whats Happening Now!!  Like its predecessor, Whats Happening Now!! aired for three seasons. After the shows cancellation, Hemphill returned to stand-up comedy and also made occasional appearances in films and television.

In December 1999, Hemphill died of renal failure at her West Covina, California, home at the age of 52.

An aspiring stand-up comedian, Hemphill sent a cassette tape of one of her comedy routines to Flip Wilson. Wilson was impressed by her routine and in turn, sent her a cassette recorder and a dozen roses. Wilson also invited Hemphill to visit the set of The Flip Wilson Show. After the visit, Hemphill returned to her job in Asheville but decided to pursue a career in comedy instead. She quit her job and traveled to Los Angeles by bus. Hemphill got a job waitressing during the day and performed at The Comedy Store at night.<ref name="merced">{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=K6BcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WVgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4793,3189114&dq=shirley+hemphill&hl=en title=Shirley Hemphills career has taken off in a taxicab last=Buck first=Jerry date=February 6, 1980 work=Merced Sun-Star page=6 accessdate=January 15, 2013}}</ref><ref name="ebony">{{cite journal title=Whats Happening!!: ABCs popular teen-age sitcom succeeds in spite of itself journal=Ebony publisher=Johnson Publishing Company volume=33 issue=8 page=82 issn=0012-9011 url=https://books.google.com/?id=CM4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA74&dq=mabel+king+what%27s+happening#v=onepage&q=mabel%20king%20what%27s%20happening&f=false date=June 1978}}</ref>

==Career==

Instead, she auditioned and won the role of waitress Shirley Wilson on the American Broadcasting Company ABC sitcom Whats Happening!!.<ref name="merced" /> Loosely based on Eric Montes film Cooley High, the series follows the adventures of three teenaged boys: Raj (Ernest Lee Thomas Ernest Thomas), Rerun (Fred Berry), and Dwayne (Haywood Nelson).
