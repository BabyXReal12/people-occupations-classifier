Ward also had a joke ridiculing Jérémy Gabriel, a disabled boy with Treacher Collins syndrome who was 12 years old when first ridiculed by Ward. Jérémys parents filed a complaint with the Quebec human rights commission, and the commission brought the case in front of Quebec’s Human Rights Tribunal seeking $80,000 in damages from Ward. On July 20, 2016, he was ordered to pay $42000 ($35000 to Jérémy, $7000 to his mother). His attorney, Julius Grey appealed the decision.<ref>{{cite news last=  first=  date=20 July 2016 title=Mike Ward devra verser 35 000 $ à Jérémy Gabriel url=http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/arts_et_spectacles/2016/07/20/005-humoriste-mike-ward-condamnee-verser-35000-dollars-jeremy-gabriel.shtml location=Montreal newspaper=Ici Radio-Canada access-date=2016-07-21}} {{fr}}</ref><ref>{{cite news last=Sioui first=Marie-Michèle date=21 July 2016 title=Mike Ward condamné à une amende de 42 000 $ url=http://www.ledevoir.com/societe/justice/475941/mike-ward-condamne-a-une-amende-de-42-000 location=Montreal newspaper=Le Devoir access-date=2016-07-21}} {{fr}}</ref>
