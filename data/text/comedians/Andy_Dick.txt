In January 2011, Dick was thrown out of the AVN Awards, a pornographic movie awards ceremony, after repeatedly groping and stalking adult film actress Tera Patrick and drag queen Chi Chi LaRue.<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/annoying_andy_gets_the_boot_smV3yBUFLZGyjZQvnvMjGJ title=Annoying Andy Gets the Boot newspaper=New York Post date=November 1, 2011 accessdate=June 2, 2011}}</ref> He later claimed to have stayed clean for at least three months after this relapse.{{citation needed date=November 2017}}

In April 2011, Dick was at a party connected with the Newport Beach Film Festival. He appeared Alcohol intoxication intoxicated, exposed himself, urinated on a backdrop and afterwards destroyed it by pulling it down.

In August 2011, Dick was a guest on Greg Fitzsimmons radio show and made antisemitic statements about Howard Stern. Dick said Stern was a "Stereotypes of Jews#Greed money grubbing Jew" and repeatedly called him a "Jewish nose hook-nosed Jew".<ref>{{cite news  first=Adam  last=Rathe  url=http://nation.foxnews.com/howard-stern/2011/08/18/andy-dick-goes-anti-semitic-tirade-against-howard-stern title=Andy Dick Goes on Anti-Semitic Tirade Against Howard Stern newspaper=New York Daily News  date=August 18, 2011 accessdate=August 18, 2010}}</ref> Dick later stated he had written an apology letter to Stern.<ref name="HowardSternApologyLetter">{{cite AV media year=2011 title=12/14/2011 Adam Carolla & Andy Dick talk about his broken friendship with Howard Stern language=English url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7ddP4Hq6Cc accessdate=July 12, 2015}}</ref>

In October 2017, Dick was fired from a role in the independent film Raising Buchanan due to allegations of inappropriate behavior which, according to The Hollywood Reporter, "included groping peoples genitals, unwanted kissing/licking and sexual propositions of at least four members of the production". While he denied most of the allegations, he said "I might have kissed somebody on the cheek to say goodbye and then licked them. Thats my thing – I licked Carrie Fisher at a roast. Its me being funny."<ref>{{cite web last1=Gardner first1=Chris title=Andy Dick Fired From Movie Over Sexual Harassment Claims url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/andy-dick-fired-movie-sexual-harassment-claims-1053162 work=The Hollywood Reporter accessdate=2 November 2017}}</ref> It would later be revealed that in the same month he had also been fired and escorted off the set from another film, Vampire Dad, due to what was referred to as "multiple, flagrant acts of improper conduct and inappropriate contact with several crew members".<ref name="Vampiredad">{{cite web last1=Gardner first1=Chris title=Andy Dick Fired From Second Movie Over Sexual Misconduct Claims url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/andy-dick-fired-second-movie-sexual-misconduct-claims-1053547 work=The Hollywood Reporter accessdate=2 November 2017}}</ref> He later said "I overtook my medication and took too many Xanax and I was a bit loopy". He said "I wont do it anymore. I wont lick anyones face anymore. We have an agreement."<ref name="Vampiredad"/>

===Feud with Jon Lovitz===
On July 10, 2007, Dick and former Newsradio costar Jon Lovitz got into a physical confrontation at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. The two had a history of several previous disagreements concerning the death of their mutual friend Phil Hartman. According to Lovitz, Dick had given Hartmans wife Brynn cocaine at a Christmas party at Hartmans house in 1997; Brynn, a recovering addict, fell back into drug use, culminating in her killing Hartman and herself on May 28, 1998. When Lovitz joined the cast of Newsradio as Hartmans replacement, he and Dick got into an argument in which Lovitz reportedly said, "I wouldnt be here if you hadnt given Brynn coke in the first place." Lovitz reportedly later apologized to Dick for the remark.<ref>{{cite web last=Johnson first=Caitlin url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dick-and-lovitz-fight-over-the-dead title=Dick and Lovitz Fight over the Dead website=CBS News date=July 17, 2007 accessdate=November 2, 2017}}</ref>

In early 2007, Dick approached Lovitz at a restaurant and said "I put the Phil Hartman hex on you—youre the next to die."<ref name="cbsnews">{{cite web last=Faber first=Judy url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lovitz-speaks-out-on-dustup-with-andy-dick title=Jon Lovitz Speaks Out on Dustup with Andy Dick website=CBS News date=July 18, 2007 accessdate=November 2, 2017}}</ref> At the Laugh Factory, Lovitz demanded an apology from Dick, who refused and accused Lovitz of blaming him for Hartmans death. Lovitz then smashed Dicks head into the bar.<ref name="cbsnews"/>
