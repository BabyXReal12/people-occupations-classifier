Shortly after the first episode premiered, SAG/AFTRA issued a "Do Not Work" notice to its members due to Foxs choice to make the show a non-union production.

In December 2014, FOX Television announced a 20-episode extension of the series, bringing the total first season run to 39 episodes.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/stevehofstetter/posts/10154969870960604</ref>

=== Hofstetter vs. The Cable Guy ===

In March 2006, Hofstetter and Razor & Tie announced the April 4 release of Cure for the Cable Guy, a 45-minute CD/DVD that featured a cover with a Larry the Cable Guy Doll hanging by a coax cable. The disc earned Stuff Magazine<nowiki></nowiki>s "Album cover of the month". Later that week, Larry the Cable Guys new film debuted and was universally panned. Several movie reviewers discussed Hofstetters album, including the Orlando Sentinel{{}}s Roger Moore.<ref>{{cite web url=http://deseretnews.com/movies/view/1,1257,425000817,00.html title=Your Familys Media Guide - Ok.com<!-- Bot generated title --> publisher= accessdate=May 9, 2018 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930191303/http://deseretnews.com/movies/view/1,1257,425000817,00.html archivedate=September 30, 2007 df=mdy-all}}</ref> Moores review was picked up by dozens of papers across the country, including the Chicago Tribune,<ref>{{cite web  url=http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/movies/mmx-060324-movies-review-larry,0,648696.story?coll=mmx-movies_top_heds  title=Archived copy  accessdate=2006-10-03  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311023456/http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/movies/mmx-060324-movies-review-larry,0,648696.story?coll=mmx-movies_top_heds  archivedate=March 11, 2007  df=mdy-all }}</ref> Denver Post,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.denverpost.com/movies/ci_3639437 title=“Cable Guy” needs healthy joke infusion date=March 25, 2006 publisher= accessdate=May 9, 2018}}</ref> and Columbus Dispatch.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.mix971.net/events/calendar.php?story=dispatch/2006/03/25/20060325-B4-02.html title=Mix971.net: The Leading Mix Site on the Net<!-- Bot generated title --> publisher= accessdate=May 9, 2018 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814004431/http://www.mix971.net/events/calendar.php?story=dispatch%2F2006%2F03%2F25%2F20060325-B4-02.html archivedate=August 14, 2014 df=mdy-all}}</ref> Hofstetter did radio interviews about the album, including one with Philadelphias  Kidd Chris show, where Hofstetter spoke with Larry the Cable Guys alter ego, Dan Whitney. Whitney ended the interview with his catch phrase, "Git-R-Done."

The albums cover was compared to the Sex Pistols "Pink Floyd Sucks" T-shirts. Allmusics Bret Love wrote, "Hofstetter effectively rebels against the mainstream by positioning himself as the antithesis of the worlds most popular comedian. What could be more punk rock than that?"<ref>{{cite web url=http://shop.vh1.com/Cure-for-the-Cable-Guy-Standup-Comedy_stcVVproductId4269323VVcatId424044VVviewprod.htm title=New Music Videos, Reality TV Shows, Celebrity News, Pop Culture - VH1 website=VH1 accessdate=May 9, 2018 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000728/http://shop.vh1.com/Cure-for-the-Cable-Guy-Standup-Comedy_stcVVproductId4269323VVcatId424044VVviewprod.htm archivedate=March 4, 2016 df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In July, an article in the The New Yorker New Yorker quoted Whitney as saying Hofstetter had been hurtful, and Whitneys manager criticizing Hofstetter for "trying to make a buck". In response, Hofstetter posted a video on YouTube explaining his stance on the Cable Guy and his comedy.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVzeT6KofYM title=Why I Cured the Cable Guy (Steve Hofstetter) first= last=Steve Hofstetter date=July 6, 2006 publisher= accessdate=May 9, 2018 via=YouTube}}</ref>
