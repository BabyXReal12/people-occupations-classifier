==Career==
=== Laughs ===

Shortly after the first episode premiered, SAG/AFTRA issued a "Do Not Work" notice to its members due to Foxs choice to make the show a non-union production.

In December 2014, FOX Television announced a 20-episode extension of the series, bringing the total first season run to 39 episodes.
=== "The Heckler Destroyer" ===
Hofstetter earned a reputation for lashing out at hecklers,
and some of his anti-heckler YouTube clips reached over five million views. His channel reached over 90 million in total. Hofstetter credits the popularity to justice. He told the Orlando Sentinel, "People like seeing other people get what they deserve" and "You cant fake a heckler clip. People are excited to see someone whos ruining everyone elses time get their comeuppance."
=== Sports and comedy ===

Though a comedian by trade, Hofstetter is also a sports writer. He has served as the Senior Comedy Correspondent for FOX Sports "Just a Bit Outside".
A former Sports Illustrated columnist, Hofstetter is also the co-creator of "Hofstetters Jerk of the Week", a satirical sports website that chronicled the misdeeds of athletes.

=== Pay-What-You-Want ===
In December 2007, Hofstetter announced his new album, Dark Side of the Room. While the album has a shelf date of March 2008, listeners are allowed to download it directly from his website with "Pay-What-You-Want" à la Radioheads 2007 album In Rainbows.
Hofstetter is believed to be the first comedian to try the new model, and early returns reaffirm Radioheads success.
=== Hofstetter vs. The Cable Guy ===

In March 2006, Hofstetter and Razor &amp; Tie announced the April 4 release of Cure for the Cable Guy, a 45-minute CD/DVD that featured a cover with a Larry the Cable Guy Doll hanging by a coax cable. The disc earned Stuff Magazine
s "Album cover of the month". Later that week, Larry the Cable Guys new film debuted and was universally panned. Several movie reviewers discussed Hofstetters album, including the Orlando Sentinel{{}}s Roger Moore.
Moores review was picked up by dozens of papers across the country, including the Chicago Tribune,
Denver Post,
and Columbus Dispatch.
Hofstetter did radio interviews about the album, including one with Philadelphias  Kidd Chris show, where Hofstetter spoke with Larry the Cable Guys alter ego, Dan Whitney. Whitney ended the interview with his catch phrase, "Git-R-Done."

The albums cover was compared to the Sex Pistols "Pink Floyd Sucks" T-shirts. Allmusics Bret Love wrote, "Hofstetter effectively rebels against the mainstream by positioning himself as the antithesis of the worlds most popular comedian. What could be more punk rock than that?"
In July, an article in the The New Yorker New Yorker quoted Whitney as saying Hofstetter had been hurtful, and Whitneys manager criticizing Hofstetter for "trying to make a buck". In response, Hofstetter posted a video on YouTube explaining his stance on the Cable Guy and his comedy.
