==Career==
Following national service, Corbett moved to London to start his acting career.<ref name=guardobit/> At {{convert 5 ft 1 in m abbr=on}} tall, Corbett was suited to playing roles younger than his years.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0179196/bio title=Ronnie Corbett publisher=IMDb access-date=1 April 2016}}</ref> References to his height frequently cropped up in his self-deprecating humour. In one of his earliest stage appearances, he was billed as "Ronald Corbett" at Cromer in Take it Easy in 1956, with Graham Stark.<ref name=bbc/> He appeared in Crackerjack (TV series) Crackerjack as a regular in its early days, one episode with Winifred Atwell. He had a walk-on in an early episode of the 1960s series The Saint (TV series) The Saint (as "Ronald Corbett") and appeared in films including Youre Only Young Twice (film) Youre Only Young Twice (1952), Rockets Galore! (1957), Casino Royale (1967 film) Casino Royale (1967), Some Will, Some Wont (1970) and the film version of the farce No Sex Please, Were British (film) No Sex Please, Were British (1973).

The marriage lasted 49 years, until he died.<ref name=bbc/>

=== With David Frost ===
Corbett first worked with Ronnie Barker in The Frost Report (1966–67). The writers and cast were mostly Oxbridge graduates from the Footlights tradition. Corbett said he and Barker were drawn together as two Grammar schools in the United Kingdom grammar school boys who had not gone to university. The show was a mixture of satirical monologues, sketches and music. Corbett and Barker were beginning to be thought of as a pair.

They appeared with John Cleese in one of the most repeated comedy sketches in British television: the Class sketch. Corbetts height provided a key cue for both the visual humour and satirical value of the sketch, as he "looked up" to both Cleese and Barkers characters, and he got the punch line pay-off line: "I get a pain in the back of my neck."<ref name = BBC>{{cite web  url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thefrostreport/  title=BBC&nbsp;– Comedy&nbsp;– The Frost Report  publisher=BBC  accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref>

Continuing under Frost, Corbett starred in No – Thats Me Over Here!, a sitcom written by Frost Report writers Barry Cryer, Graham Chapman and Eric Idle (ITV (TV network) ITV 1967–70). Cryer and Chapman wrote two follow-ups: Now Look Here (BBC 1971–73) and The Prince of Denmark (BBC 1974). Corbett also appeared in Frost on Sunday (ITV 1968) and hosted The Corbett Follies (ITV 1969).<ref name=guardobit/>

He was a subject of the television programme This Is Your Life (UK TV series) This Is Your Life in April 1970 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews while appearing on the Frost on Sunday programme.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.bigredbook.info/ronnie_corbett.html  title=Ronnie CORBETT (1930-2015)

=== The Two Ronnies ===
Corbetts BBC television comedy show with Ronnie Barker, The Two Ronnies, ran from 1971 to 1987. Barker and Corbett performed sketches and musical numbers. Corbett presented a monologue. Sitting in a large easy chair (emphasising his small size), and usually wearing a Lyle & Scott golfing V-neck sweater, he would stretch telling a simple joke over several minutes, often allowing himself to appear to lose his train of thought.<ref name=guardobit/>

===Later work===
Corbetts best-known role away from The Two Ronnies was as the 40-something Timothy Lumsden, dominated by his mother, in the sitcom Sorry! (TV series) Sorry! (1981–88).<ref>{{cite news   url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/03/31/ronnie-corbett-a-fine-comic-and-an-entertainment-treasure/   work = The Daily Telegraph   accessdate = 31 March 2016   date = 31 March 2016   title = Ronnie Corbett: A fine comic and an entertainment treasure   first = Michael   last = Hogan}}</ref> In 1996, he appeared on the première of the short-lived BBC game show Full Swing (game show) Full Swing, hosted by Jimmy Tarbuck.<ref name=guardobit>{{cite web   url = https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/31/ronnie-corbett-obituary   work = The Guardian   title = Ronnie Corbett obituary   first = Stuart   last = Jeffries   accessdate = 31 March 2016   date = 31 March 2016}}</ref> Corbett played Reggie Sea Lions in the film Fierce Creatures (1997), written by his former Frost Report colleague John Cleese.<ref name=guardobit/>

Corbett hosted the game show Small Talk (UK game show) Small Talk and played minor parts occasionally since its end – such as Griselda in a television production of Cinderella in 2000, and reviving his armchair monologue routines for a weekly appearance in a stand-up show hosted by Ben Elton. In 2003, he appeared in advertisements for the Sky+ digital television service alongside Alice Cooper. The premise was a running gag about their being happy housemates. In December 2004, Corbett appeared on the BBC news quiz Have I Got News for You.

In 2005, Corbett teamed up again with Ronnie Barker for The Two Ronnies Sketchbook, comedy sketches from their original series with newly recorded linking material. Also in March 2005, Corbett appeared with comedian Peter Kay in the music video for the number one single "Is This the Way to Amarillo?" to raise money for Comic Relief. Corbett is remembered for accidentally falling on the treadmill that was out of shot in the Chroma key green screen video; however, he found the fall funny when played back, and it was kept in the final version. He performed in Childrens Party at the Palace as Mr Tibbs, the Elizabeth II Queens butler.
