==Career==
===Television===
File:Sharon Strzelecki (7879439094).jpg thumb upright Sharon Strzelecki is one of Szubanskis most developed characters
In 1985, while performing in a University of Melbourne Law Revue of Too Cool for Sandals, with Michael Veitch and Tom Gleisner, Szubanski was talent-spotted by producers from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), who convinced her to join up with some other university friends in creating a television sketch comedy show, The D-Generation.<ref>{{cite web title=Magda Szubanski (Mondo Things: Cheat Notes, episode 30) url=http://www.abc.net.au/thingo/txt/s1204560.htm work=Mondo Things publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation ABC accessdate=11 March 2014}}</ref>

Szubanski was part of the team that created the television sketch comedy Fast Forward (TV series) Fast Forward for the Seven Network, in which she played various characters, including Pixie-Anne Wheatley, Chenille from the Institute de Beauté, Wee Mary MacGregor, Joan Kirner, Michelle Grogan and other characters. The character of Lynne Postlethwaite was first performed on the ABCs The D-Generation. It was originally written by John Allsop and Andrew Knight, but from Fast Forward on Szubanski co-wrote the sketches, and created and co-wrote her characters.

In 1995, she and friends Gina Riley and Jane Turner wrote, performed and produced the first all-female Australian sketch comedy television program; Big Girls Blouse. When Riley and Turner developed the sketch-characters they had created into the sitcom Kath & Kim (Australian TV series) Kath & Kim, Szubanski joined them to play Sharon Strzelecki, a character she had previously created herself.

Her character Sharon "pashed" (Australian slang for vigorous kissing) and "married" Australian cricketing legend Shane Warne. She also "pashed" the late Australian actor Heath Ledger on the red carpet at the AFI awards in 2006 while in the role of Sharon, acting as an assistant stage manager.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3285393/Viral-video-late-actor-Heath-Ledger-kissing-squealing-comedian-Magda-Szubanski-red-carpet-resurfaces.html title=Viral video of Heath Ledger kissing Magda Szubanski resurfaces publisher=}}</ref>

In 1999, Szubanski created, wrote, co-produced and starred as Margaret OHalloran in the Dogwoman series of TV films, a detective style show based on the idea an expert "dog-whisperer" who, by treating problem dogs, inadvertently stumbles upon and solves human crimes.

In 2006, she hosted a five-part series on the Nine Network, called Magdas Funny Bits, which showed "never-before-seen" footage of some of her most famous characters from the comedy show Fast Forward. Branded as "no frills", it attracted insufficient ratings and did not continue. She had a similar short-lived result as host of the Network Ten clip show The Spearman Experiment in 2009.

In 2009, she appeared on Who Do You Think You Are? (Australian TV series) Who Do You Think You Are? where she explored her fathers Polish Resistance activities as well as the story of her shell-shocked Irish grandfather and her sculptor ancestor Luigi Isepponi who assisted in making the Death mask for William Burke, half of the duo Burke and Hare, notorious grave robbers and serial killers.

On 3 September, Szubanski will appear as Jemina Davies-Smythe on Neighbours where she will officiate the wedding of characters Aaron Brennan and David Tanaka, the first gay wedding on Australian television.<ref>https://www.nova969.com.au/entertainment/magda-szubanski-has-joined-cast-neighbours</ref>

===Film===
Szubanski starred in the 1995 film Babe (film) Babe as Esme Hoggett. She reprised her role in the 1998 sequel, Babe: Pig in the City. She then teamed up again with director/producer George Miller to voice the role of Miss Viola in the animated films Happy Feet and Happy Feet Two.

In 2007, she had a minor role as Mrs. Lonsdale, the housemaid in The Golden Compass (film) The Golden Compass to Lyra Belacqua.

===Author===
In 2015, Szubanski released her award-winning memoir Reckoning. In 2016 Magda’s memoir Reckoning won several awards and beat some of Australia’s top literary authors to win the TBA<ref>{{Cite web url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/books/nsw-premiers-literary-awards-szubanski-beats-grenville/news-story/0efbf5cb511d4ac827793798fae96eee title=Subscribe to The Australian {{!}} Newspaper home delivery, website, iPad, iPhone & Android apps website=www.theaustralian.com.au language=en access-date=2018-03-16}}</ref>. Reckoning also won the $40,000 Douglas Stewart Prize for Nonfiction,<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/books/nsw-premiers-literary-awards-szubanski-beats-grenville/news-story/0efbf5cb511d4ac827793798fae96eee title=Subscribe {{!}} theaustralian website=www.theaustralian.com.au access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref> and "Book of the Year" and "Biography of the Year" at the Australian Book Industry Awards.<sup>[3]</sup>

While the book is nominally an autobiography, it is in large part about her father Zbigniew Szubanski, who was an assassin working for the Polish Resistance during World War 2. Reckoning deals with the themes of intergenerational trauma, the possible genetic inheritance of traumatic memory and Szubanskis struggles with her own sexuality in the shadow of this legacy.

Reviewer Peter craven in The Australian said it would "dazzle every kind of reader" and described it as "a riveting, overwhelmingly poignant autobiography by a woman of genius. It is a book about how someone might live with the idea of killing the thing they love. It is a story of love and death and redemption and a daughters love for her father. It is an extraordinary hymn to the tragic heroism at the heart of ordinary life and the soaring moral scrutiny of womankind. Every library should have it, every school should teach it."<ref>{{Cite news url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/magda-szubanskis-memoir-reveals-a-woman-of-substance/news-story/023cf36199ab61155a4f96e631f693f1 title=A woman of substance date=2 October 2015 access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>

Richard Ferguson in The Sydney Morning Herald wrote, "This is documentary writing of the highest order and Szubanski has given life to an incredible war story…Reckoning, this tale of war and suburbia, sexuality and comedy, is likely to be the most popular Australian book of the year. Anyone who doesnt adore Magda Szubanski the clown will be awed by Szubanski the A-grade non-fiction writer. Lets hope the books keep on coming."<ref>{{Cite news url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/m17booksrev2-20151008-gk4e1o.html title=Book review: In Reckoning,  Magda Szubanski pays homage to her assassin dad last=Ferguson first=Richard date=16 October 2015 newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald language=en-US access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>

Academy Award Winner and friend Geoffrey Rush launched her book and wrote in The Guardian: "I was absorbed in preparing for King Lear when I read the book. The classical stature of that particular father-daughter relationship didnt go unnoticed. Magda grew up in the shadow of a difficult reckoning — the summation, the questioning, the Elizabethan sense of settling the bill with ones parents. As she phrases it: her father needed to forget— she needed to remember. The only way forward was back. Her book riffs a major life in a reflective minor key. Ive got lost in Joyces Dublin, Woolfs Bloomsbury, the Bronte Sisters Yorkshire moors. Now Im enthralled with Magda Szubanskis Croydon, Australias own collective sub-conscious suburb, the architecture of which she deftly anoints as Bauhauss "bastard child"…Reckoning is really a non-fiction novel – and its invitation into Magdas story is infectious."<ref>{{Cite news url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/15/in-praise-of-magda-szubanski-kath-and-kims-class-clown-and title=The chameleon comedian who charmed a country: Geoffrey Rush on Magda Szubanski last=Rush first=Geoffrey date=14 October 2015 newspaper=The Guardian language=en-GB issn=0261-3077 access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>

The Premiers Award judges described Reckoning as warm, clear, wise, funny and deeply intelligent. The amplitude of Szubanskis writing is particularly impressive. Her voice has a light surety, while constantly giving narrative and moral weight to the larger themes of grief, family, migration and finding ones place in the world."<ref>{{Cite news url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/magda-szubanskis-memoir-reckoning-finds-its-place-in-the-world-of-winners-20160518-goyd8h.html title=Magda Szubanskis memoir Reckoning finds its place in the world of winners last=Wyndham first=Susan date=20 May 2016 newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald language=en-US access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>

===Musical theatre===
In 2007, Szubanski ventured into musical comedy, taking on the role of William Barfee in the Melbourne Theatre Company production of the hit Broadway musical The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee. Variety described her performance as "sensationally good."<ref>{{Cite news url=https://variety.com/2006/legit/reviews/the-25th-annual-putnam-county-spelling-bee-2-1200518790/ title=Review: The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee last=Kemp first=Peter H. date=5 February 2006 newspaper=Variety language=en-US access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref> Australian Stage said, "Magda Szubanski as the Eric Cartman-esque William Barfee steals the show."<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.australianstage.com.au/reviews/sydney/the-25th-annual-putnam-county-spelling-bee-460.html title=The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee website=www.australianstage.com.au access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>

In 2008, she again participated in some gender-blind casting, taking on the role of pint-sized gangster Big Jule in a major stage production of Guys and Dolls.

In 2010, she appeared in the first Indigenous Musical film Bran Nue Dae as Roadhouse Betty alongside Geoffrey Rush, Ernie Dingo, Missy Higgins and Deborah Mailman. The film was directed by Rachel Perkins, daughter of the Aboriginal activist Charles Perkins (Aboriginal activist) Charlie Perkins.

In 2012, she again teamed with Rush to appear in the Stephen Sondheim musical A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.
