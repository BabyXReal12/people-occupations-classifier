In 2000, Green stated, "God is, to me, pretty much an idea. God is, to me, pretty much a myth created over time to deny the idea that were all responsible for our own actions."
He later clarified in 2013:

{{blockquote text=I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I find it sad and unfortunate how many wars are fought and lives are lost in a quest to insist that someone else pray the same way you do. I have a deep belief in the divinity of the Universe, and I had no ability to really comprehend the scope or magnitude of all the things that I dont understand. But Ive never been the guy who says I dont believe in God or I dont believe in some kind of overlaying, governing force that makes everything symmetrical and Ive never been interested in being anyones spokesman, whether its organized religion or the opposite. Im my own spokesperson. I take great pains to always say I only speak for me.
