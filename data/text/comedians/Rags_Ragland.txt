Ragland made his show business reputation in burlesque. He quickly became known for his wild ad-libs, unpredictable intrusions into other comics acts, and a "healthy off-stage libido". Eventually he worked his way up to "top banana" at Minskys Burlesque Minskys, the dominant burlesque house.
Minsky striptease star Georgia Sothern remembered him fondly in her 1971 memoir, saying she considered Ragland a close friend and the funniest comedian the Minskys had ever produced.
His longtime performing partner Phil Silvers referred to Ragland in his autobiography as "my favorite comic".
After burlesque in its classic style died, Ragland made his way to Broadway theatre and films. He usually playing good-natured oafs with a knack for fracturing the English language. He became a  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) contract player beginning with 1942s Panama Hattie (film) Panama Hattie, reprising a role he played on Broadway. Ragland appeared in around two dozen MGM light comedies and musicals. He gained popularity as Red Skeltons cohort in the "Whistling" movies (Whistling in the Dark (1941 film) Whistling in the Dark, Whistling in Dixie, and Whistling in Brooklyn). His final film appearance was in the drama  The Hoodlum Saint (1946).

==Death==
After returning from an alcoholic bender with Orson Welles in Mexico in 1946, Ragland was scheduled to revive his New York nightclub act with friend Phil Silvers at the Copacabana (nightclub) Copacabana. He began experiencing pain in his abdomen and was hospitalized. Good friend Frank Sinatra called in a specialist, but the doctors determined that Raglands liver and kidneys were destroyed from years of alcohol abuse. After falling into a coma, he died, three days before his 41st birthday, of uremia. Silvers and Sinatra were by his bedside. Many Hollywood celebrities attended Raglands funeral – Sinatra sang at the service and Silvers delivered the eulogy.{{citation needed date=June 2017}}

In a gesture of friendship and respect, Sinatra left the set of his movie It Happened in Brooklyn, flew to New York, and unexpectedly showed up to take Raglands spot with Silvers at the Copacabana debut (Silvers had decided to continue because he had signed a contract, stating "the show must go on"). Sinatra and Silvers did the routines they had performed during their USO tours. The show brought down the house. It ended with Silvers saying in tears, "May I take a bow for Rags." The audience was silent, crying in tribute to Ragland.
