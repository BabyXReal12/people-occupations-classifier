===New Years Eve incident===
On December 31, 2013, Leggero was criticized for a joke she made during NBCs New Years Eve with Carson Daly, when, in response to a controversial Twitter tweet posted by SpaghettiOs on the anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor Pearl Harbor attack, she quipped: "It sucks that the only survivors of Pearl Harbor are being mocked by the only food they can still chew." Her remarks were met with a backlash over social media; in response, Leggero posted in a blog entry that she did not feel that "the amazing courage of American veterans and specifically those who survived Pearl Harbor is in any way diminished by a comedian making a joke about dentures on television. Do we really believe that the people who fought and defended our freedom against Nazis and the Axis powers will find a joke about Spaghetti Os too much to bear? Sorry, I have more respect for Veterans than to think their honor can be impugned by a glamorous, charming comedian in a fur hat." She also called on those offended by the remarks to donate to Disabled American Veterans.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/tv-highlights-networks-compete-for-most-entertaining-new-years-show/2013/12/30/3826f0fa-715a-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html author=Rachel Lubitz title=TV highlights: Networks compete for most entertaining New Year’s show work=The Washington Post accessdate=January 6, 2014 date=December 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news author=Margaret Eby title=Comedian Natasha Leggero responds to controversy over World War II veteran joke: Im not sorry url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/comedian-natasha-leggero-responds-controversy-world-war-ii-veteran-joke-article-1.1566225 work=Daily News (New York) New York Daily News date=January 4, 2014 accessdate=January 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web author=Drew Grant title=Comedian Natasha Leggero is Sorry/Not-Sorry About SpaghettiO-Gate url=http://observer.com/2014/01/comedian-natasha-leggero-is-sorrynot-sorry-about-spaghettio-gate/ work=The New York Observer accessdate=January 6, 2014}}</ref>

==Comedic style==

<blockquote>
All performers have a character to some extent, but Leggero is one of the few with a costume. She’s like a wolf in sheep’s clothing, but like a seasoned comedian in socialite’s clothing. She’s always been this way. Who is the most formally dressed being at every Roast? Natasha Leggero. Who is perhaps the only person to have ever worn long white gloves to the Laugh Factory? Natasha Leggero. It’s always like she’s going to another party. While other comedians are trying to out-casual each other, she’s sitting with impeccable posture, dripping diamonds, dripping disdain.<ref>{{cite web work=GQ title=Nobody in Comedy Commits Like Natasha Leggero author=Lange, Maggie url=https://www.gq.com/story/nobody-commits-like-natasha-leggero date=August 21, 2015 accessdate=December 23, 2016}}</ref></blockquote>
