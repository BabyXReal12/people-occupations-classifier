==Early life==
Ferrell was born in Irvine, California,
to Betty Kay (née Overman; born 1940), a teacher who taught at Old Mill School elementary school and Santa Ana College,
and Roy Lee Ferrell Jr. (born 1941). His parents were both natives of Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, and moved to California in 1964.
Ferrells ancestry includes English Americans English, German Americans German, and Irish Americans Irish.
He has a younger brother named Patrick.
When he was eight years old, his parents divorced. Ferrell said of the divorce: "I was the type of kid who would say, Hey, look at the bright side! Well have two Christmases." The divorce was amicable and both parents were committed to their children. The biggest problem was his fathers line of work. As a person in show business, his paychecks were never steady and he was gone from home months at a time. Growing up in this environment made Ferrell not want to go into show business, but get a steady job.
Will first attended school at Culverdale Elementary
and later attended Rancho San Joaquin Middle School, both in Irvine, CA. He attended University High School (Irvine, California) University High School in Irvine, and was a Placekicker kicker for the schools varsity American football football team.
He was also on the soccer team and captain of the basketball team, as well as serving on the student council. Ferrell called third grade "a pivotal year". He realized he could make his classmates laugh if he pretended to smash his head against the wall, or if he tripped and fell on purpose, and said it was a great way to make friends.
He said the dullness of Irvine contributed to the growth of his humor:

{{quote Growing up in suburbia, in safe, master-planned Irvine, there was no drama so we had to create it in our heads. My main form of entertainment was cracking my friends up and exploring new ways of being funny. I didnt have to have the survival mode instinct like other comics, who grew up in tough neighborhoods. I had the opposite. For me, I grew up in Mayberry, and the humor broke the boredom. And there was a lot to make fun of.
}}

In his senior year of high school, Ferrell and a friend would perform comedy skits over the schools intercom system, with cooperation from the principal; the two had to write their own material. Ferrell also performed comedic skits in the schools talent shows. He won the "Best Personality" superlative voted by his classmates.
He enrolled at the University of Southern California, where he studied sports broadcasting and joined the Delta Tau Delta Fraternity. In college, he was known for a few pranks. On occasion, he would dress in a janitors outfit and stroll into his friends classes. He was also known for streaking around campus with a few other people from the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.
Ferrell earned an internship at a local television station in the sports department, but he did not enjoy the work.
After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts B.A. degree in sports information in 1990, he knew he did not want to do broadcasting. He took up a job as a hotel valet where, on his second day, he tore a baggage rack off the top of a van by trying to drive it under a low-lying beam. He also worked as a teller at Wells Fargo, but came up short $300 the first day and $280 the second; he was not stealing the money, but was just careless and error-prone. In 1991, encouraged by his mother to pursue something he liked, Ferrell moved to Los Angeles. He successfully auditioned for the comedy group The Groundlings, where he spent time developing his Improvisational comedy improvisation skills.
==Career==

===The Groundlings===

Before joining The Groundlings, Ferrells attempts at standup comedy had little success. He started in the advanced classes and grew to love improvisation. He realized he also liked to impersonate people, and one of his favorites was Harry Caray, the Ford C. Frick Award Hall of Fame baseball announcer. Soon he began to create original characters. With fellow Groundlings member Chris Kattan, they created the Butabi Brothers, who go out to dance clubs to try to pick up women but are constantly rejected. While taking classes, Ferrell got a job at an auction house via his friend Viveca Paulin. The job was ideal as it was flexible enough for him to audition and go to rehearsals while also being employed. He received small roles, including TV series Grace Under Fire and Living Single, low-budget films such as A Bucket of Blood (1995 film) A Bucket of Blood, as well as commercials. One winter, he even served as a mall Santa Claus. Then, in 1994, he won a spot with the top professional group of The Groundlings.
===Saturday Night Live===
After SNLs decline in popularity in Saturday Night Live (season 20) 1994–1995 and in need of new cast members for the next season, a producer saw The Groundlings and asked Ferrell, Kattan, and Cheri Oteri to audition for SNLs main producer, Lorne Michaels.
Ferrell joined Saturday Night Live in 1995 and left in 2002 after a seven-year tenure. He has returned to host four times.
During his time on SNL, Ferrell made a name for himself with his impersonations, which included US President George W. Bush, Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray, singer Robert Goulet (crooner crooning a cappella pieces of music by Sisqó, Baha Men, and The Notorious B.I.G.), singer Neil Diamond, Inside the Actors Studio host James Lipton (who favored Ferrells impersonation), Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, United States Attorney General Janet Reno, convicted unabomber Ted Kaczynski, game show host Alex Trebek, fictitious private detective John Shaft Shaft, professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, U.S. Vice President Al Gore, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and Cuban President Fidel Castro.

His original characters included Morning Latte co-host Tom Wilkins, Mister Ed Ed the Horses twin brother Ned, fictional Blue Öyster Cult member Gene Frenkle (physically modeled after the bands vocalist Eric Bloom), music teacher Marty Culp, Spartan cheerleader Craig Buchanan, Dale Sturtevant from Dissing Your Dog, Hank of the Bill Brasky Buddies, David Leary from Dog Show, and night clubber Steve Butabi in a sketch that was turned into a feature film in 1998s A Night at the Roxbury. Ferrell became the highest paid cast member of Saturday Night Live in 2001 with a season salary of $350,000.
Ferrell returned to Saturday Night Live as a guest host on May 14, 2005; May 16, 2009; May 12, 2012; and January 27, 2018. For the first two hosting appearances, he reprised his role as Alex Trebek in the "Celebrity Jeopardy! (Saturday Night Live) Celebrity Jeopardy" sketches. On the May 14 appearance, Ferrell reprised his role as Robert Goulet in a fake commercial advertising a series of ringtones and, during the performance of the song "Little Sister (Queens of the Stone Age song) Little Sister" by musical guests Queens of the Stone Age, Ferrell came on stage playing the Cowbell (instrument) cowbell.

}}
They followed with the release of a video entitled "Good Cop, Baby Cop" which also starred baby Pearl;

In 2007, Autograph magazine named Ferrell the worst celebrity autographer. Its editor stated: "Whats so frustrating about Will Ferrell being the worst autograph signer this past year is that he used to be so nice to fans and collectors and a great signer. What makes him so bad is that hell taunt people asking for his autograph."
In response, Ferrell stated: "I dont know how I got on the list. I sign a lot of autographs." He has, however, admitted to taunting autograph-seekers: "I do. I really do. Im like, How badly do you want this autograph? Are you sure? You say youre my biggest fan, really, prove it. Ill do things like that. They have to earn it."
Ferrell had noted that, although he was well known for his SNL impersonation of President George W. Bush, he chose, for both professional and political reasons, not to meet the President on several occasions, unlike his SNL predecessor Dana Carveys famous relationship with George H. W. Bush: "I declined, partly out of comedic purposes, because when I was on the show Saturday Night Live at the time, it didnt make sense to really meet the people that you play, for fear of them influencing you. And then the other side of it is, from a political standpoint, I dont want to meet that guy."
Ferrell also appeared on an episode of Man vs. Wild, where he traveled throughout the tundras of Sweden with the shows host, Bear Grylls. In the episode, Ferrell came across various unique situations, which included eating the eye of a reindeer.
