His siblings were Lillian, Harry, Jack, Saul, Pearl, Michael, and Reuben Silver. His father, a sheet metal worker, helped build the early New York skyscrapers.

Silvers started entertaining at age 11, when he would sing in theaters when the film projector broke down (a common occurrence in those days), to the point where he was allowed to keep attending the same movie theater free of charge, to sing through any future breakdowns.<ref name=master>[http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/artist/phil-silvers "Phil Silvers"] masterworksbroadway.com, accessed November 25, 2011</ref> By age 13, he was working as a singer in the Gus Edwards Revue, and then worked in vaudeville and as a burlesque comic.<ref>{{cite book last=Monush first= Barry title=Screen World Presents the Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors: From the silent era to 1965 year=2003 publisher= Hal Leonard Corporation ISBN=1-55783-551-9 page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=toTIb1Ek2WwC&pg=PA681&lpg=PA681&dq=%22Phil+Silvers%22+%22This+Laugh+Is+On+Me%22&source=bl&ots=ek0036OgNE&sig=ntlkIhyt02VCsdV_v5HOayb3pOw&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22Phil%20Silvers%22%20%22This%20Laugh%20Is%20On%20Me%22&f=false "Phil Silvers" 681]}}</ref>

Silvers next worked in short films for the Vitaphone studio, such as Ups and Downs (1937 film) Ups and Downs (1937), and on Broadway theatre Broadway, where he made his début in the short-lived show Yokel Boy in 1939. Critics raved about Silvers, who was hailed as the bright spot in the mediocre play.<ref>{{cite book  last= Bordman  first= Gerald and Norton, Richard  page=575 (link: [https://books.google.com/books?id=OVdShkzkX74C&pg=PA575&dq=%22Yokel+Boy%22+%22Phil+Silvers%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22Yokel%20Boy%22%20%22Phil%20Silvers%22&f=false Yokel Boy])  title= American Musical Theatre: A Chronicle  year=2010  publisher= Oxford University Press  ISBN= 0-19-972970-0}}</ref> The Broadway revue High Kickers (1941) was based on his concept.<ref>{{cite book last=Suskin first= Steven title=The Sound of Broadway Music year=2011 publisher= Oxford University Press  ISBN= 0-19-979084-1 page=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yy_9UJLhAUMC&lpg=PT407&pg=PT407#v=twopage&q&f=false 123]}}</ref>

Silvers also appeared in Lady Be Good (1941 film) Lady Be Good (1941), Coney Island (1943 film) Coney Island (1943), Cover Girl (film) Cover Girl (1944) and Summer Stock (1950).<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.fandango.com/philsilvers/filmography/p65703 title=Phil Silvers Filmography publisher=www.fandango.com accessdate= November 25, 2011}}</ref> When the studio system began to decline, he returned to the stage. Cover Girl demonstrates that Silvers was an accomplished dancer, performing flawlessly in quick-tempo trios with famed dancers Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth.

Silvers wrote the lyrics for Frank Sinatras "Nancy (With the Laughing Face)". 
Although he was not a songwriter, he wrote the lyrics while visiting composer Jimmy Van Heusen. The two composed the song for Van Heusens writing partner Johnny Burke, for his wife Bessies birthday. Substituting Sinatras little daughters name Nancy at her birthday party, the trio pressed the singer to record it himself. The song became a popular hit in 1945 and was a staple in Sinatras live performances.<ref>{{cite book url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yw40lISdzJkC&pg=PA443&dq=Van+Heusen+%22Phil+Silvers%22+%22Nancy%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=Van%20Heusen%20%22Phil%20Silvers%22%20%22Nancy%22&f=false title= Frank Sintra : The Complete Guide publisher=Google eBook accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref> Towards the end of the Second World War, Silvers entertained the troops during several successful overseas United Service Organizations USO tours with Sinatra.<ref>{{cite book last=Andrews first= Maxene; Gilbert, Bill year=1993 title= Over Here, Over There: The Andrews Sisters and the USO Stars in World War II publisher= Thorndike Press  ISBN= 978-0-7862-0094-8 page=200}}</ref>

Silvers scored a major triumph in Top Banana (musical) Top Banana, a Broadway show of 1952. Silvers played Jerry Biffle, the egocentric, always-busy star of a major television show.

He repeated the role in Top Banana (film) the 1954 film version that was originally released in 3-D film 3-D.<ref name=master/>

According to the documentary on the DVD of Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Silvers was not a traditional comedian: he was a comic actor. Silvers never did stand-up, and, out of character, he was not known for cracking jokes.

Silvers became a household name in 1955 when he starred as Sergeant Ernest G. Bilko in Youll Never Get Rich, later retitled The Phil Silvers Show. The military comedy became a television hit, with the opportunistic Bilko fast-talking his way through one obstacle after another. In 1958, CBS switched the show to be telecast on Friday nights and moved the setting to Camp Fremont in California. A year later, the show was off the schedule.<ref name=museum>Gomery, Douglas.[http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=silversphil "Phil Silvers"]The Museum of Broadcast Communications (museum.tv), accessed November 25, 2011</ref>

Silvers was offered the leading role of conniving Roman slave Pseudolus in the Broadway musical comedy A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Silvers declined,<ref name=master/> and the role went instead to Zero Mostel, who was so successful in the role that he repeated the role in the 1966 film version. By this time, Silvers realized his error, and agreed to appear in the film as a secondary character, flesh merchant Marcus Lycus. When actor-producer Larry Blyden mounted a Broadway revival of Forum in 1972, he wanted Phil Silvers to play the lead, and this time Silvers agreed.<ref>Green, Stanley and Green, Kay.[https://books.google.com/books?id=KDKFHniTy1YC&pg=PA198&dq=%22A+Funny+Thing+Happened%22+%22Phil+Silvers%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22A%20Funny%20Thing%20Happened%22%20%22Phil%20Silvers%22&f=false "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"]Broadway Musicals, Show by Show (1996), Hal Leonard Corporation, {{ISBN 0-7935-7750-0}}, p.198</ref> The revival was a hit and Silvers became the first leading actor ever to win a Tony Award in a revival of a musical.
