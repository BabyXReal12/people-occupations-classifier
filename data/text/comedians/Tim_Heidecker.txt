==Early life==
Heidecker was born and raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania. He attended Allentown Central Catholic High School and Temple University.
==Career==
Heidecker and Wareheim first became known as the creators, writers, and stars of Tom Goes to the Mayor, a limited animation series that originally aired from November 2004 to September 2006 on the Adult Swim channel.  Tim plays "Tom," the protagonist of the show. He continually brings his ideas to the Mayor (played by Wareheim), who ends up thwarting them in most cases and leaving Tom worse off than when he started. According to their website  Wareheim and Heidecker had mailed copies of an early version of the show to comedian Bob Odenkirk, who agreed to take on the project as the executive producer of the series and sold it to Adult Swim.
The duos next show, Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, premiered on February 11, 2007 on Adult Swim. The eleven-minute show features "live action, sketch, animation, emotions, phone calls, love, etc."

Heidecker starred in Tim and Erics Billion Dollar Movie. Wareheim and Heidecker appeared together as Collection agency Debt Collectors on the Adult Swim special, Young Persons Guide to History The Young Persons Guide to History and have made guest appearances in the movie Lets Go to Prison, as well as the Scottish video game series VideoGaiden and a Version 2 episode of Mega64.
Heidecker also had a small role in the 2011 film Bridesmaids (2011 film) Bridesmaids, and a leading role in the 2012 independent drama The Comedy (film) The Comedy, directed by Rick Alverson and also starring Wareheim. In July 2012, Heidecker starred in an episode of Workaholics. 
In August 2012, he guest starred in Dinosaur Jr.s music video "Watch the Corners."
In the same year, Heidecker made a cameo appearance on the independent movie reviewing site, Red Letter Media. Heidecker appeared in an episode of the RedLetterMedia series, "Half in The Bag." The episode is titled, "Season Finale: Step Up Revolution." Within the short sketch comedy, Heidecker plays a VCR repair man named "Tim". Shortly after his introduction into the scene, he flies through the ceiling and makes his exit from the skit.
Heidecker starred in a series of films for Absolut Vodka Absolut Vodkas website with Wareheim and Zach Galifianakis.  In March 2010, Heidecker and Wareheim directed a series of Old Spice commercials starring actor Terry Crews. Using characters and skits from Awesome Show, Heidecker and Wareheim (via their Abso Lutely Productions company) created an online-only show called "Tim and Eric Nite Live!," originally broadcast on the website SuperDeluxe.

Since 2012 Heidecker has been hosting a parodic web series and podcast called On Cinema, where he and special guest (Gregg Turkington) discuss films from past and present. In 2013 an On Cinema Film Guide app was released, featuring the voices of Heidecker and Turkington reviewing over 17,000 films.

==Music==
Heidecker played in various indie rock bands while in Philadelphia. He made an appearance in the 2008 Ben Folds and Regina Spektor music video entitled "You Dont Know Me (Ben Folds song) You Dont Know Me".

Although Davin Wood composed the music for Awesome Show, Heidecker would sometimes sing and write lyrics. Williams Street Records released both Awesome Record, Great Songs! and Uncle Muscles Presents Casey And His Brother in 2008, featuring music from the first two seasons. Wood previously composed the music for Tom Goes To The Mayor, and he and Heidecker form the duo Heidecker &amp; Wood. Inspired by 1970s soft rock, they released their first album, Starting From Nowhere, on March 15, 2011.
The duo released a second album in the same style on November 12, 2013, Some Things Never Stay the Same. They cite the influence of Randy Newman, Warren Zevon, Harry Nilsson, and Boz Scaggs.
The duo will perform in October at Festival Supreme.
In October 2012, Heidecker contributed a parody campaign jingle for Herman Cains presidential bid titled "Cain Train".
This was the first of nine songs which would eventually become a full album, titled Cainthology: Songs in the Key of Cain. All of the proceeds from the albums sales go to benefit the Violence Intervention Program.
The number nine was chosen as the number of songs, and $9.99 the original price, in reference to Herman Cains 9-9-9 Plan 9-9-9 financial plan.

The day after the release of Bob Dylans album Tempest (Bob Dylan album) Tempest in September 2012, Heidecker released a song called "Titanic", which is a 15-minute-long spoof of the track on the album. In 2013, he released two more Dylan parodies—"Running Out the Clock", inspired by Dylans 1983 album Infidels (Bob Dylan album) Infidels, and "Long Black Dress", a song in the actual style of Dylans album Tempest—and collaborated with the indie band The Earth is a Man on a cover of Dylans "All the Tired Horses."

In December 2013, Heidecker released the album Urinal St. Station under the Drag City label with his band, The Yellow River Boys.
The lead single, "Hot Piss," was released in June 2013.
