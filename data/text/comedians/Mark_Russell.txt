==Career==
Russell is known for his series of PBS specials, aired live at least four times a year between 1975 and 2004. His comedy specials were a mix of political stand-up comedy covering current events and musical parodies, in which he accompanied himself on his trademark American flag themed piano. Russells song parodies use melodies from old standards with new humorous lyrics pertinent to the subject matter. For example, in 1990, following the execution of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu, Russell did a parody song on his show to the tune of "Chattanooga Choo-Choo". ("Pardon me, boys / Are you the cats who shot Ceauşescu? / You made my day / The way you blew him away.") Russell himself admits that most of his jokes and songs are very topical and have "a shelf life shorter than cottage cheese".{{citation needed date=October 2014}}

While Russells humor is known for skewering United States Democratic Party Democrats and United States Republican Party Republicans alike, his humorous tirades have also poked fun at Third party (politics) third party, Independent (politician) independent politicians and other prominent political (and sometimes non-political) figures.{{citation needed date=October 2014}}

Russell has often been asked the question, "Do you have any writers?" His standard response is "Oh, yes. I have 535 writers. 100 in the United States Senate Senate and 435 in the United States House of Representatives House of Representatives!" When asked if his views on current events are too caustic, Russell replies, "I follow the old newsmans adage. As they say, I dont make the news. I just report it. And in my case, I dont even make the jokes. I just report them as they masquerade as news."{{citation needed date=October 2014}}

For several years, on the Sunday before Labor Day, Russell has made an annual appearance on the NBC news program Meet the Press, which was hosted from 1991–2008 by Tim Russert, also a Canisius High graduate.

Beginning in the early 1960s, he was a regular entertainer at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C..{{citation needed date=October 2014}} He gained national recognition with a series of comedy albums during the Watergate scandal{{citation needed date=October 2014}} and did his first public television show in 1975. From 1979 to 1984, he was a semi-regular host on the reality TV show, Real People.

In 1994, Russell found himself unexpectedly allied with the rap group 2 Live Crew, when the group was sued for copyright infringement for their parody of the song "Oh, Pretty Woman". The case went to the Supreme Court of the United States Supreme Court, where Russell and the members of 2 Live Crew argued that song parodies were protected under fair use. The Supreme Court agreed, and ruled in favor of Russell and 2 Live Crew (Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.).{{citation needed date=October 2014}}

In 2010, Russell announced his retirement from public performances and made his last public performance in July 2010 in Chautauqua, New York. He continues to write political humor for various venues.<ref name=Russell_Website_Retirement>{{cite web accessdate=October 25, 2011
