Tony Belmont, executive director of the National Comedy Hall of Fame in St. Petersburg, Florida, said of Callas upon his death: "There were two things he did that made his career. He could think very fast on his feet, and he had an unbelievable number of sounds that he made with his voice. He would tell a joke about two guys hunting.  If you or I told it, the joke wasnt so funny.  But Charlie made it hysterical by sticking in these sounds; so you would hear the gun cocking, the duck flying overhead, the explosion of the shotgun and then the duck falling and screaming all the way to the ground."
