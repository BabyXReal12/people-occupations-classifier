Dudley Stuart John Moore, Order of the British Empire CBE (19 April 1935{{spaced ndash}}27 March 2002) was an English actor, comedian, musician and composer.

Moore first came to prominence in the UK as one of the four writer-performers in the comedy revue Beyond the Fringe from 1960, and with one member of that team, Peter Cook, collaborated on the television series Not Only... But Also. The double act worked on other projects until the mid-1970s, by which time Moore had settled in Los Angeles to concentrate on his film acting.

His solo career as a comedy film actor was heightened by the success of hit Hollywood films, particularly Foul Play (1978 film) Foul Play (1978), 10 (film) 10 (1979) and Arthur (1981 film) Arthur (1981). For Arthur, Moore was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won a Golden Globe Award. He received a second Golden Globe for his performance in Micki & Maude (1984).

==Early life==
Moore was born at the original Charing Cross Hospital in central London, the son of Ada Francis (née Hughes), a secretary, and John Moore, a railway electrician. His father was Scottish, from Glasgow.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1389041/Dudley-Moore.html  title=Obituaries: Dudley Moore  publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited – Telegraph.Co.UK  date=22 March 2002  accessdate=23 April 2016}}</ref> 
Moore was brought up in Dagenham, Essex. He was notably short at {{convert 5 ft 2 in m abbr=on}} and was born with club feet that required extensive hospital treatment and, coupled with his diminutive stature, made him the butt of jokes from other children. His right foot responded well to corrective treatment and had straightened itself by the time he was six, but his left foot became permanently twisted and consequently his left leg below the knee was withered. This was something of which he remained very self-conscious throughout his life.

Moore became a choirboy at the age of six. At age eleven he earned a scholarship to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama Guildhall School of Music, where he took up harpsichord, organ, violin, musical theory and composition.<ref name=official>{{cite web  url=http://dudleymoore.com/about/bio.htm  title=The Official Site of Dudley Moore: Biography  publisher=The Estate of Dudley Moore - DudleyMoore.com  accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref> He rapidly developed into a highly talented pianist and organist and was playing the pipe organ at local church weddings by the age of 14. He attended The Sydney Russell School Dagenham County High School where he received musical tuition from a dedicated teacher, Peter Cork, who became a friend and confidant to Moore and continued to correspond with him until 1994.

Moores musical talent won him an organ scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was tutored by the composer Bernard Rose (musician) Bernard Rose.<ref name=official/><ref name="rose">{{cite news   title=Bernard Rose (Obituary)   url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-bernard-rose-1312755.html   work=The Independent   date=3 December 1996   accessdate=28 May 2014 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822093958/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-bernard-rose-1312755.html  archivedate=22 August 2017 deadurl=no}}</ref> While studying music and composition there, he also performed with Alan Bennett in the The Oxford Revue Oxford Revue. During his university years, Moore had developed a love of jazz music and soon became an accomplished jazz pianist and composer. He began working with such leading musicians as John Dankworth and Cleo Laine.

In 1960 he left Dankworths band to work on Beyond the Fringe.

==Career==

===Beyond the Fringe===
File:Beyond the Fringe original cast.JPG thumb Moore (left) in Beyond the Fringe, c1963
Johnny Bassett John Bassett, a graduate of Wadham College, Oxford recommended Moore, his jazz bandmate and a rising cabaret talent, to producer Robert Ponsonby, who was putting together a comedy revue entitled Beyond the Fringe. Bassett also chose Jonathan Miller. Moore then recommended Alan Bennett, who in turn suggested Peter Cook.

Beyond the Fringe was at the forefront of the 1960s UK satire boom, although the shows original runs in Edinburgh and the provinces in 1960 had had a lukewarm response. When the revue transferred to the Fortune Theatre in London, in a revised production by Donald Albery and William Donaldson, it became a sensation, thanks in some part to a favourable review by Kenneth Tynan.<ref>Humphrey Carpenter That Was Satire That Was, pp. 122–23; Tynans review is extensively quoted.</ref> There were also a number of musical items in the show, using Dudley Moores music, most famously an arrangement of the Colonel Bogey March which resists Moores repeated attempts to bring it to an end.

In 1962 the show transferred to the John Golden Theatre in New York, with its original cast. President John F. Kennedy attended a performance on 10 February 1963. The show continued in New York until 1964.

===Partnership with Peter Cook===
When Moore returned to the UK he was offered his own series on the BBC, Not Only... But Also (1965, 1966, 1970). It was commissioned specifically as a vehicle for Moore, but when he invited Peter Cook on as a guest, their double act comedy partnership was so notable that it became a permanent fixture of the series. Cook and Moore are most remembered for their sketches as two working class men, Pete and Dud, in macs and cloth caps, commenting on politics and the arts, but they also fashioned a series of one-off characters, usually with Moore in the role of interviewer to one of Cooks upper class eccentrics.

The pair developed an unorthodox method for scripting the material, using a tape recorder to tape an ad-libbed routine that they would then have transcribed and edited. This would not leave enough time to fully rehearse the script, so they often had a set of cue cards. Moore was famous for corpsing — the programmes often went on live, and Cook would deliberately make him laugh in order to get an even bigger reaction from the studio audience. The BBC wiped much of the series, though some of the soundtracks (which were issued on record) have survived.

In 1968 Cook and Moore briefly switched to Associated TeleVision ATV for four one-hour programmes entitled Goodbye Again (TV) Goodbye Again, however, they were not as critically well-received as the BBC shows.

On film, Moore and Cook appeared in the 1966 British comedy film The Wrong Box, before co-writing and co-starring in Bedazzled (1967 film) Bedazzled (1967)<ref name=la>{{cite web  url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/dudley-moore/  title=Hollywood Star Walk: Dudley Moore  work=Patrick Kevin Day, Los Angeles Times - Projects.LATimes.com  date=23 February 2010  accessdate=23 April 2016}}</ref> with Eleanor Bron. The film was directed by Stanley Donen. The pair closed the decade with appearances in the ensemble caper film Monte Carlo or Bust and Richard Lesters The Bed Sitting Room (film) The Bed Sitting Room, based on the play by Spike Milligan and John Antrobus.

In 1968 and 1969 Moore embarked on two solo comedy ventures, firstly in the film 30 Is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia and secondly, on stage, for an Anglicised adaptation of Woody Allens Play It Again, Sam at the Gielgud Theatre Globe Theatre in Londons West End of London West End.

In the 1970s the relationship between Moore and Cook became increasingly strained as the latters alcoholism began affecting his work. However, in 1971, Cook and Moore took sketches from Not Only....But Also and Goodbye Again, together with new material, to create the stage revue Behind the Fridge. This show toured Australia in 1972 before transferring to New York City in 1973, re-titled as Good Evening. Cook frequently appeared on and off stage the worse for drink. Nonetheless, the show proved very popular and it won Tony Award Tony and Grammy Awards.

When the Broadway run of Good Evening ended, Moore stayed on in the U.S. to pursue his film acting ambitions in Hollywood, but the pair reunited to host Saturday Night Live on 24 January 1976 during the SNL first season. They performed a number of their classic stage routines, including "One Leg Too Few" and "Frog and Peach", among others, in addition to participating in some skits with the shows ensemble.

It was during the Broadway run of Good Evening that Cook persuaded Moore to take the humour of Pete and Dud farther on gramophone record long-playing records as Derek and Clive. Chris Blackwell circulated Bootleg recording bootleg copies to friends in the music business and the popularity of the recording convinced Cook to release it commercially as Derek and Clive (Live) (1976). Two further "Derek and Clive" albums, Derek and Clive Come Again (1977) and Derek and Clive Ad Nauseam (1978), were later released. The latter was also filmed for a documentary, Derek and Clive Get the Horn. In the film it is clear tensions between the two men were at a breaking point, with Moore at one point walking out of the recording room singing, Breaking up is so easy to do. In 2009, it came to light that, at the time, three separate British police forces had wanted them to be prosecuted under obscenity laws for their "Derek and Clive" comedy recordings.

The last significant appearance for the partnership was in 1978s The Hound of the Baskervilles (1978 film) The Hound of the Baskervilles, where Moore played Dr. Watson to Cooks Sherlock Holmes, as well as three other roles: in drag; as a one-legged man; and at the start and end of the film as a flamboyant and mischievous pianist. He also wrote the films score. Co-star Terry-Thomas described it as "the most outrageous film I ever appeared in&nbsp;... there was no magic&nbsp;... it was bad!".<ref>{{cite book last1=Thomas  first1=Terry last2=Daum first2=Terry title=Terry-Thomas Tells Tales: An Autobiography  date=1990 publisher=Robson Books isbn=9780860516620 page=117 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjQeAAAAMAAJ accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref> The film was not a success critically or financially.

Moore and Cook eventually reunited for the annual American benefit for the homeless, Comic Relief USA Comic Relief, in 1987, and again in 1989 for a British audience at the Amnesty International benefit The Secret Policemans Biggest Ball.

Moore was deeply affected by the death of Cook in 1995, and for weeks would regularly telephone Cooks home in London, just to hear his friends voice on the telephone answering machine. Moore attended Cooks memorial service in London and, at the time, many people who knew him noted that Moore was behaving strangely and attributed it to grief or drinking. In November 1995, Moore teamed up with friend and humorist Martin Lewis (humorist) Martin Lewis in organising a two-day salute to Cook in Los Angeles that Moore co-hosted with Lewis.

In December 2004 the Channel 4 television station in the United Kingdom broadcast Not Only But Always, a TV film dramatising the relationship between Moore and Cook, although the principal focus of the production was on Cook. Around the same time the relationship between the two was also the subject of a stage play called Pete and Dud: Come Again by Chris Bartlett and Nick Awde. For this production Moore is the main subject. Set in a chat-show studio in the 1980s, it focuses on Moores comic and personal relationship with Cook and the directions their careers took after the split of the partnership.

===Music===
During the 1960s he formed the Dudley Moore Trio, with drummer Chris Karan and bassist Pete McGurk. Following McGurks suicide in June 1968, Peter Morgan joined the group as his replacement.<ref>Chilton. John., 2004, Whos Who of British Jazz, London: Continuum, p.240 {{ISBN 9780826472342}}</ref>

Moores admitted principal musical influences were Oscar Peterson and Erroll Garner. In an interview he recalled the day he finally mastered Garners unique left-hand strum and was so excited that he walked around for several days with his left hand constantly playing that cadence. His early recordings included "My Blue Heaven (song) My Blue Heaven", "Lysie Does It", "Poova Nova", "Take Your Time", "(Back Home Again in) Indiana Indiana", "Sooz Blooz", "Baubles, Bangles & Beads", "Sad One for George" and "Autumn Leaves (1945 song) Autumn Leaves". The trio performed regularly on British television, made numerous recordings and had a long-running residency at Peter Cooks London nightclub, the The Establishment (club) Establishment. Amongst other albums, they recorded The Dudley Moore Trio, Dudley Moore plays The Theme from Beyond the Fringe and All That Jazz, The World of Dudley Moore, The Other Side Of Dudley Moore and Genuine Dud.

Moore was a close friend of record producer Christopher Gunning Chris Gunning and played piano (uncredited) on the 1969 single "Broken Hearted Pirates" which Gunning produced for Simon Dupree and the Big Sound.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2013/24/r2-sounds-of-the-60s.html  title=Sounds Of The 60s  publisher=bbc.co.uk  date=8 June 2013  accessdate=23 April 2016}}</ref> In 1976 he played piano on Larry Normans album In Another Land (album) In Another Land, in particular on the song The Sun Began to Rain. In 1981 he recorded Smilin Through with Cleo Laine.

He composed the soundtracks for the films Bedazzled (1967 film) Bedazzled (1967), 30 Is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia (1968), Inadmissible Evidence (film) Inadmissible Evidence (1968), Staircase (film) Staircase (1969), The Hound of the Baskervilles (1978 film) The Hound of the Baskervilles (1978) and Six Weeks (1982), among others.

===Later career in film, television and music===
In the late 1970s Moore moved to Hollywood, California Hollywood, where he had a supporting role in the hit film Foul Play (1978 film) Foul Play (1978) with Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase. The following year saw his breakout role in Blake Edwardss 10 (film) 10, which became one of the 1979 in film biggest box-office hits of 1979 and gave him an unprecedented status as a romantic leading man. Moore followed up with the comedy film Wholly Moses!, which was not a major success.

In 1981 Moore appeared in the title role of the comedy Arthur (1981 film) Arthur, an even bigger hit than 10. Co-starring Liza Minnelli and Sir John Gielgud, it was both commercially and critically successful, Moore receiving an Academy Award Oscar nomination for Best Actor, whilst Gielgud won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Arthurs stern but compassionate manservant. Moore lost to Henry Fonda (for On Golden Pond (1981 film) On Golden Pond). He did, however, win a Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Musical/Comedy. In the same year, on British television, Moore was the featured guest subject on An Audience With....

His subsequent films, Six Weeks (1982), Lovesick (1983 film) Lovesick (1983), Romantic Comedy (1983 film) Romantic Comedy (1983) and Unfaithfully Yours (1984 film) Unfaithfully Yours (1984) were only moderate successes, but he had another hit in 1984, starring in the Blake Edwards directed Micki & Maude Micki + Maude, co-starring Amy Irving. This won him another Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical/Comedy.

Later films, including Best Defense (1984), Santa Claus: The Movie (1985), Like Father Like Son (1987 film) Like Father Like Son (1987), Arthur 2: On the Rocks, a sequel to the original, Crazy People (1990), Blame It on the Bellboy (1992) and an The Mighty Kong animated adaptation of King Kong, were inconsistent in terms of both critical and commercial reception. Moore eventually disowned the Arthur sequel, but, in later years, Cook would wind him up by claiming he preferred Arthur 2: On the Rocks to Arthur.

In 1986 he once again hosted Saturday Night Live, albeit without Peter Cook this time.

Moore was the subject of the British This Is Your Life (UK TV series) This Is Your Life—for a second time—in March 1987 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at his Venice Beach restaurant; he had previously been honoured by the programme in December 1972.

In addition to acting, Moore continued to work as a composer and pianist, writing scores for a number of films and giving piano concerts, which were highlighted by his popular parodies of classical favourites. He also appeared as Ko-Ko in Jonathan Millers production of The Mikado in Los Angeles in March 1988.

In the 1990s Moore starred as a man named David trying to catch chickens in a series of popular Tesco adverts. He stated, in a later interview, that he was paid "£20,000 for each advert".{{citation needed date=August 2015}} In 1991 he released the album Songs Without Words and in 1992 Live From an Aircraft Hangar, recorded at Londons Royal Albert Hall.

He collaborated with the conductor Georg Solti Sir Georg Solti in 1991 to create a Channel 4 television series, Orchestra!, which was designed to introduce audiences to the symphony orchestra. He later worked with the American conductor Michael Tilson Thomas on a similar television series, Concerto! (1993), likewise designed to introduce audiences to classical music concertos.

Moore appeared in two series for CBS, Dudley (TV series) Dudley (1993) and Daddys Girls (1994 TV series) Daddys Girls (1994), however both were cancelled before the end of their run.

Moore had been interviewed for The New York Times in 1987 by the music critic Rena Fruchter, herself an accomplished pianist, and the two became close friends. By 1995 Moores film career was on the wane and he was having trouble remembering his lines, a problem he had never previously encountered. It was for this reason he was sacked from Barbra Streisands film The Mirror Has Two Faces.<ref name="Deat">{{cite news  title=Tributes flood in for Moore  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1898076.stm  publisher=BBC News  accessdate=25 August 2011 date=28 March 2002}}</ref> However, his difficulties were, in fact, due to the onset of the medical condition that eventually led to his death. Opting to concentrate on the piano, he enlisted Fruchter as an artistic partner. They performed as a duo in the US and Australia. However, his disease soon started to make itself apparent there as well, as his fingers would not always do what he wanted them to do. Further symptoms such as slurred speech and loss of balance were misinterpreted by the public and the media as a sign of drunkenness. Moore himself was at a loss to explain this. He moved into Fruchters family home in New Jersey and stayed there for five years, but this, however, placed a great strain both on her marriage and her friendship with Moore, and she later set him up in the house next door.

===Entrepreneur===
Moore co-owned, with producer Tony Bill, a fashionable restaurant in Venice, Los Angeles Venice, California (1980s–2000), named 72 Market Street Oyster Bar and Grill. He played the piano whenever he was there.{{citation needed date=May 2017}}

==Personal life==
Moore was married and divorced four times: to actresses Suzy Kendall (15 June 1968 - 15 September 1972), Tuesday Weld (20 September 1975 - 18 July 1980; by whom he had a son in 1976), Brogan Lane (21 February 1988 - 1991), and Nicole Rothschild (16 April 1994 - 1998; one son, born in 1995).<ref name=wives-times>{{cite news  url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-wives-and-times-of-cuddly-dudley-1337512.html  title=The wives and times of cuddly Dudley  author=Daniel Jeffreys  work=The Independent  date=17 June 1996  accessdate=23 April 2016}}</ref>

He maintained good relationships with Kendall, Weld and Lane, but expressly forbade Rothschild to attend his funeral. At the time his illness became apparent, he was going through a difficult divorce from Rothschild while at the same time sharing a house in Los Angeles with her and her previous husband.<ref name=wives-times/>

Moore dated Susan Anton in the early 1980s, with a lot of talk being made of their height difference: Moore at {{convert 5 ft 2+1/2 in m}} and Anton at {{convert 5 ft 11 in m}}.

==Illness and death==
In April 1997, after spending five days in a New York hospital, Moore was informed that he had calcium deposits in the basal ganglia of his brain and irreversible frontal lobe damage. In September 1997 Moore underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery in London. He also suffered four strokes.<ref name=disease>{{Cite news  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/461376.stm   title=Dudley Moore has rare brain disease  work=BBC News  date=30 September 1999  accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref>

In June 1998 Nicole Rothschild was reported to have told an American television show that Moore was "waiting to die" due to a serious illness, but these reports were denied by Suzy Kendall.<ref>{{Cite news  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/109902.stm  title=Health fears for Dudley Moore  work=BBC News  date=9 June 1998  accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref>

On 30 September 1999, Moore announced that he was suffering from the terminal degenerative brain disorder progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), some of the early symptoms being so similar to intoxication that he had been reported as being drunk, and that the illness had been diagnosed earlier in the year.<ref name=disease/>

Dudley Moore died on the morning of 27 March 2002,<ref name=la/> as a result of pneumonia, secondary to immobility caused by the palsy, in Plainfield, New Jersey at age 66. Rena Fruchter was holding his hand when he died, and she reported his final words were, "I can hear the music all around me".<ref>{{cite web  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6H8vBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT248  title=Theres Been A Life!  publisher= accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://lists.monstersandcritics.com/popculture/people/famous-last-words/  title=Famous last words  work=Julian James, Monster lists - Lists.MonstersAndCritics.com  accessdate=24 April 2016  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612111046/http://lists.monstersandcritics.com/popculture/people/famous-last-words/  archivedate=12 June 2016  df=dmy-all }}</ref> Moore was interred at Hillside Cemetery (Scotch Plains, New Jersey) Hillside Cemetery in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. Fruchter later wrote a memoir of their relationship (Dudley Moore, Ebury Press, 2004).

==Honours and awards==
In 1981 Moore won the Golden Globe for Best Actor for his role in Arthur, for which he was also Oscar-nominated. In November 2001, Moore was appointed a Order of the British Empire Commander of the Order of The British Empire (CBE). Despite his deteriorating condition, he attended the ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 16 November to collect his honour in a wheelchair.<ref name="Deat" />
