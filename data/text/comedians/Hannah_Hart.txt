===Hello Harto: The Tour Show===
On January 2, 2013, Hannah posted a video on YouTube stating that she was considering doing a world tour. She launched a campaign to fund this trip on Indiegogo, aiming to get $50,000 within a month. After a couple of hours, the $50,000 goal was already met. Hart decided to keep the funding going to her initial end date of February 2, 2013. Depending on the final amount of money, the tour would be expanded to Canada, Europe and Australia.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hello-harto?c=home title=HELLO, HARTO! – Indiegogo campaign page publisher=Indiegogo accessdate=June 23, 2015}}</ref> By February 2, she had raised over $220,000. The first leg of the tour kicked off in April 2013.

Hello Harto: The Tour Show consists of three parts: vlog, travel, and kitchen.<ref>{{cite AV media url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsnWERN267I title=HELLO, HARTO! (Ep. 1) - Leaving Los Angeles publisher=YouTube work=MyHarto date=April 23, 2013 accessdate=June 23, 2015}}</ref> Hart uploads various videos about her traveling experience on her second YouTube channel, YourHarto. The vlog (a recap of the city she is in) gets uploaded each Tuesday to her main channel, MyHarto. The kitchen episodes, which she films at a hosts house in the city she visits, are uploaded on Thursday, also to her main channel.
The team consists of four people; Hannah Hart (host), Pearl Wible (producer), Sam Molleur (director) and Nick Underwood (RV driver). The theme song for the tour, written by Hart, was accompanied by a video of fans jaunting in front of their favorite places. The song is called "Dont Wait To Say Hello".<ref>{{cite AV media url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPWZQTKzJsM title="Dont Wait to Say Hello" - music video publisher=YouTube work=MyHarto date=April 18, 2013 accessdate=June 23, 2015}}</ref>

After receiving negative feedback from a minority of fans that complained about the lack of places at the meet-ups, Hannah uploaded a video called The Real Hello Harto on her main channel, giving her fans an exclusive look behind the screens of a regular day on the Hello Harto tour. The video explained the work that goes into making content videos, as well shooting My Drunk Kitchen videos and meeting up with fans all over Canada and the United States.<ref>{{cite AV media url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1XRx1RvkvY title=The Real HELLO, HARTO publisher=YouTube work=MyHarto date=June 4, 2013 accessdate=June 23, 2015}}</ref>
