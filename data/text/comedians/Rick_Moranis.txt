Frederick Allan "Rick" Moranis (born April 18, 1953) is a Canadians Canadian actor, comedian, screenwriter, producer, musician, and songwriter. He is currently on film acting hiatus. He came to prominence in the sketch comedy series Second City Television (SCTV) in the 1980s and later appeared in several Hollywood films, including Strange Brew (1983), Ghostbusters (1984), Little Shop of Horrors (film) Little Shop of Horrors (1986), Spaceballs (1987), Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989, and its Honey, I Blew Up the Kid 1992 and Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves 1997 sequels), Parenthood (1989 film) Parenthood (1989), My Blue Heaven (1990 film) My Blue Heaven (1990), and The Flintstones (film) The Flintstones (1994).

In 1997, Moranis began a long hiatus from acting to dedicate his time to his 2 children as a widowed father.
He has not appeared in a live-action film since, although he has provided voice-over work for a few animated films, notably Walt Disney Animation Studios Disneys Brother Bear (2003). He has also released comedy albums and made appearances at fan conventions.

==Early life==
Moranis was born in Toronto, Ontario, to a Jews Jewish family.
He went to elementary school with Geddy Lee, frontman of the rock band Rush (band) Rush.
==Career==
His career as an entertainer began as a radio disc jockey in the mid-1970s, using the on-air name "Rick Allan" at three Toronto radio stations.
In 1977 he teamed up with Winnipeg-born writer/director and performer Ken Finkleman on a series of live performances on CBC Television CBCs 90 Minutes Live; comedy radio specials; and television comedy pilots, including one called Midweek and another called 1980 (produced at CBLA-FM CBC Toronto in 1979). Both pilots starred Finkleman and Moranis in a series of irreverent sketches including an early mockumentary sketch featuring Moranis as a Canadian movie producer, and another featuring the dubbed-in voiceovers of Nazi war criminals as they appear to be discussing their Hollywood agents and the money one can earn being interviewed on major documentary series like The World at War The World At War.

In 1980, Moranis was persuaded to join the third-season cast of Second City Television (SCTV) by friend and SCTV writer/performer Dave Thomas (actor) Dave Thomas.
At the time, Moranis was the only cast member not to have come from a The Second City Second City stage troupe. He is known for such impressions as Woody Allen, Merv Griffin and David Brinkley.{{citation needed date=October 2015}}

With SCTV moving to CBC in 1980 (and syndicated to the United States), Moranis and Thomas were challenged to fill two additional minutes with "identifiable Canadian content," and created a sketch called List of Bob &amp; Doug McKenzie appearances on SCTV The Great White North featuring the characters Bob and Doug McKenzie, a couple of Canadian buffoons. By the time NBC ordered 90-minute programs for the U.S. in 1981 (the fourth season of SCTV overall), there had been such favorable feedback from affiliates on the McKenzies that the network requested the duo have a sketch in every show.
Bob and Doug became a pop-culture phenomenon, which led to a top-selling and Grammy nominated album, The Great White North (album) Great White North,
and the 1983 movie Strange Brew, Moranis first major film role.

Another notable Moranis character on SCTV was Gerry Todd, a disc jockey who presented music clips on television. The sketch aired before the debut of MTV in the United States, leading both Sound &amp; Vision (magazine) Sound &amp; Vision and Martin Short to dub Moranis as the creator of the video jockey. "There had been no such thing" up until that point, recalled Short, so "the joke was that there would be such a thing."

After his SCTV work and the Strange Brew movie, Moranis had a busy career in feature films that lasted over a decade, most notably Ghostbusters; Spaceballs; Little Shop of Horrors (film) Little Shop of Horrors; and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and its sequels. He also did the voice-over for a short-lived cartoon Television program series on NBC called Gravedale High (1990).

In a 2004 interview, Moranis talked about his favorite kinds of films:
{{quote On the last couple of movies I made—big-budget Hollywood movies—I really missed being able to create my own material. In the early movies I did, I was brought in to basically rewrite my stuff, whether it was Ghostbusters or Spaceballs. By the time I got to the point where I was "starring" in movies, and I had executives telling me what lines to say, that wasnt for me. I’m really not an actor. Im a guy who comes out of comedy, and my impetus was always to rewrite the line to make it funnier, not to try to make somebody’s precious words work.
}}

Moranis last film roles were Barney Rubble in The Flintstones (film) The Flintstones (1994) and the box-office flop Big Bully (film) Big Bully (1996). Other than the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (franchise) Honey, I Shrunk the Kids sequels, by the mid-1990s his only appearance in that genre was a 1993 music video, Kamakiriad "Tomorrows Girls" by Donald Fagen, in which he played a man married to an extraterrestrial woman. Disneys final film in the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids franchise is 1997s direct-to-video film Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves, in which Moranis is the final remaining original cast member. The series Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show also launched in 1997 but without Moranis, then concluding in 2000. He worked for Disney twice more (with his fellow Second City Television SCTV alumnus Dave Thomas (actor) Dave Thomas), voicing Rutt the moose in the 2003 animated film Brother Bear and its Brother Bear 2 direct-to-video sequel.

Moranis was also slated to appear in The Breakfast Club, but was released by John Hughes (filmmaker) John Hughes because his interpretation of the role was not what Hughes was looking for.
In 2000, Moranis received his first film credit since 1997 when he provided voice work in the animated film, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys. In 2003, he provided his voice to the animated film Brother Bear.

{{As of 2004}}, Moranis was on the Advisory Committee for the Humber College Comedy: Writing and Performance comedy program at Humber College.
In 2005, Moranis released an album titled The Agoraphobic Cowboy, featuring Country music country songs with lyrics which Moranis says follow in the comic tradition of songwriters/singers such as Roger Miller, Kinky Friedman, and Jim Stafford. The album was produced by Tony Scherr and is distributed through ArtistShare, as well as Moraniss official web site. Commenting on the origins of the songs, he said that in 2003, "Out of the blue, I just wrote a bunch of songs. For lack of a better explanation, they’re more country than anything. And I actually demoed four or five of them, and Im not sure at this point what I’m going to do with them—whether I’m going to fold them into a full-length video or a movie. But, boy, I had a good time doing that."
On December 8, 2005, The Agoraphobic Cowboy was announced as a nominee for the 2006 Grammy for Best Comedy Album. On February 3, 2006, Moranis performed "Press Pound" on Late Night with Conan OBrien and discussed the development of his music career.

In 2006, Moranis reprised his role in the animated film Brother Bear 2.

In November 2007, Moranis reunited with Dave Thomas (actor) Dave Thomas for a 24th anniversary special of Bob and Doug McKenzie, titled Bob and Doug McKenzies 2–4 Anniversary. The duo shot new footage for this special. Thomas subsequently created a new animated Bob and Doug McKenzie series, Bob &amp; Doug (2009 TV series) Bob &amp; Doug, for his company Animax Entertainment. Moranis declined to voice the role of Bob, which was taken over by Dave Coulier, but remained involved in the series as an executive producer.
In May 2013, Moranis announced that he would release a brand new comedy album titled My Mothers Brisket &amp; Other Love Songs, his first album in eight years. The album was released on June 18, 2013.
Moranis said of the release "When I first began writing jokes and sketches with various Jewish partners one of us would inevitably stop at some point and announce, "Too Jewish!" Too Jewish for the star, the show, the network, or the audience. The songs on this album are all in that category. I grew up hearing the Allan Sherman and the You Dont Have To Be Jewish albums in the 60s. Now I am in my 60s."
In June 2013, Moranis gave an interview where he talked about reprising his role as Louis Tully in a third Ghostbusters film and his disappointment with the sequel. Moranis said "I havent talked to Dan Aykroyd about it. Somebody hes associated with called me and I said, I wouldnt not do it, but its got to be good. You know, Im not interested in doing anything Ive already done, and I thought the second one was a disappointment. But I guess Im interested in where that guy is now. I sort of see him as being Bernie Madoffs cellmate in jail. Both of them being so orderly that they race to get up and make their beds."
In 2015, regarding an offer for a brief appearance in the film, he concluded: "[Ghostbusters] didnt appeal to me. ... I wish them well. ... I hope its terrific. But it just makes no sense to me. Why would I do just one day of shooting on something I did 30 years ago?"
=== {{anchor LeavingActing}} Acting hiatus===
In 1997, Moranis took a hiatus from working in the film industry. He later explained: "Im a single parent and I just found that it was too difficult to manage to raise my kids and to do the traveling involved in making movies. So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didnt miss it."
After having declined an invitation to do a cameo appearance in 2016s Ghostbusters Ghostbusters (2016 film) reboot, Moranis clarified in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that he had not, in fact, retired from film acting due to his hiatus, but instead had become selective about future roles.
In July 2017, Moranis and Dave Thomas (actor) Dave Thomas reprised their Bob &amp; Doug characters at a benefit concert in Toronto. Proceeds from the benefit will go toward caring for Jake Thomas, Dave Thomas nephew, who suffered a spinal cord injury that has left him paralyzed from the waist down.
In May 2018, Moranis was announced to return as the character Dark Helmet in an episode of The Goldbergs (2013 TV series) The Goldbergs albeit as a voice.
Also announced in May 2018, Moranis will join the Martin Scorsese  directed Second City TV (SCTV) reunion documentary premiering on Netflix in 2019.
==Personal life==
Moranis married costume designer Ann Belsky in 1986; together they had two children, Rachel and Mitchell. Belsky died of cancer in February 1991. Moranis then slowly left public life to become a full-time single father.
