Packer is an obnoxious, alcoholic best friend of Michael Scott (The Office) Carells character. Koechner guest-starred, both in person and voice, on fifteen episodes of the series. His frequent work with actors Ferrell, Carell, Jack Black, and Ben Stiller have led some critics and journalists to point out his association with the media-dubbed "Frat Pack". David had a guest starring role as Uncle Earl in an episode on Hannah Montana.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-08-11-steve-carell_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA Carell just wants some love], August 11, 2005</ref><ref>[https://www.usatoday.com Profile], usatoday.com; accessed November 17, 2014.</ref><ref>[http://www.joblo.com/index.php?id=10340 Talladega trailer], joblo.com, February 13, 2006.</ref>

===2007&ndash;present===
In 2007, Koechner was seen in his first leading role in The Comebacks (which opened on October 19), the first comedy to be released under Fox Searchlights Fox Atomic division.<ref>Snyder, Gabriel; Laporte, Nicole.

He described this career opportunity as the "first lead for the right-hander."<ref name="SG"/> Veteran actor Carl Weathers played Koechners rival coach. Though Koechner, who usually writes and improvises his material, had no involvement with the screenplay, he complimented director Tom Brady (film director) Tom Brady for taking "great care to make it as smart as he could", adding that it is a sports comedy rather than a spoof.<ref name="SG"/>

On January 17, 2007, Comedy Central premiered The Naked Trucker and T-Bones Show, a sketch comedy series starring Koechner (as T-Bones) and longtime performing partner Dave "Gruber" Allen (as The Naked Trucker). The duo performs their unique brand of off-color songs and introduces pre-taped skits. Many of Koechners past co-stars made Cameo appearance cameos, including Will Ferrell, Jack Black, Steve Carell, Andy Richter, Dax Shepard, and Paul Rudd. The pre-taped skits gave Koechner more screen time than Allen, often letting him showcase his comedic charisma alongside guest stars like Richter and Shepard. Comedy Central  ordered eight episodes.<ref>[http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/naked_trucker/press_releases/naked_trucker_press_release.jhtml Comedy Central Announces The Series Pick-Up Of The Torrid, Twisted Tales Of "The Naked Trucker And T-Bones Show"]; Comedy Central, March 27, 2006.</ref>
