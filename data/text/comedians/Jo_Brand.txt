==Early life==
Brand was born in Hastings, East Sussex.
Her mother was a social worker and her father was a structural engineer. Brand is the middle of three children, with two brothers.
When she was about four, the family moved to the village of St Marys Platt near Sevenoaks in Kent,
and a year later, to Benenden.

After working in a pub, for Barnardos and as a nursing assistant in a residential unit for adults with learning disabilities she took a joint social science degree with a Nursing in the United Kingdom Registered Mental Nurse qualification at Brunel University. She then worked as a psychiatric nurse for ten years, at the Bethlem Royal Hospital South London Bethlem, Cefn Coed Hospital in Swansea and Maudsley Hospital in south London.
==Career==
===Comedy===
Brand was persuaded by agent Malcolm Hardee to begin a career in stand-up comedy, where she acquired the stage name the "Sea Monster". She was part of the British alternative comedy movement, working in London alternative comedy clubs in the mid-1980s, and appearing initially on the Saturday Live (UK TV series) Saturday Live television show. She shared a flat with fellow comic and comedy club owner Ivor Dembina.
During her first gig, she faced "an audience from hell" and, waiting to perform last, drank seven pints of lager. She thus faced her first live audience with a bursting bladder. As Brand ascended the stage, a male heckler started shouting, "Fuck off, you fat cow" and kept up the abuse until her performance finished. There was no applause at the end of her act.
Brands early style involved her delivering jokes in a bored monotone, one line at a time, with pauses in between. It drew heavily from pop culture and the media, with many jokes containing references to well-known celebrities and public figures. With her Doc Marten boots, her large size, and her short hair, her image remained the same for most of the 1980s and 1990s. Her appearance and material led to false rumours that she was a lesbian.
