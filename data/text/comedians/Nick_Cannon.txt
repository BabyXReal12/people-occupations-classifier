==Feud with Eminem==

Eminem responded with a mixtape-style track called "The Warning (Eminem song) The Warning" in which he addressed both Cannon and Mariah, and later commented that he was finished talking about the subject.

The feud was thought to have been over until in September 2010 when Cannon responded with the song "Im a Slick Rick", in which he takes shots at Eminem in Slick Ricks flow over the instrumental for Cali Swag Districts "Teach Me How to Dougie".<ref>{{cite web last=Kuperstein  first=Slava  url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.12204/title.nick-cannon-releases-eminem-diss-track  title=Nick Cannon Releases Eminem Diss Track publisher=HipHopDX  date=September 13, 2010  accessdate=October 26, 2010}}</ref> This was followed by a campaign via Facebook, Twitter, and his radio show proposing a boxing ring fight between Eminem and Cannon for charity.

In late September 2011, over a year after "Im a Slick Rick" was released, Cannon took another lyrical jab at Eminem by releasing a song called "I Remember".<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.kovideo.net/nick-cannon-releases-new-song-called-i-remember-news-nick-cannon-4166.html  title=Nick Cannon Releases New Song Called "I Remember"  publisher=Kovideo.net  date=September 27, 2011  accessdate=November 25, 2011  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120903143619/http://www.kovideo.net/nick-cannon-releases-new-song-called-i-remember-news-nick-cannon-4166.html  archivedate=September 3, 2012  df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web author=OFFICIALjoefosho17  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLGdtRUO2dc  title=Nick Cannon – I Remember  publisher=YouTube  date=September 27, 2011  accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref>

On October 3, 2011, Cannon released another song called "Warning (Remix)" featuring Uncle Murda, aimed at Eminem, radio host Charlamagne Tha God, and the feud between R&B singer Ray J and rapper Fabolous. The song features Cannon firing lyrical shots at Eminem and an audio clip of Eminem with Tim Westwood back in 2009 where Eminem saying: "I had no idea Nick Cannon was going to start wiling out on me," referring to Cannons then canceled Wild n Out television show. Cannon retorted to the clip by saying: "You said it Marshall, thats all you had to do!" and that Slim Shady is "forgiven."<ref name="youtube1">{{cite web author=nickcannon  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNaGG2zGSsE&feature=player_embedded  title=NickCannon.com Exclusive: "Warning" Remix  publisher=YouTube  date=  accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref><ref name="hiphopwired1">{{cite web author=&raquo; by Danielle Canada October 4, 2011, 8:07am  url=http://hiphopwired.com/2011/10/04/nick-cannon-disses-charlamagne-tha-god-on-new-track-warning-audio/  title=Nick Cannon Disses Charlamagne Tha God On New Track "Warning " (Audio)  publisher=Hiphopwired.com  date=October 4, 2011  accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web last=Langhorne  first=Cyrus  url=http://www.sohh.com/2011/10/nick_cannon_fires_warning_shot_charlamag.html  title=Nick Cannon Fires "Warning" Shot, Charlamagne Tha God Responds (Audio)  publisher=Sohh.Com  date=October 4, 2011  accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref><ref name="taletela1">{{cite web  author=Popular right now:  url=http://www.taletela.com/news/9978/nick-cannon-fires-back-at-eminem-&-disses-ray-jfabolous-beef-in-uncle-murda-remix-track  title=Nick Cannon Fires Back At Eminem & Disses Ray J/Fabolous Beef In Uncle Murda Remix Track  publisher=TaleTela  date=October 4, 2011  accessdate=November 25, 2011  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130204000200/http://www.taletela.com/news/9978/nick-cannon-fires-back-at-eminem-&-disses-ray-jfabolous-beef-in-uncle-murda-remix-track  archivedate=February 4, 2013  df=mdy-all }}</ref>

On June 2, 2016, Cannon had an interview with Tim Westwood. Westwood said, "Last time I saw you, you were getting ready to battle Eminem." Cannon responded, "Im still ready! Im trying to find him. Where is he? ... We gonna be out in the States for the BET Awards. Im holding a $100,000 battle — whoever wants it — but it has to be someone who can put up 100 grand ... I done reached out to Tyga, he didnt want it. I went to all Slaughterhouse (hip hop group) Slaughterhouse. I did it like Mortal Kombat, I said Ill take all of them out to get to the boss." Throughout the interview, Westwood goads Cannon along, saying, "Nick, youre the best fam. I dont think youd win against Eminem, but you are the best in many other ways." Cannon plays along with everything and says, "At least tell him to show up to the match. I cant win by default."<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIdW7Faipf4 title=Nick Cannon on battling Eminem for 100k - Westwood first= last=TimWestwoodTV date=June 2, 2016 publisher= via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.39077/title.nick-cannon-calls-out-eminem-for-100k-battle title=Nick Cannon Calls Out Eminem For $100K Battle first=HipHopDX - last=http://hiphopdx.com publisher=}}</ref>

On June 16, 2016, Cannon pours out his heart in a track titled "Divorce Papers." He recently refused to sign divorce papers with his ex-wife Mariah Carey. He also mentioned his father passing away. Cannon used some lines in the track as a response for the hate comments he had from Eminems fans, who are known as "Stans". He mentions Eminem in a few lines. He said that he can relate to the drug life Eminem had. "Em, right now I could really relate to him. Drug habits, all the pain that he was in." The last thing he mentioned in the track, he talks about himself finally signing the divorce papers. "Its been over two years and Im the one thats been waitin. Its fucked up that the time that you spend with your own kids is called visitation? Man, fuck it, lets sign these papers."<ref>{{cite web url=http://hiphopdx.com/singles/id.34064/title.nick-cannon-pours-his-heart-on-divorce-papers title=Nick Cannon Pours His Heart On "Divorce Papers" first=HipHopDX - last=http://hiphopdx.com publisher=}}</ref>
