Richard "Red" Skelton (July 18, 1913{{spaced ndash}}September 17, 1997) was an American comedian comedy entertainer. He was best known for his national old-time radio radio and television acts between 1937 and 1971, and as host of the television program The Red Skelton Show. He has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio and television, and also appeared in burlesque, vaudeville, films, nightclubs, and casinos, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist.

Skelton began developing his comedic and pantomime skills from the age of 10, when he became part of a traveling medicine show. He then spent time on a showboat, worked the burlesque circuit, and then entered into vaudeville in 1934. The "Doughnut Dunkers" pantomime sketch, which he wrote together with his wife, launched a career for him in vaudeville, radio, and films. His radio career began in 1937 with a guest appearance on The Fleischmanns Yeast Hour, which led to his becoming the host of Avalon Time in 1938. He became the host of The Raleigh Cigarette Program in 1941, on which many of his comedy characters were created, and he had a regularly scheduled radio program until 1957. Skelton made his film debut in 1938 alongside Ginger Rogers and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in Alfred Santells Having Wonderful Time, and he went on to appear in numerous musical and comedy films throughout the 1940s and early 1950s, with starring roles in Ship Ahoy (1941), I Dood It (1943), Ziegfeld Follies (film) Ziegfeld Follies (1946), and The Clown (1953 film) The Clown (1953).

Skelton was most eager to work in television, even when the medium was in its infancy. The Red Skelton Show made its television premiere on September 30, 1951, on NBC. By 1954, Skeltons program moved to CBS, where it was expanded to one hour and renamed The Red Skelton Hour in 1962. Despite high ratings, the show was cancelled by CBS in 1970, as the network believed that more youth-oriented programs were needed to attract younger viewers and their spending power. Skelton moved his program to NBC, where he completed his last year with a regularly scheduled television show in 1971. He spent his time after that making as many as 125 personal appearances a year and working on his art.

Skeltons artwork of clowns remained a hobby until 1964 when his wife Georgia persuaded him to have a showing at the Sands Hotel and Casino Sands Hotel in Las Vegas while he was performing there. Sales of his originals were successful, and he also sold prints and lithographs of them, earning $2.5 million yearly on lithograph sales. At the time of his death, his art dealer believed that Skelton had earned more money through his paintings than from his television work.

Skelton believed that his lifes work was to make people laugh; he wanted to be known as a clown because he defined it as being able to do everything. He had a 70-year career as a performer and entertained three generations of Americans. His widow donated many of his personal and professional effects to Vincennes University, including prints of his artwork. They are part of the Red Skelton Museum of American Comedy at Vincennes.

==Biography==

===Early years, the medicine show and the circus (1913–1929)===
Born Richard Bernard Eheart{{sfn Hyatt 2004 p=6}} on July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Indiana, Skelton was the fourth and youngest son of Ida Mae (née Fields) and Joseph Elmer Skelton. Joseph, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; he had once been a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus.<ref name=NYTObit>{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/arts/red-skelton-knockabout-comic-and-clown-prince-of-the-airwaves-is-dead-at-84.html?src=pm  title=Red Skelton, Knockabout Comic and Clown Prince of the Airwaves, Is Dead at 84  author=Severo, Richard  date=September 18, 1997  work=The New York Times  accessdate=May 18, 2011  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210010127/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/arts/red-skelton-knockabout-comic-and-clown-prince-of-the-airwaves-is-dead-at-84.html?src=pm  archivedate=February 10, 2013  df= }}</ref><ref name=Obit>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F_RLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2u0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6805,971926&dq=red+skelton&hl=en title=Lovable Clown Red Skelton Dies date=September 18, 1997 page=A9 work=The Deseret News accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref> His birth certificate surname was that of his fathers stepfather. During Skeltons lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, Skelton may have claimed he was older than he actually was in order to gain employment.{{sfn Hyatt 2004 p=6}}{{efn Skeltons birth certificate lists him as Richard Bernard Eheart. The Eheart surname comes from Josephs stepfather, and it appears that Joseph also used his stepfathers surname at times.{{sfn Hyatt 2004 p=6}} In a 1983 appearance on The Tonight Show, Skelton said his middle name was really "Red" and he had made up the middle name Bernard to satisfy a schoolteacher who would not believe his middle name was really "Red", although this story he presented in the comedy interview appearance does not match the reported content of his birth certificate.

When the man asked Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger turned out to be one of the shows stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.{{sfn Gehring 2008 p=22}}<ref name=Obit/><ref name=Carl/>{{efn Skelton also told another version of this actor and young newsboy story, with Raymond Hitchcock (actor) Raymond Hitchcock as the actor.<ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PFobAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-kwEAAAAIBAJ&dq=red-skelton%20raymond-hitchcock&pg=1520%2C5274344 title=I Dare Say! author=Parry, Florence Fisher date=September 14, 1946 work= The Pittsburgh Press page=2 accessdate=June 15, 2011}}</ref>}}

Skelton discovered at an early age that he could make people laugh. Skelton dropped out of school around 1926 or 1927, when he was 13 or 14 years old, but he already had some experience performing in Minstrel shows minstrel shows in Vincennes, and on a showboat, The Cotton Blossom, that plied the Ohio River Ohio and Missouri River Missouri rivers.<ref name=NYTObit/>{{sfn Gehring 2008 p=26}} He enjoyed his work on the riverboat, moving on only after he realized that showboat entertainment was coming to an end.<ref name=LAobit>{{cite news url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/18/news/mn-33654  title=Red Skelton, TV and Films Quintessential Clown, Dies  work=Los Angeles Times  date=September 18, 1997  accessdate=March 27, 2014  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220063712/http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/18/news/mn-33654  archivedate=December 20, 2014  df= }}</ref> Skelton, who was interested in all forms of acting, took a dramatic role with the John Lawrence Summer stock theatre stock theater company, but was unable to deliver his lines in a serious manner; the audience laughed instead.

Ida Skelton, who held multiple jobs to support her family after the death of her husband, did not suggest that her youngest son had run away from home to become an entertainer, but "his destiny had caught up with him at an early age". She let him go with her blessing. Times were tough during the Great Depression, and it may have meant one less child for her to feed.<ref name=Obit/>{{sfn Gehring 2008 p=8}} Around 1929, while Skelton was still a teen, he joined "Doc" R.E. Lewiss traveling medicine show as an errand boy who sold bottles of medicine to the audience. During one show, when Skelton accidentally fell from the stage, breaking several bottles of medicine as he fell, people laughed. Both Lewis and Skelton realized one could earn a living with this ability and the fall was worked into the show. He also told jokes and sang in the medicine show during his four years there.{{sfn Gehring 2008 pp=44–45}} Skelton earned ten dollars a week, and sent all of it home to his mother. When she worried that he was keeping nothing for his own needs, Skelton reassured her: "We get plenty to eat, and we sleep in the wagon."<ref name=saga>{{cite book url=https://archive.org/stream/ra00mac#page/n435/mode/2up  title=The Skelton Saga  author=Swanson, Pauline  work=Radio-TV Mirror  date=April 1949  pages=56–60, 93–99  accessdate=March 25, 2014  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108005234/http://archive.org/stream/ra00mac  archivedate=November 8, 2013  df= }}</ref>

Skelton asked Edna to collect empty cigarette packs; she thought he was joking, but did as he asked.  He then spent their fifty cents on bars of soap, which they cut into small cubes and wrapped with the tinfoil from the cigarette packs.  By selling their products for fifty cents each as fog remover for eyeglasses, the Skeltons were able to afford a hotel room every night as they worked their way to Harwich Port.<ref name=saga/>

Skelton and Edna worked for a year in Camden, New Jersey, and were able to get an engagement at Montreals Lido Club in 1934 through a friend who managed the chorus lines at New Yorks Roxy Theatre (New York City) Roxy Theatre.<ref name=saga/> Despite an initial rocky start, the act was a success, and brought them more theater dates throughout Canada.<ref name=LAobit/>{{efn Since much of Skeltons success had been in Canada at this point, many reviewers believed he was Canadian, calling him "a Canadian lad".{{sfn Gehring 2008 p=66}}}}

Skeltons performances in Canada led to new opportunities and the inspiration for a new, innovative routine that brought him recognition in the years to come. While performing in Montreal, the Skeltons met Harry Anger, a  vaudeville producer for New York Citys Loews State Theatre (New York City) Loews State Theatre. Anger promised the pair a booking as a headlining act at Loews, but they would need to come up with new material for the engagement. While the Skeltons were having breakfast in a Montreal diner, Edna had an idea for a new routine as she and Skelton observed the other patrons eating doughnuts and drinking coffee. They devised the "Doughnut Dunkers" routine, with Skeltons visual impressions of how different people ate doughnuts.{{efn Skelton copyrighted the original "Doughnut Dunkers" routine and every possible variation of it.<ref name=millionaire/>}}  The skit won them the Loews State engagement and a handsome fee.<ref name=Franchey/>{{sfn Adir 2001 p=197}}

The couple viewed the Loews State engagement in 1937 as Skeltons big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare material for the engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the "Doughnut Dunkers" and his older routines.<ref name=LAobit/>{{efn The problem with doing the "Doughnut Dunkers" skit was that Skelton had to eat nine doughnuts at every performance. He was performing five times a day and eating 45 doughnuts. He gained nearly 35 pounds, and had to shelve the routine until he lost some weight.<ref name=Franchey>{{cite book url=https://archive.org/stream/radiotelevis00macf#page/8/mode/2up  title=Everythings Funny But Love  author=Franchey, John R.  work=Radio-Television Mirror  date=June 1942  pages=8, 9, 46  accessdate=March 25, 2014  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108002947/http://archive.org/stream/radiotelevis00macf  archivedate=November 8, 2013  df= }}</ref>{{sfn Adir 2001 p=197}}}} The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited Skelton to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelts glass, saying, "Careful what you drink, Mr. President.  I got rolled in a place like this once." His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelts official birthday celebration for many years afterward.<ref name=laugh/>

===Radio, divorce and remarriage (1937–1951)===
Performing the "Doughnut Dunkers" routine led to Skeltons first appearance on Rudy Vallées The Fleischmanns Yeast Hour on August 12, 1937.

Vallée also booked veteran comic and fellow Indiana native Joe Cook (actor) Joe Cook to appear as a guest with Skelton.  The two Hoosiers proceeded to trade jokes about their home towns, with Skelton contending to Cook, an Evansville, Indiana Evansville native, that the city was a suburb of Vincennes. The show received enough fan mail after the performance to invite both comedians back two weeks after Skeltons initial appearance and again in November of that year.{{sfn Gehring 2008 pp=72-77}}

Skelton also added a routine he had been performing since 1928. Originally called "Mellow Cigars", the skit entailed an announcer who became ill as he smoked his sponsors product.

Skelton served in the United States Army during World War II.  After being assigned to the Special Services, Skelton performed as many as ten to twelve shows per day before troops in both the United States and in Europe. The pressure of his workload caused him to suffer Fatigue (medical) exhaustion and a Mental breakdown nervous breakdown.<ref name=NYTObit/><ref name=release/> His nervous collapse while in the army left him with a serious stuttering problem.  While recovering at an army hospital at Fort Pickett Camp Pickett, Virginia, he met a soldier who had been severely wounded and was not expected to survive.  Skelton devoted a lot of time and effort to trying to make the man laugh.  As a result of this effort, his stuttering problem was cured; his army friends condition also improved and he was no longer on the critical list.<ref>{{cite book url=https://archive.org/stream/radiotvmirror00macf#page/n485/mode/2up  title=Laughter For Peter  date=May 1952  work=Radio-TV Mirror  pages=41, 84  accessdate=March 25, 2014  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108002855/http://archive.org/stream/radiotvmirror00macf  archivedate=November 8, 2013  df= }}</ref> He was Military discharge released from his army duties in September 1945.<ref name=release/>{{sfn Adir 2001 p=201}}  "Ive been told Im the only celebrity who entered the Army as a private and came out a private," he told reporters.<ref>Associated Press, "Comedian Out of Army With Rank Unchanged", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Sunday 30 September 1945, Volume 52, page 6.</ref>  His sponsor was eager to have him back on the air, and Skeltons program began anew on NBC on December 4, 1945.{{sfn Hyatt 2004 p=13}}<ref>{{cite journal url=https://books.google.com/?id=qhEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT5 title=B&W Hopes That Red Skelton May Be Ex-GI By Fall date=May 5, 1945 journal=Billboard  page=6 accessdate=May 22, 2011  issn=0006-2510 author1=Nielsen Business Media first1=Inc}}</ref>

Upon returning to radio, Skelton brought with him many new characters that were added to his repertoire: Bolivar Shagnasty, described as a "loudmouthed braggart"; Cauliflower McPugg, a boxer; Deadeye, a cowboy; Willie Lump-Lump, a fellow who drank too much; and San Fernando Red, a conman with political aspirations.{{sfn Hyatt 2004 p=14}} By 1947, Skeltons musical conductor was David Rose (songwriter) David Rose, who would go on to television with him; he had worked with Rose during his time in the army and wanted Rose to join him on the radio show when it went back on the air.{{sfn Hyatt 2004 pp=14-15}}

The script was completed and he had the shows production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls.  The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the characters wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking.  When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he realizes he is not lying on the floor but on the living room wall.

Skelton began producing artwork in 1943, but kept his works private for many years. He said he was inspired to try his hand at painting after visiting a large Chicago department store that had various paintings on display.

==Legacy and tributes==
Skelton preferred to be described as a clown rather than a comic: "A comedian goes out and hits people right on.  A clown uses pathos.  He can be funny, then turn right around and reach people and touch them with what life is like."<ref name=circusclown>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&dat=19740730&id=7AgvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wNoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2778,3650439 title=Red Skelton Kicked Off His Career With Circus date=July 30, 1974 work=Beaver County Times page=B5 accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> "I just want to be known as a clown", he said, "because to me thats the height of my profession.

In Groucho and Me, Groucho Marx called Skelton "the most unacclaimed clown in show business", and "the logical successor to Charlie Chaplin [Charlie] Chaplin", largely because of his ability to play a multitude of characters with minimal use of dialogue and props. "With one prop, a soft battered hat", Groucho wrote, describing a performance he had witnessed, "he successfully converted himself into an idiot boy, a peevish old lady, a teetering-tottering drunk, an overstuffed clubwoman, a tramp, and any other character that seemed to suit his fancy. No grotesque make-up, no funny clothes, just Red." He added that Skelton also "plays a dramatic scene about as effectively as any of the dramatic actors."{{sfn Gehring 2008 p=xv}}{{sfn Marx 1959 pp=136-137}} In late 1965 ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, reminiscing about the entertainment business, singled out Skelton for high praise. "Its all so very different today. The whole business of comedy has changed — from 15 minutes of quality to quantity. We had a lot of very funny people around, from Charley Chase to Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. The last one of that breed is Red Skelton."<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newpapers%20Disk2/Utica%20NY%20Daily%20Observer/Utica%20NY%20Observer%201965%20pdf/Utica%20NY%20Observer%201965%20a%20-%204266.PDF#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&u=ffffffff8bdbc9e4&DocId=2183107&Index=Z%3a%5cIndex%20U%2dF%2dP&HitCount=6&hits=18+19+28+29+327+328+&SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&.pdf title=You Can Go Back to Allens Alley Sunday Night date=November 12, 1965 work=Utica Observer-Dispatch page=11 accessdate=October 30, 2013}} (PDF)</ref> Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures also praised Skelton, saying, "Hes a clown in the old tradition.

In 2006, Travis Tarrants purchased the historic Vincennes Pantheon Theatre, where Skelton performed during his youth. He established a non-profit organization with the hope of restoring the theatre to its 1921 state.<ref>{{cite web last=Twitty  first=Tiffany  title=1921 Pantheon Theatre will be part of downtown Vincennes future  url=http://www.indianaeconomicdigest.com/main.asp?Search=1&ArticleID=27016&SectionID=31&SubSectionID=195&S=1  work=Indiana Economic Digest  publisher=IBRC and IAR  accessdate=6 May 2011  date=18 May 2006  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320190745/http://www.indianaeconomicdigest.com/main.asp?Search=1&ArticleID=27016&SectionID=31&SubSectionID=195&S=1  archivedate=20 March 2012  df= }}</ref> Tarrants was able to raise close to $300,000 for the restoration. Two years later, donations for the project plummeted. Tarrants lost the theatre to unpaid back taxes in 2012 and the new owner was realtor Heath Klein.  In late 2014, Klein sold the theatre property to a Vincennes non-profit group, INVin.  The organization works to bring arts and arts-related businesses into downtown Vincennes.<ref>{{cite news url=http://indianaeconomicdigest.com/Main.asp?SectionID=31&SubSectionID=121&ArticleID=77658  title=Another chance for Vincennes Pantheon Theatre where Red Skelton first performed  author=McNeese, Jenny  date=December 24, 2014  publisher=Vincennes Sun-Commercial  accessdate=November 28, 2016  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231170333/http://indianaeconomicdigest.com/Main.asp?SectionID=31&SubSectionID=121&ArticleID=77658  archivedate=December 31, 2016  df= }}</ref> In March 2016, the group proposed to turn the theatre into shared workspace.<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160310/news/303109955/  title=Group sees 1919 Vincennes theater becoming shared work space  date=March 10, 2016  publisher=Vincennes Sun-Commercial  author=McNeese, Jenny  accessdate=November 28, 2016  deadurl=no  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231080940/http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160310/news/303109955/  archivedate=December 31, 2016  df= }}</ref>
