==Career==

After beginning her stand-up comedy in 1992, Silverman was part of the Saturday Night Live (season 19) 1993–94 season of Saturday Night Live (SNL) for 18 weeks as a writer and featured player. She was fired after one season where only one of the sketches she wrote survived to Rehearsal dress rehearsal and none aired, although she did appear on the show as a cast member in skits, usually in smaller supporting roles. Bob Odenkirk, a former SNL writer, explained, "I could see how it wouldnt work at SNL because shes got her own voice, shes very much Sarah Silverman all the time. She can play a character but she doesnt disappear into the character—she makes the character her."
She has stated that she was not ready for SNL when she got the job.
She said that when she was fired it hurt her confidence for a year, but after that nothing could hurt her and that she attributes her time to SNL as being a key reason why she has been so tough in her career.
Later, she was grateful that her SNL time was short because it didnt end up defining her.
She parodied the situation when she appeared on The Larry Sanders Show episode "The New Writer" (1996), playing Sanders new staff writer, whose jokes are not used because of the chauvinism and bias of the male chief comedy writer, who favors the jokes of his male co-writers.

In June 2007, she hosted the MTV Movie Awards. During her opening act, she commented on the upcoming jail sentence of Paris Hilton, who was in the audience, saying: "In a couple of days, Paris Hilton is going to jail. As a matter of fact, I heard that to make her feel more comfortable in prison, the guards are going to paint the bars to look like human penis penises. I think it is wrong, too. I just worry she is going to break her teeth on those things."
In September 2007, she appeared at the MTV Video Music Awards. Following the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards#Britney Spears performance comeback performance of Britney Spears, Silverman mocked her on stage, saying: "Wow, she is amazing.

According to the audio commentary on the Clerks II DVD, director Kevin Smith offered her the role that eventually went to Rosario Dawson, but she turned it down out of fear of being typecast in "girlfriend roles".

===2011–present: Take This Waltz and other projects===
File:Sarah Silverman performing at UCB.jpg thumb Silverman performing at Upright Citizens Brigade in Los Angeles, January 2013 Silverman played Geraldine alongside Michelle Williams (actress) Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen in Take This Waltz (film) Take This Waltz, written and directed by Sarah Polley. The film was well received when it premiered in Toronto in 2011
and was picked up by Magnolia for U.S. distribution in summer 2012.
At the Toronto International Film Festival, she told the press shed deliberately gained weight for the part, which required a nude scene, emphasizing that Polley wanted "real bodies and real women."
In interviews, she warned fans not to expect too much.
However, she later told podcaster and author Julie Klausner that she had not really gained weight for the role and that the statements were meant as self-deprecating humor.
On September 20, 2012, Silverman made a public service announcement (PSA) criticizing new voter identification laws that create obstacles to the ability of certain groups to vote in the November presidential election, i.e., young, old, poor, and minority citizens. The project was financed by the Jewish Council for Education &amp; Research (JCER) and was co-produced by Mik Moore
and Ari Wallach (the pair that also co-produced The Great Schlep and Scissor Sheldon).
Silverman voiced Vanellope von Schweetz, one of the main characters in the 2012 Disney animated film, Wreck-It Ralph. She is in the creative team that writes and produces the content for the YouTube comedy channel called Jash. The other partners are Michael Cera, Reggie Watts, and Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim (also known as Tim &amp; Eric). The JASH channel premiered online March 10, 2013.

==Controversies==

===Media Action Network for Asian Americans incident===
File:Sarah Silverman (7588066284).jpg left thumb Silverman at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International
In a July 2001 interview on NBCs Late Night with Conan OBrien, Silverman used the ethnic slur "chink" in explaining that a friend advised her to avoid jury duty by writing a racial slur on the selection form, "something inappropriate, like I hate chinks." Silverman said she decided that she did not want to be thought of as a racist, so "I wrote I love chinks – and who doesnt?"
Silverman said the joke satirizes the racist thought process. Guy Aoki of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) objected to her use of the slur.
NBC and OBrien apologized, but Silverman did not. Later, appearing on Politically Incorrect in July and August 2001, Silverman questioned Aokis sincerity, accusing him of exploiting the opportunity for publicity. On a later episode, Aoki appeared with Silverman and stated he did not accept Silvermans explanation, saying that it was not successful satire and that comedians should consult groups such as his before performing such material. She stated in an
<!-- National Public Radio  -->
NPR Fresh Air interview that she was asked to repeat the joke on Politically Incorrect, among other places, but eventually dropped it from her act because she felt it was becoming stale.
Silverman has since turned the complaint into grist for her standup act, saying that the experience helped teach her the important lesson that racism is bad: "And I mean bad, like in that black way."
===The Aristocrats===
A minor controversy arose over Silvermans performance in the documentary film The Aristocrats (film) The Aristocrats (2005). The film shows her doing the The Aristocrats Aristocrats joke – a sample of transgressive art told by numerous comedians since the vaudeville era – like it was an autobiographical account of her life as a Child pornography child sex performer.  As part of the routine, she mentions that Joe Franklin, a New York radio and TV personality whose nostalgic programs aired from the early 1950s until shortly before his death in 2015, would ask her to perform privately for him in his apartment. Silverman looks at the camera and, in a deadpan voice, accuses Franklin of raping her. The film was edited in such a way that it appears as if Franklin knows what Silverman said about him. Later, after her clip, Franklin is shown stating, "Sarah Silverman is a young lady to watch." After the film came out, Franklin took offense at Silvermans using his name in the routine and considered suing her. A month later, The New York Times noted he remained undecided but had said, "The best thing I could do is get Sarah better writers so shed have funnier material."
==Personal life==
Silverman became a vegetarian at the age of ten.
She is open about her lifelong battle with Major depressive disorder clinical depression, which at one point led to her developing an addiction to Alprazolam Xanax. She credited her subsequent emotional health to taking the prescription drug Sertraline Zoloft.
She struggled with Nocturnal enuresis bedwetting from the time she was young until well into her teens and stated in a 2007 interview that she had wet the bed recently.
Silvermans autobiography, published in April 2010, entitled The Bedwetter, explores the subject of bed wetting, among other subjects. She stated she did not want to get married until Same-sex marriage in the United States same-sex couples were able to.
In 2014, she tweeted "Just read that I wanna get married which is hilarious b/c I will never get married," adding, "Why would I want the govt involved in my love life? Ew. Its barbaric."
She stated she does not want to have biological children because "theres just millions of kids that have no parents" in the world and to avoid the risk that they might inherit her depression.
In 2017, Silverman also said that she has prioritized her artistic career, constantly on tour, instead of motherhood.
Silvermans biological sister, Laura Silverman Laura, played her sister on The Sarah Silverman Program. An older sister, Susan Silverman Susan, is a rabbi who lives in Jerusalem with her husband, Yosef Abramowitz, the co-founder and president of Arava Power Company, and their five children.
Silverman considers herself culturally Jewish, which she has frequently mined for material, but says she is agnostic
and does not follow Judaism, claiming, "I have no religion. But culturally I cant escape it; Im very Jewish."
Silverman dated comedian and fellow SNL writer Dave Attell.
Silverman began dating Jimmy Kimmel in 2002.
She referred to the relationship in some of her comedy, joking: "Im Jewish, but I wear this Saint Christopher medal sometimes; my boyfriend is Catholic – but you know ... it was cute the way he gave it to me. He said if it doesnt burn a hole through my skin, it will protect me."
In July 2008, Vanity Fair (magazine) Vanity Fair reported that the couple had split. However, in October 2008, the media reported they were on "the road back to being together".
The couple attended the wedding of Howard Stern and Beth Ostrosky Stern Beth Ostrosky,
but split again in March 2009.
At the Emmy Awards in August 2014, Silverman acknowledged she and Welsh actor Michael Sheen were in a relationship.
Silverman said in February 2018 that the two had broken up over the holidays.
In July 2016, Silverman spent a week in the intensive care unit at Cedars Sinai Hospital with epiglottitis.
==Politics and activism==
File:Sarah Silverman Introduces Bernie Sanders in L.A..webm thumb Silverman introduces Bernie Sanders at an August 2015 Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016 campaign rally in Los Angeles
In 2015, she signed an open letter which the ONE Campaign had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women, as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in Ethiopia, respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.
In 2015, Silverman endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States, saying, "He says what he means &amp; he means what he says &amp; hes not for sale." She had previously introduced Sanders at a rally in Los Angeles, California that drew an audience of over 27,500 people.
Silverman spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in support of Hillary Clinton. She urged other Sanders supporters to back Clinton and later, amid some boos from some Sanders supporters, said, "Can I just say? To the Bernie or Bust people, youre being ridiculous."
The Washington Post and Politico called this one of the most memorable moments of the night.
The New York Times called her speech "the perfect breath of fresh air."
Michael Grunwald of Politico coined the term "Silverman Democrats" for Sanders supporters who followed Silvermans advice to support Clinton in the presidential election.
