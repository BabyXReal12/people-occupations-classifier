Jack was born in Bromley, Kent,<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=X0W2nYTQziJ76AG%2BJ4teNQ&scan=1 title=Index entry accessdate=7 August 2016 work=FreeBMD publisher=ONS}}</ref> and grew up in nearby Petts Wood<ref name=comedycv>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/talent/d/dee_jack.shtml BBC Comedy Guide: Jack Dee]; accessed 14 August 2006.</ref> before moving with his family to Winchester when he was young. His father, Geoffrey, was a printer and his mother, Rosemary, was the daughter of two unsuccessful repertory actors, Henry Lionel Pope Stamper (1906–1985) and Edna May Howard Innes (1904–1969).<ref>Dee, Jack. Thanks For Nothing. Doubleday (publisher) Doubleday, 2009, pp. 133-34, 171.<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>

Dee was educated at both independent school (United Kingdom) independent and state schools. His first school, The Pilgrims School, a preparatory school in Winchester, was followed by the state Kings School Montgomery of Alamein School for his secondary education, and for a period he attended Frensham Heights School. He took his GCE Advanced Level A-levels at Peter Symonds College, and left with a D and an F grade. Following this, he planned to attend drama college, but his plans were scuppered when his mother persuaded him to get a vocation, and so he entered the catering industry and became a waiter.<ref>{{cite news first=Lucy last=Cavendish title=Now I dont need to be drunk to be happy url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/starinterviews/article-23371763-now-i-dont-need-to-be-drunk-to-be-happy.do archive-url=https://archive.is/20120525160640/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/starinterviews/article-23371763-now-i-dont-need-to-be-drunk-to-be-happy.do dead-url=yes archive-date=25 May 2012 newspaper=Evening Standard date=23 October 2006 accessdate=17 January 2007}}</ref>

==Career==
{{BLP sources section date=November 2016}}
Dees first public act was an open-mic gig in 1986 at The Comedy Store, London The Comedy Store, which he went to one evening after work.<ref>Different sources give different dates for the open-mike gig, with some saying 1986, some 1987 and some 1988. An interview with The Times in 2004 states 1987. [http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/j/159/jack_dee?PHPSESSID=336900134e6576a6a16c69f719cc93c8 Chortle] gives 1986 and 1988 on the same page. His biography at Off The Kerb, which represents him, gives it as 1986.</ref> He was encouraged to write additional material and to tour the circuit.

Since the 1990s he has performed sell-out acts at many high-profile venues (including the London Palladium and the Hammersmith Apollo). After he scooped the British Comedy Award for Best Stage Newcomer in 1991, Dee was offered his own show; The Jack Dee Show first went out on Channel 4 in February 1992, bringing him to a wider audience. His combination of stand-up routines on television continued with Jack Dees Saturday Night on ITV, Jack Dees Happy Hour in 1997 and later Live at the Apollo (TV series) Jack Dee Live at the Apollo in 2004 on BBC One.{{citation needed date=November 2016}}

In 1996, he starred alongside Jeremy Hardy in Jack and Jeremys Real Lives, a collection of mockumentaries similar to their previous collaboration, Jack And Jeremys Police 4. Each episode would focus on the pair playing bizarre characters from a particular profession. Shot on film and featuring no laugh track, the show failed to catch on. After three episodes it was moved to air after midnight. The pilot featured Sacha Baron Cohen being electrocuted. Aside from his successful stand-up career, Dee has played starring roles and guest appearances in television series. He played the part of Doug Digby in Pilot (The Grimleys) the Grimleys pilot (1997) before the role was recast for The Grimleys the series, and made guest appearances on such programmes as Silent Witness, Dalziel and Pascoe (TV series) Dalziel and Pascoe and Jonathan Creek.{{citation needed date=November 2016}}

In 2001, he won Celebrity Big Brother 1 (UK) Celebrity Big Brother (then linked to fundraising for Comic Relief). During evictions, he dressed up in a tweed jacket and cap and held his packed suitcase, hoping to be voted out. During the eviction of another housemate he briefly absconded to sneak a quick kiss with his wife. He also escaped for several hours at night-time. He has subsequently said that he dislikes the treatment of the housemates by the show and its producers, and has refused all permission for any of the clips to be shown again.<ref>{{cite video people=Jack Dee, Mark Lawson title=Mark Lawson Talks to Jack Dee medium=TV-series publisher=BBC Four date=3 October 2006}}</ref>

In 2004, he played the role of Steven Sharples Member of Parliament MP the self-styled Deputy Home Secretary alongside Warren Clarke and Dervla Kirwan in The Deputy. Dees performance was praised, though the film itself received a lukewarm response.<ref>{{cite news first=Kathryn last=Flett title=The ups and downs of pros and cons url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1158696,00.html work=The Observer date=29 February 2004 accessdate=14 August 2006 location=London, UK}}</ref> Later that year he starred in another one-off drama, Tunnel of Love. He was the celebrity advocate in Britains Best Sitcom for Fawlty Towers and presented an hour-long documentary about the series.{{citation needed date=November 2016}}

In 2005, he co-hosted Comic Aid, a one-off gathering of comedians that aimed to raise money for the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami Asian Tsunami Appeal.

His most recent series Lead Balloon, which he also co-wrote, began on BBC Four on 4 October 2006. Described as "Britains answer to Curb Your Enthusiasm",<ref>{{cite news first=Ciar last=Byrne title=Dee writes BBCs answer to "Curb Your Enthusiasm" url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article341031.ece work=The Independent date=26 January 2006 accessdate=14 August 2006 location=London, UK deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914041740/http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article341031.ece archivedate=14 September 2006 df=dmy-all}}</ref> Lead Balloon sees Dee play the semi-biographical role of Rick Spleen. A second series of eight episodes was commissioned and was broadcast on BBC Two in 2007, with a third series debuting on Thursday 13 November 2008.

In February 2009, it was announced that Dee would be one of a trio of hosts to replace the late Humphrey Lyttelton for the summer series of Im Sorry I Havent a Clue (the others being Stephen Fry and Rob Brydon).<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a147836/fry-brydon-dee-to-host-clue-return.html title=Fry, Brydon, Dee to host Clue return date=25 February 2009 publisher=digitalspy.co.uk}}</ref> He subsequently became the permanent host from the 52nd series onwards.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8311305.stm Jack Dee to host Radio 4s Clue], bbc.co.uk; accessed 5 November 2016.</ref> He is also a frequent guest on QI and Have I Got News for You, which he has guest-presented ten times, and he hosts segments of the BBCs biennial Comic Relief (charity) Comic Relief telethon.
