==Early life and education==
Jack Dee was the youngest of three children born to Rosemary A. (married and maiden names née Stamper) and Geoffrey T. Dee, after Joanna Innes Dee and David Simon Innes Dee. Jack was born in Bromley, Kent,
and grew up in nearby Petts Wood
before moving with his family to Winchester when he was young. His father, Geoffrey, was a printer and his mother, Rosemary, was the daughter of two unsuccessful repertory actors, Henry Lionel Pope Stamper (1906–1985) and Edna May Howard Innes (1904–1969).
Dee was educated at both independent school (United Kingdom) independent and state schools. His first school, The Pilgrims School, a preparatory school in Winchester, was followed by the state Kings School Montgomery of Alamein School for his secondary education, and for a period he attended Frensham Heights School. He took his GCE Advanced Level A-levels at Peter Symonds College, and left with a D and an F grade. Following this, he planned to attend drama college, but his plans were scuppered when his mother persuaded him to get a vocation, and so he entered the catering industry and became a waiter.
==Career==
{{BLP sources section date=November 2016}}
Dees first public act was an open-mic gig in 1986 at The Comedy Store, London The Comedy Store, which he went to one evening after work.
He was encouraged to write additional material and to tour the circuit.

Since the 1990s he has performed sell-out acts at many high-profile venues (including the London Palladium and the Hammersmith Apollo). After he scooped the British Comedy Award for Best Stage Newcomer in 1991, Dee was offered his own show; The Jack Dee Show first went out on Channel 4 in February 1992, bringing him to a wider audience. His combination of stand-up routines on television continued with Jack Dees Saturday Night on ITV, Jack Dees Happy Hour in 1997 and later Live at the Apollo (TV series) Jack Dee Live at the Apollo in 2004 on BBC One.{{citation needed date=November 2016}}

In 1996, he starred alongside Jeremy Hardy in Jack and Jeremys Real Lives, a collection of mockumentaries similar to their previous collaboration, Jack And Jeremys Police 4. Each episode would focus on the pair playing bizarre characters from a particular profession. Shot on film and featuring no laugh track, the show failed to catch on. After three episodes it was moved to air after midnight. The pilot featured Sacha Baron Cohen being electrocuted. Aside from his successful stand-up career, Dee has played starring roles and guest appearances in television series. He played the part of Doug Digby in Pilot (The Grimleys) the Grimleys pilot (1997) before the role was recast for The Grimleys the series, and made guest appearances on such programmes as Silent Witness, Dalziel and Pascoe (TV series) Dalziel and Pascoe and Jonathan Creek.{{citation needed date=November 2016}}

In 2001, he won Celebrity Big Brother 1 (UK) Celebrity Big Brother (then linked to fundraising for Comic Relief). During evictions, he dressed up in a tweed jacket and cap and held his packed suitcase, hoping to be voted out. During the eviction of another housemate he briefly absconded to sneak a quick kiss with his wife. He also escaped for several hours at night-time. He has subsequently said that he dislikes the treatment of the housemates by the show and its producers, and has refused all permission for any of the clips to be shown again.
In 2004, he played the role of Steven Sharples Member of Parliament MP the self-styled Deputy Home Secretary alongside Warren Clarke and Dervla Kirwan in The Deputy. Dees performance was praised, though the film itself received a lukewarm response.
Later that year he starred in another one-off drama, Tunnel of Love. He was the celebrity advocate in Britains Best Sitcom for Fawlty Towers and presented an hour-long documentary about the series.{{citation needed date=November 2016}}

In 2005, he co-hosted Comic Aid, a one-off gathering of comedians that aimed to raise money for the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami Asian Tsunami Appeal. In May of the same year he appeared on the "Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car (Top Gear) Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car" segment of the BBC Two series Top Gear (2002 TV series) Top Gear, achieving a lap time of 1:53.5 (52nd on the Suzuki Liana leader board). His most recent series Lead Balloon, which he also co-wrote, began on BBC Four on 4 October 2006. Described as "Britains answer to Curb Your Enthusiasm",
Lead Balloon sees Dee play the semi-biographical role of Rick Spleen. A second series of eight episodes was commissioned and was broadcast on BBC Two in 2007, with a third series debuting on Thursday 13 November 2008. A fourth series finished on the BBC on 5 July 2011.
He also starred as Harry in the 2005 film Short Order.

In February 2009, it was announced that Dee would be one of a trio of hosts to replace the late Humphrey Lyttelton for the summer series of Im Sorry I Havent a Clue (the others being Stephen Fry and Rob Brydon).
He subsequently became the permanent host from the 52nd series onwards.
He is also a frequent guest on QI and Have I Got News for You, which he has guest-presented ten times, and he hosts segments of the BBCs biennial Comic Relief (charity) Comic Relief telethon. He starred in advertisements for John Smiths Brewery John Smiths Bitter in the 1990s, becoming known as "the midget with the widget". He made his stage debut in 1998, playing Yvan in Yasmina Rezas Laurence Olivier Awards Olivier award-winning Art (play) Art. He later returned as Serge for a 13-week run at the request of the director.
In 2008, Dee took part in the 15th anniversary special of Shooting Stars (TV series) Shooting Stars where he replaced Will Self as captain of Team A. The show aired on 30 December 2008 on BBC2. Dee returned as team captain in series 6 of Shooting Stars on 26 August 2009, and again for the 7th series. Over Christmas 2009, Dee played the role of John Tweedledum in The News at Bedtime.{{cn date=June 2017}}

In 2010, Dee took part in Channel 4s Comedy Gala, a Benefit concert benefit show held in aid of Great Ormond Street Hospital Great Ormond Street Childrens Hospital, filmed live at the The O2 Arena (London) O2 Arena in London on 30 March. In 2013, Dee joined Dara Ó Briain, Chelsee Healey, Greg James, Mel C and Philips Idowu in Through Hell and High Water, a Comic Relief challenge which involved British celebrities canoeing the most difficult rapids of the Zambezi River. They raised more than £1 million for the charity.{{citation needed date=November 2016}}

==Personal life==
Dee met Susan Jane Hetherington in 1986, when he was working as a waiter in Fulham and she was a receptionist at a nearby hotel.
They married in Winchester (borough) Winchester, Hampshire, in 1989.
Together, they have four children.
Dee suffers from Major depressive disorder depression, and he has claimed that his work is the best therapy for his condition, saying "if you have the impulse to be creative, you ignore it at your peril".
In his twenties, Dee worked at The Ritz London Hotel the Ritz in London and started drinking heavily. He attended church and attempted to become a priest. After he realised that was not for him he gave it up, and never quit drinking, although he would later describe his condition as "alcohol abuse" rather than alcoholism, which was the diagnosis at the time.
Since the 1990s, he has advertised John Smiths Brewery John Smiths Bitter, becoming known as "the midget with the widget".
Following his appearance on Celebrity Big Brother, he had a relapse, though did not attend Alcoholics Anonymous AA meetings because he did not want paparazzi photographing him leaving the meetings.
In 2007, the Daily Express reported that he was in negotiations with publishers to release his autobiography.
He signed with Doubleday (publisher) Doubleday in 2008 and the book, Thanks For Nothing: The Jack Dee Memoirs, was released in October 2009, along with an audiobook of the same title which he narrates.
According to Dee, "its really the story of how I got into comedy... Its kind of an autobiography but isnt, as it stops about 25 years ago. It goes right up to the first time I do stand up."
In February 2009, Dee and several other entertainers wrote an open letter to The Times supporting Baháí leaders, then on trial in Iran.
Dee is also a director of Open Mike Productions, which he also co-founded with Addison Cresswell,
which produces shows for television and radio including Michael McIntyres Comedy Roadshow and Alan Carr: Chatty Man.
