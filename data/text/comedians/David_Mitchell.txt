From the age of thirteen, Mitchell was educated at Abingdon School, a Public school (United Kingdom) public school in Oxfordshire. Having always been top of the class at Primary school and Prep school, once he moved to Abingdon-on-Thames Abingdon, he realised that there were plenty of people more intelligent than he was, so he turned his attention to debating and drama, "where [he] had a chance of being the best".<ref name=timesinter/> There, Mitchell often took part in plays, "largely because you got to play cards backstage."<ref name=Independent/> His roles mainly consisted of small minute-long parts, until he won the role of Rabbit (Winnie-the-Pooh) Rabbit in Winnie-the-Pooh. This was the first time that he was "consciously aware I was doing a performance" and that that "was better, even, than playing cards."<ref name=Independent/> Mitchell had been "obsessed" with comedy writing since his school days, as he "always felt that doing a joke was the cleverest thing", and "would intrinsically prefer a parody of something to the actual thing itself".<ref name=inter>{{cite web last=Richman  first=Darren  url=http://www.wessexscene.co.uk/article.php?sid=1011  title=David peep show Mitchell Interview  date=7 March 2005  accessdate=17 March 2007  publisher=Wessex Scene  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004003828/http://www.wessexscene.co.uk/article.php?sid=1011  archivedate=4 October 2006  deadurl=yes  df=dmy }}</ref>

In a 2007 interview with Digital Spy, Mitchell stated that he enjoyed panel shows, as they are "a game worth playing".<ref name=ds/> He then further explained his appreciation of the panel format in response to criticism from Fast Show co-creator Charlie Higson, who stated in September 2013 that panel comedies were overtaking television programming at the expense of sketch shows and sitcoms:
{{bq text=
There was a quote from Catherine Zeta-Jones about playing golf with her husband Michael Douglas. We essentially all started to imagine the scene of the two of them playing golf and that was very enjoyable and turned into a really fun bit of TV. It is moments like that which, for me, justify the existence of panel shows because no-one would ever have written those words. It purely came out of that combination of people which proves panel shows can produce funny TV in a way you could never write into a sitcom or a sketch show and thereby justifies its place on screen. I think it is a great form of entertainment and we shouldnt lose sight of that.<ref name="Adam" />}}

The Radio Times named him "The Best Comedy Panel Show Guest" in the world, stating that "hes incredibly, disgustingly witty" and "even starting to make Paul Merton look slow on the uptake".<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/peep-show/the-best-comedy-panel-show-guest/  title=The Best…Comedy Panel Show Guest  accessdate=5 May 2007  publisher=Radio Times  archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070527141810/http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/peep-show/the-best-comedy-panel-show-guest/  archivedate=27 May 2007  deadurl=yes  df=dmy }}</ref>

Following his BAFTA win, Mitchell was ranked at No. 53 in the 2009 MediaGuardian 100, an annual ranking of media people in The Guardian.
