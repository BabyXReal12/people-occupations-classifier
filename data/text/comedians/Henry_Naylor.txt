In the summer of 2014 he wrote his first drama-tragedy - The Collector - which won one of the leading awards at the Edinburgh Festival, the Fringe First.
Set in an Iraqi gaol during the occupation of Iraq in 2003, the play attacked brutality on both sides of the conflict. The show transferred off-Londons West End, and played a sell-out season at the Arcola Theatre in November 2014, to critical acclaim.
In autumn of 2016, the show will be going on an extensive 3-month tour of the UK.{{citation needed date=September 2016}}

In 2015, he premiered the second part of his Arabian Nightmares - Echoes. Opening at the Gilded Balloon, it won the Spirit of the Fringe Award at Edinburgh.
Exploring the surprising parallels between the Jihad Jihadi adventurers of today and early Victorian period Victorian pioneers, the play was a provocative and brutal examination of colonialism, and the resonances of history. Echoes received many highly favourable reviews, including one from the The Guardian Guardian’s lead critic Mark Lawson, who described it as a ‘hugely impressive play.’
