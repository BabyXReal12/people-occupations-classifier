The title is in fact a holdover from an entirely different show that Solon had planned to perform with a male partner{{Citation needed date=December 2011}}.

*An Andrew Lloyd Webber fan
*Caroline, an Australian disabled housewife who is possessed by the ghost of Diana, Princess of Wales
*Karen, a prize-winning beautician
