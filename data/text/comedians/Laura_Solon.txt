==Kopfrapers Syndrome: One Man and His Incredible Mind==
The title is in fact a holdover from an entirely different show that Solon had planned to perform with a male partner{{Citation needed date=December 2011}}. When the partner dropped out she rewrote the show in the three weeks leading up to the festival but retained the title in order not to negate the value of the advance publicity or confuse those who had already purchased tickets.

Solon plays eight different characters in the show, which consists of sketches of varying lengths, including:
*An Andrew Lloyd Webber fan
*Caroline, an Australian disabled housewife who is possessed by the ghost of Diana, Princess of Wales
*Karen, a prize-winning beautician
*Borgesia, a Poles Polish story-teller
*A wedding planner from Rotherham
*A hunter who does not believe in zebras
*Katrina, a corporate high-flier with an irrational terror of the Chinese people Chinese
*A marketing assistant forced to dress as a bookworm

As a Perrier award-winning show it secured a run in West End theatre Londons West End, at the Soho Theatre, in November 2005. Solon also received pound sterling £7,500 with the prize.
