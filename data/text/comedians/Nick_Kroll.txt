Although many critics only either mentioned his character in passing, some pointing out his similarities with Albert Einstein,
or his "committed" performance,
Matt Zoller Seitz took particular note of his performance, praising it as "irrepressibly silly" with "an orange juice spit-take voice". Seitz further stated that "[t]he way Kroll savors every syllable of his alternately peevish, self-pitying and nonsensical dialogue—aided mightily by the animators, whove given the character a fireplug body and a waddling walk—transforms the ridiculous into the sublime."
