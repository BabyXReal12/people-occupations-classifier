==Career==
Mooney became a ringmaster (circus) ringmaster with the Gatti-Charles Circus. During his stint as ringmaster, he always found himself writing comedy and telling jokes, which later helped Mooney land his first professional work as a writer for Richard Pryor.

Mooney wrote some of Pryors routines for his appearance on Saturday Night Live, co-wrote his material for the Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip Live on the Sunset Strip, Bicentennial Nigger, and ...Is It Something I Said? Is It Something I Said albums, and Pryors film Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling. As the head writer for The Richard Pryor Show, he gave many young comics, such as Robin Williams, Sandra Bernhard, Marsha Warfield, John Witherspoon (actor) John Witherspoon, and Tim Reid, their first break into show business.

Mooney also wrote for Redd Foxxs Sanford and Son and Good Times, acted in several cult classics including Which Way Is Up?, Bustin Loose (film) Bustin Loose, Hollywood Shuffle, and portrayed singer/songwriter Sam Cooke in The Buddy Holly Story.

He was the head writer for the first year of Fox Broadcasting Company Foxs In Living Color, inspiring the character Homey D. Clown, played by Damon Wayans. Mooney later went on to play Wayans father in the Spike Lee film Bamboozled as the comedian Junebug.

Mooney initially appeared in the sketches "Ask a Black Dude" and "Mooney at the Movies" on Comedy Centrals Chappelles Show. He later appeared as Negrodamus, an African American version of Nostradamus. As Negrodamus, Mooney Ad lib ad-libbed the "answers to lifes most unsolvable mysteries" such as "Why do white people love Wayne Brady?" (Answer: "Because Wayne Brady makes Bryant Gumbel look like Malcolm X.") Mooney was planning to reprise his role as Negrodamus in the third season of the Chappelles Show, before Dave Chappelle left the show due to stress, and it ended suddenly.

In 2006, Paul Mooney hosted the Black Entertainment Television BET tribute to Black History Month titled 25 Most @#%! Moments in Black History. In this show, he narrated some of the most shameful incidents involving African Americans since 1980.

==Controversies==
Much of Mooneys material is based on the subject of racism in the United States.<ref name=V>{{cite web date=February 2, 2016 title=The Curious Decline of Paul Mooney author=Peisner, David url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/01/curious-decline-of-paul-mooney.html publisher=New York (magazine) Vulture.com}}</ref>
 
===BET Comedy Awards===
In September 2005, Mooney performed a segment at the 2005 BET Comedy Awards called the "Nigga Wake Up Call Award", in which he jokingly presents an award to African American celebrities who have had well-publicized legal troubles. The "nominees" included Michael Jackson, Oprah Winfrey, Lil Kim, and Diana Ross. Mooney awarded Ross and made numerous jokes about Ross 2002 arrest for DUI.<ref name="ross">{{cite book last=Mooney first=Paul title=Black is the New White year=2009 publisher=Simon Spotlight Entertainment isbn=978-1-4165-8795-8 pages=239}}</ref> According to people who were in attendance, Mooney also made light of the death of Ross ex-husband Arne Næss Jr., who fell while mountain climbing in 2004.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2011/06/when_comedians_go_too_far_tracy_morgan_paul_mooney_and_more/ title=So Funny It Hurts?

Mooney replied: {{quote How can somebody get arrested for (driving under the influence being under the influence) and go to jail and I be over the top? I think thats over the top, dont you? Agree or disagree, folks. No, comedy is not over the top. When you are a celebrity and you do crazy stuff, thats the game.}}

When Mooney was informed that Tracee Ellis Ross was in the audience, he stated: {{quote 1=I didnt know ... her mama couldve been in there, thats not the point. I didnt drive drunk. Now Im responsible for Diana Ross? If you scrutinize Jay Leno and David Letterman the same way you scrutinize me, then Ill agree with you, but if you dont touch them white folks dont touch me. They say whatever they want to say every night.<ref name="EUR"/>}}

The majority of Mooneys performance was edited out of the televised broadcast and not aired.<ref name="ross" />

===Showtime at the Apollo===
During a 2006 performance at the Apollo Theater in which Mooney was taping a segment for Showtime at the Apollo, his performance was stopped in the middle of his act, allegedly due to his criticisms of President George W. Bush. Mooney appeared on The Howard Stern Show on October 30, 2006, where he talked about the performance, including bringing in his road manager as a witness. During the act, he made several jokes about Bush, including one likening him to the devil and one stating that Barbara Bush his mother looked like the "guy on the Quaker Oats box",<ref>The Howard Stern Show, aired Oct 30, 2006</ref> and was immediately pulled from the stage. A 45-minute debate ensued in his dressing room in which they decided to cancel the rest of his act. Mooney was told that he had "offended unnamed officials from Time Warner",<ref>{{cite web archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101084205/http://www.freemarketnews.com/WorldNews.asp?nid=22914 archivedate=November 1, 2007 date=October 6, 2006 website=Freemarketnews.com url=http://www.freemarketnews.com/WorldNews.asp?nid=22914 title=Is Time Warner Practicing Censorship? accessdate=January 12, 2007}}</ref> which operates Showtime at the Apollo. A Time Warner spokeswoman called the story "ridiculous... its absolutely untrue" that the company had anything to do with the incident. Mooney vowed never to perform at the Apollo again until he receives a straight answer.<ref name="Mooney 2009 242–243">{{cite book last=Mooney first=Paul title=Black is the New White year=2009 publisher=Simon Spotlight Entertainment isbn=978-1-4165-8795-8 pages=242–243}}</ref>

==="The N-Word"===
On November 26, 2006, Mooney appeared on CNN and talked about how he would stop using the word "nigga" due to Michael Richards outbursts on stage at the Laugh Factory.<ref name=CNN>{{cite web author=Anderson, Brooke publisher=CNN url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/blogs/marquee/2006/11/racist-rant-heard-round-world.html date=November 28, 2006 title=The racist rant heard round the world}}</ref> He referred to Richards as having become "his Phil McGraw Dr. Phil" and "cured" him of the use of the epithet. Mooney also said, "Were gonna stop using the n-word. Im gonna stop using it. Im not gonna use it again and Im not gonna use the b-word. And were gonna put an end to the n-word. Just say no to the n-word. We want all human beings throughout the world to stop using the n-word."{{citation needed date=January 2017}}

On November 30, Mooney elaborated upon these remarks from his appearance on CNN as a guest of Farai Chideya on the National Public Radio program News & Notes.<ref name=NPR>{{cite web publisher=NPR title=When the N Word Is Part of a Routine url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=6560171 date=November 30, 2006}}</ref> He declared that he would convene a conference on this controversial subject in the near future, as well as perform his first "n-free" comedy in the upcoming days.<ref name=NPR/>

That show, which he performed at the Lincoln Theatre (Washington, D.C.) Lincoln Theater following a set by Dick Gregory, took place on December 2, 2006. Mooney almost made it through his entire set—about an hour of jokes—before he mistakenly used the word in a routine on O.J. Simpson. He ran off stage covering his face in his hands, and walked back on a few moments later saying, "Im really going to get it now. This is probably already on the Internet." On the BET special 25 Events that Mis-Shaped Black America, Mooney reiterated that he was no longer using the word. He was quoted as saying, "I am no longer going to use the n-word. Instead of saying Whats up my nigga, say Whats up my Michael Richards."  At a summit with Jesse Jackson, Reverend Al Sharpton, and Richards, Mooney forgave Richards.<ref>{{cite book last=Mooney first=Paul title=Black is the New White year=2009 publisher=Simon Spotlight Entertainment isbn=978-1-4165-8795-8 pages=245}}</ref>

===Boston Marathon bombings===
At a performance in West Nyack, New York, on April 20, 2013—five days after the Boston Marathon bombing—Mooney allegedly joked, "white people in Boston deserved what they got and (it was) OK to lose a few limbs... as long as no blacks got hurt it was OK."  Numerous audience members stormed out and the shows producer "Levity Live Comedy Club" cancelled the remaining shows.<ref>{{cite web title=Comic Paul Mooney comes under fire for Boston comments at Levity Live show work=Lohud.com author=Easley, Hema date=April 22, 2013 url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20130422/NEWS03/304220135/Comic-Paul-Mooney-comes-under-fire-Boston-comments-Levity-Live-show}}</ref>  On April 23, Mooney appeared on the Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM Satellite Radio, and denied he had made the comments as reported, particularly denying he said that "white people deserved to be blown up."
