==Personal life==

From 1997 to 2001, she was married to Mark Jackson. They have a son named Shalon Jackson.

MoNique gave birth to twin sons Jonathan and David Hicks in October 2005, two months early.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1115775,00.html title=MoNique a New Mom Again – of Twins work=PEOPLE.com accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref> In 2006, she married their father Sidney Hicks. In a New York Times profile, she mentions that she and Hicks have an open marriage:

{{quote We have an agreement that well always be honest, and if sex happens with another person, thats not a {{sic deal break er hide=y}} for us, thats not something where well have to say, Oh God, weve got to go to divorce court because you cheated on me. Because we dont cheat.<ref>{{cite news url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E3D6103EF936A3575BC0A9619C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 title=Luckily, Theres Plenty of Her for Everybody last=Lee first=Felicia R. date=2007-08-05 publisher=New York Times pages=2}}</ref>}}

She repeated this view later on The Oprah Winfrey Show when she said that, in her prior marriages, she was constantly searching for "that extra oomph".<ref name= Oprah>Sheri Salata (Producer). (Jan 28, 2008). The Oprah Winfrey Show. Chicago: Harpo Productions, Inc.</ref> MoNique explained, 

<blockquote>When I said I had an open marriage, people automatically jumped to sex. They automatically went there. But Ive been best friends with my husband since we were 14 years old. When we say open, were very honest. There are no secrets. Oftentimes you have people that are married, but theyre strangers, and we refuse to be those people.<ref name= Oprahweb>{{cite web archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080131132627/http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200801/20080128/slide_20080128_350_206.jhtml   archivedate = 2008-01-31  url= http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200801/20080128/slide_20080128_350_206.jhtml publisher= Oprah.com title = MoNique on her open marriage. accessdate= January 28, 2008}}</ref></blockquote> 

She concluded, "Ive had to sneak and Ive had to lie, and I dont want to do that any more. But my husband is so awesome and so fine and so—oh, girl...No other man can compare".<ref name=Oprahweb/>
