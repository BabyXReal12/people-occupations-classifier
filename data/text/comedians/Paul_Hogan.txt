==Early life==
Paul Hogan was born in Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, Australia. He moved to Granville, New South Wales Granville in Western Sydney at a young age and worked as a rigger on the Sydney Harbour Bridge.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/sydney-harbour-bridge  title=Sydney Harbour Bridge  website=Australian Government  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512054556/http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/sydney-harbour-bridge  archivedate=12 May 2012  df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.sydneyharbourbridge.info/  title=Information about the Bridge  website=Sydney Harbour Bridge}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/ag-blog/2010/10/painting-the-sydney-harbour-bridge/  title=Painting the Sydney Harbour Bridge  first=Joanna  last=Egan   date=20 October 2010  website=Australian Geographic}}</ref>

==Career==
Hogans first public appearance was on Australian television, the Nine Networks amateur talent program New Faces (Australian talent show) New Faces in 1971.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://laughterlog.com/2009/03/19/paul-hogan  title=Performers: Paul Hogan  first=Peter  last=Tatchell  date=1994   website=Laugh Magazine #9 / Laughterlog}}</ref> Hogan had observed to his Harbour Bridge workmates that the programs entertainment value relied significantly on the judges ridiculing and belittling the performers, and suggested the judges deserved similar treatment. Hogan inveigled his way onto the program by claiming to be a "tap-dancing knife-thrower". Hogan appeared on stage in his work boots, holding elaborate prop knives and proceeded to make a series of jokes at the judges expense; he finished by performing a rudimentary shuffle and throwing the knives onto the floor. Strong positive response from the viewing public saw Hogan invited back for repeated performances on New Faces; in another of these, he proposed to "play the shovels", which consisted of making a series of jokes before banging two shovels together a few times. Hogans natural ability as a comedic performer attracted the attention of Mike Willesee, host of Nines news magazine program A Current Affair (Australian TV series) A Current Affair. Willesee offered Hogan regular appearances on the show, during which Hogan would make humorous comment on some issue of the day. During this time Hogan befriended Current Affair producer John Cornell, who became Hogans manager and business partner.

Hogan followed this with his own comedy sketch program The Paul Hogan Show, which he produced and wrote, and in which he played characters with Cornell and Delvene Delaney. The series, which ran for 60 episodes between 1973 and 1984, was popular in his native country and South Africa, and showcased his trademark lighthearted but laddish ocker humour. Hogan won the 1973 TV Week Logie Awards TV Week Logie Award for Best New Talent.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.tvweeklogieawards.com.au/logie-history/1970s/1973/  title=15th TV Week Logie Awards, 1973  website=TV Week Logie Awards  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410114222/http://www.tvweeklogieawards.com.au/logie-history/1970s/1973/  archivedate=10 April 2013}}</ref> The early series was on Channel Seven and by 1975, it was screened on Channel Nine where it remained until the end of 1984.

In the 1970s, he advertised Winfield (cigarette) Winfield cigarettes in television, print and billboard advertisements in which he wore a formal dinner suit.  These ads always ended with the catchphrase "Anyhow, have a Winfield". During the early 1980s, Hogan filmed a series of television ads promoting the Australian tourism industry, which aired in the United States.  An advertisement with the phrase "shrimp on the barbie" which aired from 1984, was particularly successful.<ref>{{cite journal  last1=Baker  first1=Bill  first2=Peggy  last2=Bendel  issue=Summer 2005  url=http://www.atme.org/pubs/archives/77_1898_11926.cfm   title=Come and Say GDay!  journal=Travel Marketing Decisions  publisher=The Association of Travel Marketing Executives  accessdate=21 December 2007  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104153701/http://www.atme.org/pubs/archives/77_1898_11926.cfm  archivedate=4 November 2007  df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 1985, Hogan starred as an Australian World War I digger named Pat Cleary in the critically acclaimed mini-series Anzacs (TV series) Anzacs which aired on the Nine Network. Cleary was described as the quintessential Aussie larrikin and series writer John Dixon (filmmaker) John Dixon wrote the part of Cleary with Hogan in mind. The series included a "whos who" of Australian television and film actors of the day including Jon Blake (actor) Jon Blake, Andrew Clarke (actor) Andrew Clarke, Megan Williams (actress) Megan Williams, Tony Bonner, Bill Kerr, Ilona Rodgers, Vivean Gray and Robert Coleby.

Throughout the decade, he appeared on British TV in advertisements for Fosters Lager, in which he played an earthy Australian abroad in London. The characters most notable line (spoken incredulously at a ballet performance) "Struth, theres a bloke down there with no strides on!", followed Hogan for years, and the popularity of its "fish out of water" humour was repeated with his next endeavour. In another advertisement from the same Fosters series, Hogans character is approached in a London Underground London Tube station by a Japanese tourist who asks, Do you know the way to Cockfosters? (referring to an area in North London), to which Hogan replies (with a puzzled look on his face): "Drink it warm, mate."

Hogans breakout role was that of Mick "Crocodile" Dundee in the 1986 film Crocodile Dundee. Hogan also co-wrote the movie, which was a massive critical and commercial success in many countries. He won the 1987 Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and was also nominated for Best Actor at the BAFTAs. The screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award, a BAFTA and a Saturn Award. Along with Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn, Hogan co-hosted the 59th Academy Awards, also in 1987. Hogan again portrayed Mick Dundee in the sequel Crocodile Dundee II, released in 1988. Hogan was also executive producer and co-writer with his son, Brett. Although less popular than the first Crocodile Dundee film with critics, it was also a commercial success. The character made him popular in the United States, with phrases like, "Thats not a knife...thats a knife!" entering the lexicon, though Hogan was troubled that the character was perceived as a cross between Chuck Norris and John Rambo, and turned down roles similar to those due to their violent nature, commenting:

{{Cquote The movie scene is screaming out for the movie hero who doesnt kill 75 people... less of those Commando (1985 film) commandos, The Terminator terminators, The Exterminator ex-terminators and squashers. Micks a good role model. Theres no malice in the fellow and hes human. Hes not a wimp or a sissy just because he doesnt kill people.<ref name="office">{{Cite magazine  title=Box office war  first=Ivor  last=Davies  magazine=TV Week  date=4 June 1988  page=11}}</ref>}}

In the early 1990s, a Paramount executive pitched a concept of a Crocodile Dundee / Beverly Hills Cop fictional crossover crossover movie.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://splitsider.com/2012/11/a-crocodile-dundee-crossover-and-two-other-rejected-ideas-for-beverly-hills-cop-iii/  title=A Crocodile Dundee Crossover and Two Other Rejected Ideas for Beverly Hills Cop III  first=Bradford  last=Evans  date=15 November 2012  website=Splitsider}}</ref> Hogan refused the starring role in the hit film Ghost (1990 film) Ghost, choosing instead to make Almost an Angel (1990).<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099653/trivia  title=Ghost (1990)  work=IMDb}}</ref> In 1994 Hogan co-produced, wrote and starred in the Western (genre) Western Comedy film comedy film Lightning Jack. In 1996 Hogan starred in a remake of the Flipper (1963 film) 1963 film Flipper (1996 film) Flipper, a family-friendly movie about a dolphin. In 1998 he co-starred in the Made-for-TV movie made-for-TV drama Floating Away, an adaptation of the Tim Sandlin book Sorrow Floats. Hogan played Shane, a recovering alcoholic.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0143891/trivia  title=Floating Away (1998)  work=IMDb}}</ref>

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, he was featured in advertisements for the Subaru Outback. In 2001, Hogan returned to the role that made him famous with Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles.

In 2004, Hogan starred in the Australian-produced comedy film Strange Bedfellows (2004 film) Strange Bedfellows, about two firemen pretending to be in a homosexual relationship for financial benefit. Strange Bedfellows was written and directed by Hogans friend Dean Murphy and was the highest-grossing Australian-made film of 2004. 2005 saw the release of Paul Hogan - Stand Up Hoges, a DVD compilation of Hogans favourite live performances throughout his career. In 2009, Hogan starred in another of Murphys films, Charlie & Boots, a road-movie concerning the relationship between a father (Hogan) and son (Shane Jacobson). It was the second-highest grossing Australian-made film of 2009, after Maos Last Dancer (film) Maos Last Dancer.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/australia/yearly/?yr=2009&p=.htm  title=2009 Australian Yearly Box Office  website=Box Office Mojo}}</ref>

In 2013, 2014 and 2015 Hogan embarked on live stand-up performances throughout Australia.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.hogeslive.com.au  title=Hoges Live!  website=hogeslive.com.au}}</ref> The 2013 An Evening with Hoges tour featured capital cities only but the 2014 tour Hoges: One Night Only featured 25 locations including regional Australia. 2015s Hoges: Live saw shows in Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney only. Some of this material was shown in the 2014 Documentary film documentary Hanging with Hoges, in which Hogan was interviewed about his life and career by Shane Jacobson.

In 2016 Hogan received the Longford Lyell Award for an outstanding contribution to the Australian screen. Hogan joked hed only ever been a "one-hit wonder".<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/awards/im-a-huge-onehit-wonder-paul-hogan-lands-highest-australian-film-award/news-story/ecea5d08d63f076200fd730f175944d6  title=Im a huge one-hit wonder: Paul Hogan lands highest Australian film award  date=6 December 2016  website=News.com.au}}</ref>

Hogan and his first wife, Noelene Edwards, married in 1958. They separated and divorced in 1981 and remarried less than one year later. A second divorce, initiated in 1986, was considered one of Australias ugliest celebrity divorces.<ref>{{Cite news  url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/paul-hogan-marries-son-off/story-e6freq7x-1111115125567  title=Paul Hogan and Noelene marry son off  date=15 December 2007  newspaper=The Sunday Mail (Brisbane) The Sunday Mail  accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref> Hogan married his Crocodile Dundee co-star Linda Kozlowski in 1990.

===Tax problems===
In 2007 Hogan was named as one of a group in connection to a A$300&nbsp;million Australian tax fraud investigation called Operation Wickenby, investigating 23 companies for allegedly using overseas companies to hide income.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.news.com.au/business/story/0,23636,21218043-462,00.html   title=Paul Hogan linked to $300m tax fraud case  first=Susannah  last=Moran  date=13 February 2007  newspaper=The Australian}}</ref> In July 2008, Hogan commented to Network Ten that he had "paid plenty of tax" in Australia and that he had nothing to fear from the Australian Taxation Office investigation.<ref>{{cite news  title=Paul Hogan taunts taxman; Come and get me you bastards  url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23969191-5015795,00.html  newspaper=The Daily Telegraph (Sydney) The Daily Telegraph  date=4 July 2008}}</ref>

In October 2008, Hogan scored a major victory in his tax fight with the Australian Crime Commission, who were forced to pay up to an estimated A$5&nbsp;million for legal bills dating back to 2006 and were required to return seized personal financial documents that they had admitted were irrelevant.<ref name="tax">{{cite news  first1=Janet  last1=Fife-Yeomans  first2=Vicky  last2=Roach  url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,,24568267-5001021,00.html  title=Defiant Paul Hogan humbles tax case clowns  newspaper=The Daily Telegraph (Sydney) The Daily Telegraph  date=29 October 2008}}</ref> Hogan has not been charged in connection with the investigation, which began in 2003.<ref name="tax"/>

On 18 June 2010 in the Australian High Court, Hogan lost a long-running legal battle to keep the contents of his tax documents secret, paving the way for details of his offshore accounts to be published. Earlier the same year, Australian media reported that the Australian Crime Commission was in the final stages of preparing to lay criminal charges of tax evasion against Hogan, film producer John Cornell and their accountant Anthony Stewart, who it suspected channeled millions of dollars from the proceeds of the film Crocodile Dundee and other films into Offshore bank offshore tax havens. The release of the documents is expected to help finalize the Tax Offices case.<ref>{{cite news  url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/7832537/Crocodile-Dundee-Paul-Hogans-off-shore-tax-accounts-to-be-published.html  location=London, UK  newspaper=The Daily Telegraph  title=Crocodile Dundee Paul Hogans off-shore tax accounts to be published  first=Bonnie  last=Malkin  date=16 June 2010}}</ref>

On 20 August 2010, Hogan flew to Sydney for his mothers funeral. Upon arrival he was issued a Departure Prohibition Order by the Australian Taxation Office, which prevented him leaving the country until his alleged tax debt was paid or settled. The nations tax office claims he owes taxes on A$37.5&nbsp;million of undeclared income.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1306024/Crocodile-Dundee-star-Paul-Hogan-trapped-Australian-taxman-unpaid-bill.html  location=London, UK  newspaper=The Daily Mail  title=Crocodile Dundee star Paul Hogan banned from leaving Australia by taxman over unpaid bill on Â£21.4m of undeclared income  date=25 August 2010}}</ref>  On 3 September, Hogan was granted permission to return to the US through an agreement between his lawyers and Australian tax officials, though the terms of the agreement have not been disclosed. Hogan continues to deny any wrongdoing in the case.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/38986923/ns/today-entertainment/  website=MSNBC  title=Crocodile Dundee to return to US amid tax fray  date=3 September 2010  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905201623/http://www.today.msnbc.msn.com/id/38986923/ns/today-entertainment  archivedate=5 September 2010  df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In November 2010, the Australian Tax Office dropped its criminal investigation of him and his business manager for tax evasion.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/11/24/us-paulhogan-tax-idUSTRE6AN0TB20101124  website=Reuters  title=Crocodile Dundees Paul Hogan gets early Christmas present  date=24 November 2010}}</ref>

In January 2011, it was announced that Hogan was suing the Australian government, his lawyer stating that Hogans "earning potential and reputation has been decimated."<ref>{{cite web  url=http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/blog/article/112376/crocodile-dundee-star-to-sue-australian-government.html  title=Crocodile Dundee star to sue Australian government  website=Yahoo!

In May 2012, it was announced that, following mediation before an ex-High Court judge, the entities settled with the Commissioner of Taxation in an agreement "without admission". The parties have agreed that the terms of the settlement are to be confidential, but as part of the settlement, the Departure Prohibition Order has been revoked by the Commissioner.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/paul-hogan-settles-tax-dispute-20120501-1xvmo.html  title=Paul Hogan settles tax dispute  date=1 May 2012  newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2012/05/04/crocodile-tears-for-paul-hogan-tax-travails  title=Crocodile Tears For Paul Hogan Tax Travails  first=Robert W.  last=Wood  date=4 May 2012  website=Forbes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17904063  title=Actor Paul Hogans Australia tax battle over  date=1 May 2012  website=BBC News}}</ref> As of April 2013, Hogans financial advisor Stewart remained in a dispute with the Australian Tax Office.<ref name="Kate">{{cite news  title=Hogan chases his financial adviser and stolen millions  url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/hogan-chases-his-financial-adviser-and-stolen-millions-20130414-2htu0.html  date=15 April 2013  first1=Kate  last1=McClymont  first2=Francois  last2=Pilet  newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald  accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref>

Hogan then reappeared in the media in April 2013 due to an AU$32.3 million issue with a Swiss bank run by the Geneva firm Strachans. Following the placement of the monetary sum in an offshore account for the purpose of tax avoidance, Hogan is unable to access the funds as of April 2013 and a United States court action that sought AU$80 million in damages proved unsuccessful for Hogan.<ref>{{cite news  title=Paul Hogans battle with Swiss firm for stolen $32m  url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/paul-hogans-battle-with-swiss-bank-for-stolen-32m/story-e6frg8zx-1226620346431  accessdate=18 April 2013  newspaper=The Australian  date=15 April 2013  first=Susannah  last=Moran}}</ref> Hogan publicly stated that he believes that Philip Egglishaw, the principal of Strachans and a former tax advisor to Hogan, has absconded with the money and Hogans American legal representative Schuyler "Sky" Moore filed corresponding documents in a Californian Court based on this claim.<ref name="Kate" /> On 18 April 2013, it was reported that Egglishaw denied the allegations of his former client.<ref>{{cite news  title=Philip Egglishaw denies Paul Hogan theft  url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/philip-egglishaw-denies-paul-hogan-theft/story-e6frg8zx-1226623051046  accessdate=18 April 2013  newspaper=The Australian  date=18 April 2013  first=Susannah  last=Moran}}</ref>
