Roseanne Cherrie Barr (born November 3, 1952) is an American actress, comedian, writer, and television producer. Barr began her career in stand-up comedy at clubs before gaining critical and popular acclaim in the television sitcom Roseanne (1988–1997; 2018). She won both an Emmy Award Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her work on the show.

Barr was born into a Jewish family living in Salt Lake City, Utah. She became a standup comedian in 1980. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, she began to emerge as a celebrity through her role in Roseanne and other public performances. Barr sparked controversy when performing "The Star-Spangled Banner" at a nationally aired baseball game on July 25, 1990. After singing the anthem in what many perceived to be a deliberately disrespectful manner, Barr grabbed her crotch and spat. This performance was met with condemnation from baseball fans and sportswriters, and was called "disgraceful" by then-President George H. W. Bush.<ref name=Anthem>{{cite web  url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/07/23/roseanne-on-the-day-she-shrieked-the-star-spangled-banner-grabbed-her-crotch-and-earned-a-rebuke-from-president-bush/  title= Roseanne on the day she shrieked ‘The Star-Spangled Banner,’ grabbed her crotch and earned a rebuke from President Bush  date=July 23, 2015  accessdate=May 31, 2018}}</ref>

In 1987, The Cosby Show executive producers Carsey-Werner Productions Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner wanted to bring a "no-perks family comedy" to television. They hired Cosby writer Matt Williams (producer) Matt Williams to write a script about factory workers and signed Barr to play Roseanne Conner.<ref name="EW2008pg1">{{cite web url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20235368,00.html title=A Roseanne Family Reunion – The behind-the-scenes truth about Roseanne Barrs groundbreaking sitcom last=Stransky first=Tanner work=Entertainment Weekly publisher=Time Inc. page=1 date=October 24, 2008 accessdate=February 17, 2011 archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xmZxURct?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20235368,00.html archivedate=April 8, 2011 deadurl=no df=mdy-all}}</ref>

During the first season, Barr sought more creative control over the show, opposing Williams authority. Barr refused to say certain lines and eventually walked off set.

Roseanne ran for nine seasons from 1988 to 1997.
