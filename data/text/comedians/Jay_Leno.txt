===The Tonight Show===

Starting in 1987, Leno was a regular substitute host for Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show. In 1992, he replaced Carson as host<ref>{{cite news title=Carson cuts appearances url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NQMIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SzYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5008,192179&dq=tonight+jay-leno+shandling agency=Associated Press work=Rome News-Tribune location=Rome, Ga. page=14 date=June 2, 1987 accessdate=October 26, 2008}}</ref> amid controversy with David Letterman, who had been hosting Late Night with David Letterman since 1982 (aired after The Tonight Show), and whom many—including Carson himself—had expected to be Carsons successor. The story of this turbulent transition was later turned into The Late Shift (book) a book and The Late Shift (film) a movie. Leno continued to perform as a stand-up comedian throughout his tenure on The Tonight Show.

In 2004, Leno signed a contract extension with NBC which would keep him as host of The Tonight Show until 2009.<ref>{{cite news title=NBC signs Jay Leno to contract extension url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-03-30-leno-contract-extended_x.htm  agency=Associated Press work=USA Today date=March 31, 2004 accessdate=October 26, 2008}}</ref> Later in 2004, Conan OBrien signed a contract with NBC under which OBrien would become the host of The Tonight Show in 2009, replacing Leno at that time.<ref>{{cite news first=Bill last=Carter title=Conan OBrien to Succeed Jay Leno in 2009, NBC Announces url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/27/business/media/28CND-NBC.html?pagewanted=print&position=  work=The New York Times date=September 27, 2004 accessdate=October 26, 2008}}</ref>

During the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, Leno was accused of violating WGA guidelines by writing his own monologue for The Tonight Show. While NBC and Leno claim there were private meetings with the WGA where there was a secret agreement allowing this, the WGA denied such a meeting.<ref>{{cite web accessdate=May 11, 2008 url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/lenowga-whats-the-real-story-nbc-claims-jay-asked-for-received-wga-permission-to-write-monologue-at-monday-meeting-with-verrone-et-al/ title=LENO/WGA: WHATS THE REAL STORY?

====Michael Jackson trial====
During the Trial of Michael Jackson 2005 trial of Michael Jackson over allegations of child molestation, Leno was one of a few celebrities who appeared as a defense witness. In his testimony regarding a call by the accuser, Leno testified that he never called the police, that no money was asked for, and there was no coaching – but that the calls seemed unusual and scripted.<ref>{{cite web accessdate=May 11, 2008 url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/jackson/052405_ctv.html title=Comedians Jay Leno and Chris Tucker testify for Michael Jackson publisher=Court TV date=May 24, 2005 author=Sweetingham, Lisa  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315195750/http://www.courttv.com/trials/jackson/052405_ctv.html  archivedate= March 15, 2008}}</ref>

File:JayLeno.jpg thumb right Leno in 2006
As a result, Leno was initially not allowed to tell jokes about Jackson or the case, which had been a fixture of The Tonight Show{{}}s opening monologue in particular. But he and his shows writers used a legal loophole by having Leno briefly step aside while stand-in comedians took the stage and told jokes about the trial. Stand-ins included Roseanne Barr, Drew Carey, Brad Garrett, and Dennis Miller, among others.<ref>{{cite episode accessdate=May 11, 2008 url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0503/08/sbt.01.html title=Nemcova Speaks Out on Surviving Tsunami; Michael Jackson`s Trial Continues; Interview With Kevin Costner  series=Showbiz Tonight publisher=CNN airdate=March 8, 2005 first=Karyn last=Bryant}}</ref> The gag order was challenged, and the court ruled that Leno could continue telling jokes about the trial as long as he did not discuss his testimony. Leno celebrated by devoting an entire monologue to Michael Jackson jokes.

On January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that beginning March 1, 2010, Jay Leno would move from his 10 p.m. weeknight time slot to 11:35&nbsp;p.m., due to a combination of pressure from local affiliates whose newscasts were suffering, and both Lenos and OBriens poor ratings.<ref>{{cite news  url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/01/future-for-nbcs-the-jay-leno-show-is-up-in-the-air.html  title= Future For NBCs Tonight Show Up In The Air  work= Los Angeles Times blog  date= January 2010  access-date= }}</ref><ref name= access>{{cite news  url= http://www.accesshollywood.com/articles/jay-leno-heading-back-to-late-night-conan-obrien-weighing-options-80698/   website= accesshollywood.com  title= Jay Leno Heading Back To Late Night, Conan O’Brien Weighing Options  date= January 8, 2010  access-date= January 9, 2017}}</ref> Lenos show would be shortened from an hour to 30 minutes.

Howard Stern has also been a harsh critic of Leno before and following his Tonight Show timeslot change announcement;<ref name="stern">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ2fZH2XqNw&feature=related "Rosie ODonnell Slams Jay Leno (Part 1 of 2)"]; YouTube; January 14, 2010</ref> Stern appeared on Late Night with Conan OBrien in 2006, and told OBrien that he felt it was unlikely that Leno would ever willingly give up The Tonight Show to anyone.<ref>[http://talkshownews.interbridge.com/2010/01/howard-stern-to-conan-in-2006-i-dont.html "Howard Stern to Conan in 2006: I dont see this guy leaving"] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221232040/http://talkshownews.interbridge.com/2010/01/howard-stern-to-conan-in-2006-i-dont.html  date=February 21, 2010 }} Talk Show News; January 15, 2010</ref> During the conflict, Stern made many negative remarks directed at Leno while on the Late Show with David Letterman.<ref>{{cite web last1=FISHER first1=LUCHINA title=Howard Stern Gets in Another Dig at Leno url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=7793427 website=ABC News accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref>

In addition to criticism about his handling of the timeslot conflict, Leno has also been criticized for the perceived change in the content of his monologues from his previous stand-up material. Actor and comedian Patton Oswalt was among the celebrities who openly voiced disappointment with Leno, saying, "Comedians who dont like Jay Leno now, and Im one of them, were not like, Jay Leno sucks; its that were so hurt and disappointed that one of the best comedians of our generation... willfully has shut the switch off."<ref name="huffpost">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/11/patton-oswalt-weighs-in-o_n_419015.html "Patton Oswalt: Jay Leno Is Like Nixon, I Dont Like Him"].

===Support for Leno===
NBC Sports chairman and former Saturday Night Live producer Dick Ebersol spoke out against all who had mocked Leno, calling them "chicken-hearted and gutless".<ref name="latimes11510">[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-leno-backlash16-2010jan16,0,4645138.story "Taking on Americas nice guy{{"}}].

Jay Leno is the consummate professional and one of the hardest-working people in television. Its a shame that hes being pulled into this."<ref name="latimes11510-2" /> Fellow comedians Paul Reiser, Jerry Seinfeld and Jim Norton (American comedian) Jim Norton (a frequent contributor to The Tonight Show) also voiced support for Leno.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-reiser/a-teachable-leno-moment_b_418197.html "Paul Reiser: A Teachable Moment"].
