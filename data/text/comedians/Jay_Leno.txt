During the 1970s, Leno appeared in minor roles in several television series and films, first in the 1976 episode "J.J. in Trouble" of Good Times and the same year in the pilot of Holmes &amp; Yo-Yo.

===The Tonight Show===

Starting in 1987, Leno was a regular substitute host for Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show. In 1992, he replaced Carson as host
amid controversy with David Letterman, who had been hosting Late Night with David Letterman since 1982 (aired after The Tonight Show), and whom many—including Carson himself—had expected to be Carsons successor. The story of this turbulent transition was later turned into The Late Shift (book) a book and The Late Shift (film) a movie. Leno continued to perform as a stand-up comedian throughout his tenure on The Tonight Show.

In 2004, Leno signed a contract extension with NBC which would keep him as host of The Tonight Show until 2009.
Later in 2004, Conan OBrien signed a contract with NBC under which OBrien would become the host of The Tonight Show in 2009, replacing Leno at that time.
During the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, Leno was accused of violating WGA guidelines by writing his own monologue for The Tonight Show. While NBC and Leno claim there were private meetings with the WGA where there was a secret agreement allowing this, the WGA denied such a meeting.
Leno answered questions in front of the Writers Guild of America, West trial committee in February 2009 and June 2009, and when the WGAW published its list of strike-breakers on August 11, 2009, Leno was not on the list.
Leno said in 2008 that he was saving all of his income from The Tonight Show and living solely off his income from stand-up comedy.
On April 23, 2009, Leno checked himself into a hospital with an undisclosed illness.
He was released the following day and returned to work on Monday, April 27. The two subsequently cancelled Tonight Show episodes for April 23 and 24 were Lenos first in 17 years as host.
Initially, the illness that caused the absence was not disclosed, but later Leno told People magazine that the ailment was exhaustion.
====Michael Jackson trial====
During the Trial of Michael Jackson 2005 trial of Michael Jackson over allegations of child molestation, Leno was one of a few celebrities who appeared as a defense witness. In his testimony regarding a call by the accuser, Leno testified that he never called the police, that no money was asked for, and there was no coaching – but that the calls seemed unusual and scripted.

As a result, Leno was initially not allowed to tell jokes about Jackson or the case, which had been a fixture of The Tonight Show{{}}s opening monologue in particular. But he and his shows writers used a legal loophole by having Leno briefly step aside while stand-in comedians took the stage and told jokes about the trial. Stand-ins included Roseanne Barr, Drew Carey, Brad Garrett, and Dennis Miller, among others.
The gag order was challenged, and the court ruled that Leno could continue telling jokes about the trial as long as he did not discuss his testimony. Leno celebrated by devoting an entire monologue to Michael Jackson jokes.

===Succession by Conan OBrien and The Jay Leno Show===
{{Main article The Jay Leno Show}}
Because Lenos show continued to lead all late-night programming in the Nielsen ratings, the pending expiration of Lenos contract led to speculation about whether he would become a late-night host for another network after his commitment to NBC expired.
Leno left The Tonight Show on Friday, May 29, 2009,
and Conan OBrien took over on June 1, 2009.

On December 8, 2008, it was reported that Leno would remain on NBC and move to a new hour-long show at 10 p.m. Eastern Time (9 p.m. Central Time) five nights a week.
This show followed a similar format to The Tonight Show, was filmed in the same studio facility and retained many of Lenos most popular segments. Late Night with Conan OBrien Late Night host Conan OBrien was his successor on The Tonight Show.
Jay Lenos new show, titled The Jay Leno Show, debuted on September 14, 2009. It was announced at the Television Critics Association summer press tour that it would feature one or two celebrities, the occasional musical guest, and keep the popular "Headlines" segments, which would air near the end of the show. First guests included Jerry Seinfeld, Oprah Winfrey (via satellite), and a short sit-down with Kanye West discussing his controversy at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, which had occurred the night before.
===Timeslot conflict and return to The Tonight Show===

In their new roles, neither OBrien nor Leno succeeded in delivering the viewing audiences the network anticipated. On January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that beginning March 1, 2010, Jay Leno would move from his 10 p.m. weeknight time slot to 11:35 p.m., due to a combination of pressure from local affiliates whose newscasts were suffering, and both Lenos and OBriens poor ratings.
Lenos show would be shortened from an hour to 30 minutes. All NBC late night programming would be preempted by the 2010 Winter Olympics between February 15 and 26. This would move The Tonight Show to 12:05 a.m., a post-midnight timeslot for the first time in its history. OBriens contract stipulated that NBC could move the show back to 12:05 a.m. without penalty (a clause put in primarily to accommodate sports preemptions).
On January 10, NBC confirmed that they would move Jay Leno out of primetime as of February 12 and intended to move him to late night as soon as possible.
TMZ.com TMZ reported that OBrien was given no advance notice of this change, and that NBC offered him two choices: an hour-long 12:05am time slot, or the option to leave the network.
On January 12, OBrien issued a press release that stated he would not continue with Tonight if it moved to a 12:05 a.m. time slot,
saying, "I believe that delaying The Tonight Show into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. The Tonight Show at 12:05 simply isnt The Tonight Show."

On January 21, it was announced that NBC had struck a deal with OBrien. It was decided that OBrien would leave The Tonight Show. The deal was made that OBrien would receive a $33 million payout and that his staff of almost 200 would receive $12 million in the departure. OBriens final episode aired on Friday, January 22, 2010.
Leno returned as host of The Tonight Show following the 2010 Winter Olympics on March 1, 2010.

On July 1, 2010, Variety (magazine) Variety reported that total viewership for Jay Lenos Tonight Show had dropped from 5 million to 4 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. Although this represented the lowest second-quarter ratings for the show since 1992, Tonight was still the most-watched late night program, ahead of American Broadcasting Company ABCs Nightline (3.7 million) and Late Show with David Letterman (3.3 million).
===Announcement of successor===
On April 3, 2013, NBC announced that Leno would leave The Tonight Show in spring 2014, with Jimmy Fallon as his designated successor.
Leno sang the "Tonight (1956 song) Tonight"s parody of Tonight Show with Fallon.

Lenos final show as the host of the Tonight Show was on February 6, 2014 with his final guest Billy Crystal and musical guest Garth Brooks, along with a few surprise guests, including Jack Black, Kim Kardashian, Jim Parsons, Sheryl Crow, Chris Paul, Carol Burnett, and Oprah Winfrey.

===After The Tonight Show===
Leno has maintained an active schedule as a touring stand-up comedian appearing in, on average, 200 live performances a year in venues across the United States and Canada
as well as charity events and USO tours.
