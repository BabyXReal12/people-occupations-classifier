clergyman, and Emma Johnson (née Harris; September 21, 1931 – August 29, 2010),
a nurse and teacher.
She was raised in the Chelsea-Elliot Houses.

She attended a local Catholic school, St Columbas, when she was younger. Her more recent forebears migrated north from Faceville, Georgia, Palatka, Florida and Virginia.
She dropped out of Washington Irving Campus Washington Irving High School.
She has stated that her stage forename ("Whoopi") was taken from a whoopee cushion; "When youre performing on stage, you never really have time to go into the bathroom and close the door. So if you get a little gassy, youve got to let it go. So people used to say to me, Youre like a whoopee cushion. And thats where the name came from."
She said in 2011, "My mother did not name me Whoopi, but Goldberg is my name, its part of my family, part of my heritage. Just like being black."
Henry Louis Gates Jr., in his book In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past, found that all of Goldbergs traceable ancestors were African Americans, that she has no known Jewish ancestry, and that none of her ancestors were named Goldberg.
Results of a DNA test, revealed in the 2006 PBS documentary African American Lives, traced part of her ancestry to the Papel people Papel and Bayote people of modern-day Guinea-Bissau. Her Miscegenation#Genetic studies of racial admixture admixture test indicates that she is of 92 per cent sub-Saharan African origin and of 8 per cent European origin.
According to an anecdote told by Nichelle Nichols in Trekkies (film) Trekkies (1997), a young Goldberg was watching Star Trek: The Original Series Star Trek, and upon seeing Nicholss character Uhura, exclaimed, "Momma! Theres a black lady on television and she aint no maid!"
This spawned lifelong fandom of Star Trek for Goldberg, who would eventually ask for and receive Guinan (Star Trek) a recurring guest-starring role on Star Trek: The Next Generation.

In the 1970s, Goldberg relocated to Southern California before settling in Berkeley, California Berkeley,
where she worked various odd jobs, including as a bank teller, a mortuary cosmetologist, and a bricklayer.
There, she joined the avant-garde theater troupe, the Blake Street Hawkeyes,
and taught comedy and acting classes which were attended by Courtney Love.
Between 1979 and 1981, she lived in East Germany,
