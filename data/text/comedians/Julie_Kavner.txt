===Early career===
In 1973, Kavner auditioned for a role as one of Rhoda Morgensterns sisters in The Mary Tyler Moore Show. David Davis, producer of the show, had convinced her to audition for the part, but decided to cast another actress instead.
A year later, Rhoda Morgenstern became the leading character in a spin-off called Rhoda. Kavner was cast in her first professional acting role as Brenda Morgenstern, sister of the eponymous character.

She also starred in several stage plays, including a play called It Had to be You

Kavner commented, "What I do is not mimicry or an impersonation, but more of an assimilation. [On The Tracey Ullman Show] we did a lot of looking at people to find out who to base our characters on. We did our homework on our lunch hour."
She received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program Best Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.
===The Simpsons===

Kavner became most famous for her role as Marge Simpson on the animated television show The Simpsons, a show that continues to the present. The Tracey Ullman Show included The Simpsons shorts a series of animated shorts about the dysfunctional Simpson family. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Kavner and fellow cast member Dan Castellaneta to voice Marge and Homer rather than hire more actors.
Kavner has what Hilary de Vries of The New York Times described as a "honeyed gravel voice".
Kavner says her distinctive voice is due to "a bump on [her] vocal cords".
Although Marge is her most famous character, Kavners favorite characters to voice are her sisters Patty and Selma Patty and Selma Bouvier because "theyre really funny and sad at the same time".
Series creator Matt Groening instructed Kavner to voice the duo as characters who "suck the life out of everything".
Both have similar raspy voices, but Pattys voice is more masculine and has a lower register, while Selmas voice is a little sweeter.
Kavner also provides the voices of every other female member of the Bouvier family, including Marges mother Jaqueline Bouvier Jacqueline, Great-Aunt Gladys (a dead relative who was introduced on season fours "Selmas Choice"), and an unnamed grandmother seen on the season six episode "Fear of Flying (The Simpsons) Fear of Flying".
Part of Kavners contract says that she will never have to promote The Simpsons on video and she rarely performs Marges voice in public because she believes it "destroys the illusion. People feel these are real people."
Kavner takes recording sessions seriously, and feels that voice acting is, "a little more limiting than live acting. And I have nothing to do with my characters movement."
Nancy Cartwright, who voices Bart Simpson, said in her book My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that Kavner is "a workhorse of an actor" with "extraordinary professionalism and quiet work ethic", and notes that she is rarely late for recording sessions.
Until 1998, Kavner was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing to cast new voices.
