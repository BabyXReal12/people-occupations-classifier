The tabloids also published intrusive information about his relationships and the schooling of his child. Coogan has also been critical of the broadsheet press, saying they have colluded with the tabloids in the interests of selling newspapers. In 2005 he said The Guardian tends to have its cake and eat it.

Coogan said that because of the persistent intrusion into his private life, the press had effectively made him "immune" to further attack, as his "closet is empty of skeletons".<ref>{{cite web title=Steve Coogan gives evidence to Leveson Inquiry into media ethics url=http://www.suchsmallportions.com/pg/news/suchsmallportions/read/38613/steve-coogan-gives-evidence-to-levenson-inquiry-into-media-ethics work=Such small portions the comedy digest publisher=such.small.portions 2011 accessdate=24 November 2011 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406111138/http://www.suchsmallportions.com/pg/news/suchsmallportions/read/38613/steve-coogan-gives-evidence-to-levenson-inquiry-into-media-ethics archivedate=6 April 2012 df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Phone hacking===
{{Main article News of the World phone hacking affair}}
Coogan became a prominent figure in the News International phone hacking scandal as one of the celebrities who took action against the British tabloids in light of these events. He was made aware by his Telecommunications service provider phone service provider of "possible anomalies" on his phone in 2005 and 2006.<ref name=Milmo-15-02-2011>{{cite news last=Milmo first=Cahal title=Phone hackers targeted treasure trove of information, says Coogan url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/phone-hackers-targeted-treasure-trove-of-information-says-coogan-2215050.html accessdate=24 November 2011 newspaper=The Independent date=15 February 2011 location=London}}</ref> In 2010, Coogans legal firm obtained a partially Sanitization (classified information) redacted version of Glenn Mulcaires phone hacking hacking notebook by a court order which showed Coogan had been targeted and his personal information was in the possession of Mulcaire.

Mulcaire was forced by the High Court of Justice to disclose to Coogans legal team who amongst the staff at the News of the World ordered him to hack phones. This information was obtained by Coogans lawyers on 26 August 2011.<ref name=Chandrasekhar-10-11-2011>{{cite news last=Chandrasekhar first=Indu title=Phone hacking: timeline of the scandal url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/8634176/Phone-hacking-timeline-of-a-scandal.html#2011 accessdate=24 November 2011 date=10 November 2011 work=The Daily Telegraph location=London}}</ref>
Interviewed on Newsnight on 8 July 2011, Coogan said he was "delighted" by the closure of the News of the World and said it was a "fantastic day for journalism". He said the idea of press freedom was used by the tabloids as a "smokescreen for selling papers with tittle-tattle" and said the argument against press regulation was "moral bankruptcy morally bankrupt".<ref name=YouTube-8-07-2011/>

Coogan provided an eight-page witness statement to the Leveson Inquiry and appeared at the inquiry on 22 November 2011 to discuss the evidence.<ref name="Leveson statement-23-11-2011"/> He said he was there reluctantly representing a lot of celebrities who felt they could not speak out for fear of reprisals from the tabloid press.<ref>{{cite news title=This is not the Steve Coogan and Hugh Grant show url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/people-news/leveson-inquiry/42898/not-steve-coogan-and-hugh-grant-show accessdate=24 November 2011 newspaper=The Week date=22 November 2011}}</ref>
