Ronald William George Barker, {{post-nominals country=GBR size=100% OBE}} (25 September 1929&nbsp;– 3 October 2005) was an English actor, comedian and writer. He was known for roles in British comedy television series such as Porridge (TV series) Porridge, The Two Ronnies, and Open All Hours.

Barker began acting in repertory theatre and decided he was best suited to comic roles. He had his first success at the Oxford Playhouse and in roles in the West End including Tom Stoppards The Real Inspector Hound. During this period, he was in the cast of BBC radio and television comedies such as The Navy Lark. He got his television break with the satirical sketch series The Frost Report in 1966, where he met future collaborator, Ronnie Corbett. He joined David Frosts production company and starred in ITV (TV network) ITV shows including a short film.

After rejoining the BBC, Barker found fame with the sketch show The Two Ronnies (1971–1987), with Ronnie Corbett. He starred in the sitcoms Porridge, its sequel Going Straight and Open All Hours. He wrote comedy under his own name, though for much of his written material after 1968 he adopted pseudonyms (including "Gerald Wiley") to avoid pre-judgments of his writing talent. He won a BAFTA for British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance best light entertainment performance four times, among other awards, and received an Officer of the Order of the British Empire OBE in 1978.

Later television sitcoms such as The Magnificent Evans and Clarence (1988 TV series) Clarence were less successful and he retired in December 1987. The following year, he opened an antiques shop with his wife, Joy. After 1999, he appeared in smaller, non-comic roles in films. He died of heart failure on 3 October 2005, aged 76.

==Career==

===Theatrical career===
Barker failed to get into the Young Vic School,<ref name=guardobit/> but joined the Manchester Repertory Company, which was based in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, often taking comic roles in their weekly shows. Initially he was employed as the assistant to the assistant stage manager, earning £2.10s.0d (£2.50) a week.<ref name=C38/> He made his debut as a professional actor on 15 November 1948 as Lieutenant Spicer in a performance of J.M. Barries Quality Street (play) Quality Street.<ref name=timesobit/> He went on to play the organist in When We Are Married and by his third role, the chauffeur Charles in Miranda, Barker realised he wanted to be a comic actor. He was described as "ha[ving] the talent to be a great straight actor",<ref name=C39/> but noted: "I want to make people laugh. Never mind about Hamlet. Forget Richard the Second. Give me Charleys Aunt. My mission in life was now crystal clear."<ref name=C39>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=39}}</ref> He appeared in stage adaptations of Treasure Island and Red Riding Hood before getting his first leading role in The Guinea Pig (Chetham-Strode) The Guinea Pig as a working class boy at a public school.<ref name=C39/> When the production moved to Rhyl, Barker followed. The Manchester Repertory Company closed, as did the Rhyl company shortly after.<ref name=guardobit/> Barker, aged 20, then spent some time as a porter at Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre Wingfield Hospital; he became distressed through his contact with polio patients and so opted to take on the persona of "Charlie" so as not to be himself. He and a male nurse often entertained the patients with comedy routines. He found work at the Mime Theatre Company, performing mimed folk music and dance, which soon folded in Penzance.<ref name=C40>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=40–41}}</ref> He made his way back to Oxford and then worked in Bramhall for the Famous Players.<ref name=guardobit/> There he met actor Glenn Melvyn; the two became firm friends and Barker stated Melvyn taught him everything he "ever learned about comedy."<ref>{{harvnb McCabe 2005 p=31}}</ref>

He joined the Oxford Playhouse in 1951 and worked there for three years, appearing in plays such as He Who Gets Slapped as the clown.<ref name=guardobit/> Peter Hall (theatre director) Peter Hall worked with Barker at Oxford and gave him his break, casting him as the Chantyman and Joe Silva in his production of Mourning Becomes Electra at the Arts Theatre in West End theatre Londons West End in 1955.<ref name=timesobit/><ref name=indobit/> By the time he had made it to the West End, Barker had appeared in an estimated 350 plays.<ref name=C39/> Barker remained a West End actor for several years, appearing in numerous plays between 1955 and 1968. These included, in 1955, two performances each night as he played a gypsy in Listen to the Wind at the Arts Theatre and then a peasant in Summertime later in the evening.<ref name=C44>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=44–45}}</ref> Other roles included Mr Thwaites in Double Image in 1956 (with Olivier), Camino Real (play) Camino Real (directed by Hall) in 1957,<ref name=C44/> French gangster Robertoles-Diams in Irma La Douce (musical) Irma La Douce for two years from 1958,<ref name=C2/> Lord Slingsby-Craddock in Mr Whatnot in 1964 and Birdboot in The Real Inspector Hound in 1968. He also appeared in several Royal Court Theatre productions, including A Midsummer Nights Dream as Quince.<ref name=indobit/>

===Early media career===
Barkers theatrical success enabled him to move into radio work. Barker, who had previously been known by his birth name "Ronald", was now referred to as the less formal form "Ronnie", after a director changed it in the credits, although he did not tell Barker.<ref name=indobit/> His first radio appearance was in 1956, playing Lord Russett in Floggits.<ref name=indobit/> He went on to play multiple characters, but primarily the put-upon Able Seaman Fatso Johnson and Lieutenant-Commander Stanton in The Navy Lark, a navy based sitcom on the BBC Radio 2 BBC Light Programme, which ran from 1959-77, with Barker featuring in some 300 episodes.<ref name=indobit/><ref name=bbcobit>{{cite news url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/473779.stm title=Obituary: Ronnie Barker publisher=BBC News date=4 October 2005 accessdate=13 April 2010}}</ref> 

He also featured in the shows radio spin-off The TV Lark, in which his character, Fatso, was now a camera operator after the main characters were drummed out of the service, and as a trainee chef in Crowthers Crowd in 1963,<ref name=indobit/> and had roles on Variety Playhouse.<ref name=C5>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=5}}</ref> Barker soon began working in film and television. His first acting job on television was in Melvyns show Im Not Bothered.<ref name=M32>{{harvnb McCabe 2005 p=32}}</ref> He appeared in various roles in the comedy series Faces of Jim The Seven Faces of Jim from 1962, alongside Jimmy Edwards and June Whitfield, as well as parts in Bold as Brass and Foreign Affairs (1966 TV series) Foreign Affairs (as Russian embassy worker Grischa Petrovitch).<ref name=C56/> This was followed with dramatic parts in A Tale of Two Cities as Jerry Cruncher in 1965 as well as single episode roles in The Saint (TV series) The Saint and The Avengers (TV series) The Avengers, in which he played Cheshire, a cat lover.<ref name=C56>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=56}}</ref> 

In 1964 he appeared in Galton & Simpsons Gentleness gentle comedy, The Bargee, as Ronnie, the illiterate cousin of Harry H Corbetts rascally Hemmel Pike.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057872/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl The Bargee (1964) - Plot Summary], imdb.com; accessed 24 January 2018.</ref> He did his first bit of on-screen porridge as fellow convict to Charlie Drake in The Cracksman (1963).<ref>{{cite web title=The Cracksman url=http://www.prisonmovies.net/the-cracksman-1963-uk website=Prison Movies accessdate=19 January 2018}}</ref> Other film work at that time included: Doctor in Distress (film) Doctor in Distress (1963), Father Came Too! (1963) and A Home of Your Own (1965).<ref name=indobit/><ref name=guardobit/>

In 1966, Barker got his break with the satirical sketch series The Frost Report, having been recommended for the show by producer James Gilbert (producer) James Gilbert.<ref name=C5/> The show starred David Frost, John Cleese and Barkers future comedy partner Ronnie Corbett, whom he had met in 1963 when Corbett was the barman at the Buckstone Club near the Haymarket Theatre,<ref name=C2>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=2}}</ref> and the two became friends. 

Corbett stated in his autobiography that the two had gravitated towards each other because of their similar backgrounds; neither had attended university, while many of the other Frost Report cast and writers had.<ref name=C13/> Each episode of the show, which was performed and broadcast live, was focused on a single topic and principally revolved around a continuous monologue from Frost, with sketches from Barker, Corbett and Cleese as the show went on.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=51}}</ref> Barker starred alongside Cleese and Corbett in The Frost Report<nowiki></nowiki>s Class sketch best known sketch, which satirised the Social structure of Britain British class system, with Barker representing the middle class.<ref name=C13>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=13}}</ref>

After the first series, the special Frost Over England was produced, winning the Rose dOr Golden Rose at the Montreux Television Festival.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=52}}</ref> With a second series of the show announced, Frost, recognising their potential, signed both Barker and Corbett up to his production company David Paradine Productions.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=53}}</ref> As part of the deal Barker was given his own show in 1968, The Ronnie Barker Playhouse, which comprised six separate, thirty-minute plays. Barker starred in each piece as a different character.<ref name=C55>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=55}}</ref> 

After two series of The Frost Report on the BBC, totaling 26 half-hour episodes, Frost moved to ITV (TV network) ITV after helping to set up London Weekend Television. There, Frost hosted Frost on Sunday, with Barker and Corbett following and again performing sketches on the program.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=58}}</ref> Barker began writing sketches for the programme under the pseudonym Gerald Wiley.<ref name=timesobit/> Barker and Corbett had a greater role on the show than on The Frost Report and Corbett felt "more aware of what [they] were doing."<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=63}}</ref>

Barker began using the pseudonym Gerald Wiley when writing sketches because he wished the pieces to be accepted on merit and not just because he, as a star of the programme, had written them; he continued this tradition with the material he wrote later in his career.<ref name=indobit/> Barker brought his sketches in, claiming they had come from Wiley through Barkers agent Peter Eade, and they were very well received. To maintain the deception, Barker had criticised material he himself had submitted under the pseudonym; when a Wiley-credited sketch about a ventriloquist had been poorly received by the audience Barker told Corbett "Well, Gerald Wiley let us down there", and on another occasion, when looking at a script, "I dont understand this line. Whats he getting at?"<ref name=C67/> One of the first sketches he wrote was called "Doctors Waiting Room", with the main part written for Corbett. Barker encouraged Corbett to buy the rights to the sketch and, further maintaining the myth, told him to reject Wileys request for £3,000 as too expensive, before giving Corbett the sketch for free.<ref name=C67/> 

Speculation began about Wileys identity, with Tom Stoppard, Frank Muir, Alan Bennett and Noël Coward all rumoured. After the second series of Frost on Sunday, the cast and crew were invited to a Chinese restaurant, while Wiley said that he would reveal himself. Barker, who had told Corbett earlier in the day, stood up and announced he was Wiley, although initially nobody believed him.<ref name=C67>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=67–72}}</ref>

In 1969 Barker was able to write, produce and star as General Futtock in the film Futtocks End which featured no dialogue and only "grumble[s] and grunt[s]".<ref name=timesobit/><ref name=indobit/> The Ronnie Barker Playhouse had been designed to find a successful idea for a sitcom, and the episode "Ah, There You Are" by Alun Owen, which introduced the bumbling aristocratic character Lord Rustless, was chosen.<ref name=indobit/><ref name=C55/> The character returned for the 1969–1970 series Hark at Barker as the main character; Barker wrote for the show under the name Jonathan Cobbald.<ref name=indobit/> As Wiley he wrote the 1971 series Six Dates with Barker.<ref name=indobit/> Despite Barkers success on ITV, LWTs programme controller Stella Richman opted to fire Frosts company Paradine (Frost was sacked from the LWT board) and as Barker was contracted to the company rather than the network, he lost his job, as did Corbett.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=73}}</ref>

===Move to the BBC and The Two Ronnies===
Soon after, Barker, Corbett and Josephine Tewson performed a sketch about Henry VIII of England Henry VIII at the 1971 British Academy Television Awards BAFTAs, with Barker playing Henry. The two also had to keep the audience entertained for eight or so minutes as the show was stopped because of technical difficulties. Their performance at the award show impressed the BBCs Head of Light Entertainment Bill Cotton and Controller of BBC One Paul Fox (television executive) Paul Fox, who were sitting in the audience. Not knowing they were both essentially unemployed, although still contracted to Paradine, Cotton signed the duo up for their own show together, and a series each on their own; he later joked he "must have offered them too much money."<ref name=indobit/><ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=74–75}}</ref> Barker and Corbett wished to avoid being remembered primarily as a duo, and felt they could not work in the same way as a conventional double act like Morecambe and Wise, and so each maintained their solo careers as well.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=77}}</ref> They each were given a one-off variety special; Barkers, called The Ronnie Barker Yearbook, featured a sketch for each month of the year, although because of time constraints the first two had to be cut.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=84}}</ref> Barker also reprised his character Lord Rustless in the sitcom His Lordship Entertains in 1972.<ref name=indobit/> Barker wrote all seven episodes, again with the pseudonym Jonathan Cobbald.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/h/hislordshipenter_66600370.shtml  title=His Lordship Entertains publisher=BBC author=Mark Lewisohn accessdate=13 April 2010  archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040522160514/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/h/hislordshipenter_66600370.shtml  archivedate = 22 May 2004}}</ref>

Their show together was The Two Ronnies, a sketch show which aired for twelve series and eight specials between 1971 and 1987, to immediate success.<ref name=bbcobit/> The show, as described by Anthony Hayward of The Independent, was "a cocktail of comedy sketches, playlets, songs and parodies, a long-winded Corbett monologue and a singing star, sandwiched between the opening and closing news summaries."<ref name=indobit/> The usual format consisted of many sketches between the two, an ongoing filmed serial, a solo character sketch from Barker, Corbetts monologue, a musical number, a special guest, bookended by joke news items, delivered from a desk by the two in the style of News presenter newsreaders, before ending with the catchphrase "Its good night from me – and its good night from him."<ref name=timesobit/> This was a set format which was used for almost the entirety of the shows run.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=86–89}}</ref> The end catchphrase and newsreader characters were devised because Barker found it difficult to appear as himself: Corbett explained that Barker "was a very private man, a quiet man ... He found it almost impossible to talk directly, as himself, to an audience."<ref name=C78>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=78}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=80}}</ref> Each also had their own solo segments to help ensure they were not totally associated as a double act.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=79}}</ref> Filming took place over four months of each year.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=95}}</ref> After outdoor and serial sketches were filmed on location, the studio material was filmed on Sunday evenings at BBC Television Centre in front a live audience; the musical finale was filmed the day before without the audience.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=123}}</ref>

Barker wrote much of the shows material, roughly three-quarters, again under the name Gerald Wiley.<ref name=indobit/> He was heavily involved with the shows production, especially the serial. Corbett explained that Barker was a "perfectionist" and "as he wrote it Ronnie knew how he wanted every shot to look."<ref name=C98>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=98–99}}</ref> After filming the show all day, he spent the evenings helping technician Jim Franklin edit it.<ref name=C98/> While filming on location Barker and Corbett would look through all of the potential material for the studio recording of the rest of the shows content and decide on the running order.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=109–111}}</ref> He and Corbett always got on, with Barker noting "People refuse to believe that we dont have rows, tensions, private wars. Its a strange thing after so many years but we never have. Actually, its even more amicable than a marriage – wedlock without the bad patches. Our sense of humour and perception of whats good and whats rubbish are uncommonly in tune."<ref name=indobit/> They took turns to play the parts which had the "good lines".<ref name=timesobit/> One of the shows other writers, Barry Cryer, said: "You could write almost anything knowing these two would do it brilliantly. Because they werent a double act; they were two men who worked together and had their own careers."<ref name=indobit/>

Barkers material included the sketch which came to be known as "Four Candles", airing in 1976, although in the original script it was entitled "Annie Finkhouse".<ref name=four/> It sees a customer (Barker) ask for a series of items in a hardware store. The sketchs humour derives from similarities in word pronunciation, leading to confusion on the part of the store owner (Corbett). These misunderstandings include the confusion between "four candles" and "fork handles".<ref name=four/> The idea for the sketch came from the owners of a hardware shop in Hayes, Hillingdon who wrote in to The Two Ronnies to describe some of the amusing events and misunderstandings in their store.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=179}}</ref> Barker was never happy with the sketchs final line (a male assistant asking "What sort of billhooks did you want?") and changed it (to a female assistant asking "What sort of knockers were you looking for?") for the stage version of The Two Ronnies, although he was still not totally satisfied with it.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=183}}</ref> Nevertheless, the sketch is considered the shows most famous one and was voted as the shows best in a TV special,<ref name=four>{{cite news url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7155024.stm title=Fork handles script makes £48,500 publisher=BBC News accessdate=13 April 2010 date=20 December 2007}}</ref> while also placing fifth on Channel 4s 50 Greatest Comedy Sketches.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/comedy_sketches/results.html title=50 Greatest Comedy Sketches publisher=Channel 4 accessdate=13 April 2010  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527085445/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/comedy_sketches/results.html  archivedate=27 May 2008}}</ref> The original script, hand-written by Barker, was sold for £48,500 at auction in 2007 after being featured on an episode of Antiques Roadshow the previous year.<ref name=four/>

After a tip-off from Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, Barker and Corbett opted to move with their families to Sydney, Australia in 1979 for the year to exploit a tax loophole and avoid paying the years income tax. They performed their stage show for four weeks in Sydney and a further four in Melbourne; because of their existing popularity in Australia and, what Corbett terms, the Australian audiences "[comedic] soul that still related to the UK," they made no changes to the routine. Barker made no other appearances that year and spent his time writing and engaging in recreational activities.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=193–201}}</ref> Following the shows success, Kerry Packer commissioned a six episode TV series of The Two Ronnies in Australia for Nine Network. The show comprised material not yet shown in Australia from The Two Ronnies and new content targeted more towards an Australian audience.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=203–206}}</ref> They returned for a second series in 1986.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=240}}</ref>

Barker and Corbett also starred in the short, mostly silent, films The Picnic (1975) and By the Sea (1982 film) By the Sea (1982).<ref name=indobit/> By the Sea was Barkers tribute to the seaside postcard humour of Donald McGill and his most "personal" work.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=217}}</ref> The show was also widely syndicated in North America by PBS and CBC, and in 1980 they appeared in the short-lived NBC variety show The Big Show (TV series) The Big Show; the two were glad the show did not last as they objected to the use of canned laughter by the American networks.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=133–134}}</ref>

===Porridge, Open All Hours and other work===
Following the success of The Two Ronnies, the BBC let Barker decide what he wanted to do.<ref name=timesobit/> The Two Ronnies took up one third of a year to produce, allowing time for Barker and Corbett to do a solo project each.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=148–149}}</ref>  Barker opted to produce some sitcom pilots shown as part of 1973s Seven of One. Two of these pilots, Open All Hours (written by Roy Clarke) and Prisoner and Escort (written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais) became series. Prisoner and Escort became Porridge (TV series) Porridge, airing from 1974–1977, with Barker starring as the cynical and cunning prisoner Norman Stanley Fletcher. Porridge was the first sitcom to take place in a prison; The Times said the show "was about what it took to survive in prison, the little day-to-day triumphs over the system that kept the prisoners sane."<ref name=timesobit/> The opening sequence of the programme showed Fletcher being directed to his cell, as prison doors are locked behind him, all the while the judge can be heard pronouncing judgement and sentence. The judges voice was performed by Barker.

In 1976, Barker played Friar Tuck in the film Robin and Marian, directed by Richard Lester.<ref name=indobit/> The same year, determined not to be remembered only as Fletcher, Barker opted to end Porridge after two series and instead focused on the second pilot Open All Hours, alongside David Jason. Barker starred as Arkwright, a money-grabbing, stuttering shopkeeper.<ref name=timesobit/> Arkwrights stutter was not in the script; Barker was inspired to use it by Melvyns performance and use of a stutter in a 1955 play the two performed at the Palace Theatre, London Palace Theatre called Hot Water.<ref name=M32/> Open All Hours aired one series in 1976 on BBC Two but was not renewed due to low ratings.<ref name=timesobit/> As a result, Barker backtracked on his earlier decision and produced a third series of Porridge, as well as a Porridge (film) film adaptation. It was followed by the spin-off sitcom Going Straight which focused on Fletcher after his release from prison.

He joked: "I lose money every week, but its a hobby. Its cheaper than skiing and safer at my age."<ref name=timesobit/> Because of its unprofitability, the shop was sold after ten years.<ref name=c254/> He wrote his autobiography, Dancing in the Moonlight: My Early Years on Stage in 1993 and released All I Ever Wrote, his complete scripts, in 1999.<ref name=timesobit/> He wrote the play Mum for his daughter Charlotte Barker in 1998, which was performed at The Kings Head Theatre, but garnered a negative response, with Barker stating it got "the worst notices of any play in the history of the theatre."<ref name=timesobit/><ref name=indobit/>

Just over a decade after retiring, Barker was persuaded to make occasional appearances on television again. In 1997 he appeared with Corbett at the Royal Command Performance, driving on stage in a motorcycle as the Two Fat Ladies,<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=269–269}}</ref> and in 1999 he was reunited with Corbett for Two Ronnies Night on BBC One, and the following year for A Tribute to the Two Ronnies.<ref name=indobit/> In 2002, director Richard Loncraine persuaded Barker to appear as Winston Churchills butler David Inches in the BBC-HBO drama The Gathering Storm (2002) The Gathering Storm and then cast him in the larger role of the General in the TV film My House in Umbria in 2003, alongside Maggie Smith (whom he had, early in their careers, advised to give up acting as he felt she would not be a success).<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=262–263}}</ref>  In the same year, he briefly reprised his role as Norman Stanley Fletcher in the spoof documentary Life Beyond the Box: Norman Stanley Fletcher Life Beyond the Box.<ref>{{cite web url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/782867 title=Life Beyond the Box Norman Stanley Fletcher publisher=British Film Institute accessdate=13 April 2010}}</ref>

Barker received several lifetime achievement awards. He won the Royal Television Societys award for Outstanding Creative Achievement in 1975.<ref name=bbcobit/> Alec Guinness Sir Alec Guinness presented him with a lifetime achievement honour at the inaugural British Comedy Awards in 1990, while he received another such honour at the BBC Centenary Programme in 1996.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=266–67}}</ref> In 2004 he was given a special BAFTA lifetime achievement award at Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute, a televised celebratory tribute evening.<ref name=bbcobit/> In 2005, he and Corbett were part of the first 100 people given stars on Avenue of Stars, London Londons Avenue of Stars.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=287–288}}</ref> Previous awards included the Variety, the Childrens Charity Variety Club of Great Britain Award in 1969, 1974 and 1980, the Radio Industry Club Award in 1973, 1974, 1977 and 1981.<ref name=guardobit/>

Following the success of Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute, Barker wanted to return The Two Ronnies to television and the BBC commissioned The Two Ronnies Sketchbook, a clip show of their best sketches along with newly recorded introductions. These were recorded in one day due to Barkers declining health and aired in 2005.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=278}}</ref> The project, when announced, met with "some derision among the professional critics", but after the first episode drew eight million viewers, they had to "eat their words".<ref name=indobit/><ref name=bbcobit/>  The final special, and Barkers final appearance on television – The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook – was recorded in July 2005 as a result of Barkers failing health and aired posthumously in December.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=285–286}}</ref>

==Acting and writing style==

Barker became a comic actor in his theatre days, noting "I think its better to make people laugh than cry."<ref name=timesobit/> He has been described by The Times as "not a comedian, [but] an actor with a talent for comedy," who "slipped into characters with apparent ease."<ref name=timesobit/> Barker felt he was funny only in character.<ref name=timesobit/> The BBC wrote of him:  "Able to deliver the great tongue-twisting speeches required of his characters, Barker pronounced himself completely boring without a script."<ref name=bbcobit/> Peter Hall (director) Peter Hall spoke of Barkers skills as a dramatic actor, calling him "the great actor we lost" and lamented that Barker was unable to take a role in one of his Shakespearean productions.<ref name=C236>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 p=236}}</ref> Barker, though, preferred comedy,<ref name=C39/> and felt it was "as good and as important as serious work" and he was not "dumbing down" by doing it.<ref name=C236/> Actor Gene Wilder compared him to Charlie Chaplin in saying "no matter how farcical [his performance] was ... there was always an element of reality to what he did."<ref name=baftatrib>{{Cite episode title=Ronnie Barker: A BAFTA Tribute credits=Presenter: Ronnie Corbett network=BBC station=BBC One location=London, England airdate=2004-02-07}}</ref> Corbett praised Barkers skill at playing serious authority figures saying absurd things, using Barkers verbal dexterity and energetic performances.<ref>{{harvnb Corbett Nobbs 2007 pp=229–232}}</ref>

Barkers writing style was, for The Times, "based on precise scripts and perfect timing." It often involved playing with language, including humour involving such linguistic items as spoonerisms and double entendres.<ref name=timesobit/> Dennis Baker of The Guardian wrote that Barker "preferred innuendo over the crudely explicit, a restraint that demanded some imagination from the audience and was the essence of his comedy."<ref name=guardobit/> Corbett said he had "a mastery of the English language".<ref name=C39/>

In private, he annotated a copy of A Book of Nonsense by Edward Lear, penning punch lines of his own for each limerick. On the title page he wrote, "There was an old fossil named Lear, Whose verses were boring and drear. His last lines were worst – just the same as the first! So Ive tried to improve on them here." The annotated copy of Lears book, signed and dated November 2001, was auctioned in 2012.<ref>{{cite web title=Ronnie Barker rewrote boring book of Lear limericks url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18421603 publisher=BBC News accessdate=28 September 2012 date=13 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web title=Ronnie Barkers Edward Lear book fetches £3,600 at auction url=http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/Ronnie-Barker-s-Edward-Lear-book-fetches-3-600/story-16429147-detail/story.html publisher=thisisgloucestershire.co.uk accessdate=28 September 2012 date=21 June 2012 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623071111/http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/Ronnie-Barker-s-Edward-Lear-book-fetches-3-600/story-16429147-detail/story.html archivedate=23 June 2012 df=dmy-all}}</ref>
