Joseph Timothy "Tim" Thomerson (born April 8, 1946) is an American actor and comedian.
Thomerson is most famous for his role as Jack Deth in the Trancers
film series and is renowned for his work in numerous low-budget movies and his comedic television roles.
==Early life==
Tim Thomerson was born in Coronado, California. He was brought up in Hawaii and in San Diego. Following a stint in the National Guard of the United States National Guard
<!--note, no hint that he served on active duty or in Vietnam-->
where he was with actor Brion James, Thomerson chose to become an actor, while taking a job as a set builder and prop man at the Old Globe Theatre, which is famous for its Shakespearean productions. After meeting character actor Anthony Zerbe, he took Anthonys advice and studied acting, at the Herpolscheimer School of Performing Arts, with Stella Adler in New York City.

After his college tenure had ended, Thomerson began a career as a stand-up comedian, honing his skills. He appeared in clubs that included The Bitter End in Greenwich Village, The Improv in Los Angeles, Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs) Catch a Rising Star, and the Catskills.

==Career==
When Thomerson moved into comedy, he found himself in a boom alongside the likes of David Letterman, Jay Leno, and Freddie Prinze. In L.A., he became a regular at the Comedy Store and the Improv as well as making numerous appearances on television variety shows and in Las Vegas Valley Las Vegas.

Thomerson has had a very long career in television and in film, appearing in scores of films since the 1970s. He had a memorable minor role in Car Wash (film) Car Wash.
He played criminal psychologist Jerry Moriarity in the 1980 slasher film Fade to Black (1980 film) Fade to Black.

In 1985, Thomerson starred as the time-traveling future cop Jack Deth in the low budget science fiction film Trancers which was produced by Charles Band and Empire Pictures. The role made him an icon of the B-movie genre, and led to Thomerson building a working relationship with the Bands. He was supposed to appear in Pulse Pounders which was ultimately never completed.

In 1986, Thomerson would reunite with a few of his Trancers co-stars for Zone Troopers, and he appeared in the vampire film Near Dark. He also appeared as a villain opposite Melanie Griffiths heroine in Cherry 2000 and as Major Dan Hackett in the Disney made-for-TV movie, The B.R.A.T. Patrol starring opposite Sean Astin, Nia Long and Brian Keith.

When Charles Band started up Full Moon Features in the late 1980s, one of his first projects was Trancers II (released in 1991), in which he reunited Thomerson with much of the cast from the first film. Thomerson would appear in every sequel thereafter, with the exception of Trancers 6, which instead starred Zette Sullivan in her only lead role, and used archive footage of Thomerson to enhance the story. Thomerson is considering returning in another Trancers sequel.

He appeared in NBCs 1988 television film The Incredible Hulk Returns as Hulk (comics) The Hulks opponent, Jack LeBeau.

Another movie role that made Thomerson popular with fans of science-fiction was that of Brick Bardo in the 1991 film Dollman (film) Dollman, a Dirty Harry-like alien cop who is 13 inches tall, and uses his blaster gun to take on gangsters and devil-possessed toys in two obscure feature films. The character also appeared very briefly in Bad Channels.

Thomerson has had many memorable roles in feature films, including Uncommon Valor, Air America (film) Air America, Volunteers (film) Volunteers, Whos Harry Crumb?, Iron Eagle, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film) Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, just to name a few, as well as numerous television roles such as Tour of Duty (TV series) Tour of Duty and 21 Jump Street. He also played Colonel Savage of the Missouri Militia on The Young Riders in 1989. In the 90s he was a series regular on the television police drama Sirens (1993 TV series) Sirens followed by a regular, co-starring role on the series Lands End (TV series) Lands End starring Fred Dryer.

Thomerson has been fortunate enough to have worked with some of his favorite actors, which include Gene Hackman, Clint Eastwood, Wilford Brimley, and Richard Farnsworth. His personal comic hero is Richard Pryor.

===Initial success===
One of Thomersons early acting breaks came from director Robert Altman who, after seeing Thomersons stand-up act, cast him in the film A Wedding. At this early stage of Thomersons movie career he found himself surrounded by the likes of Vittorio Gassman, Carol Burnett, Geraldine Chaplin, and a very young Dennis Franz.

Thomerson first came to prominence in the short-lived comedy science-fiction TV series Quark (TV series) Quark in 1977–78, as Gene/Jean, a character of dual gender who randomly switched from a macho to a feminine personality.

Thomersons most famous role is that of Jack Deth, the hero of Charles Bands Trancers series. Playing against his comedic roots, Thomerson played Deth as a hard-nosed epitome of machismo, like the science fiction equivalent of Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry series.  The character continued in four more sequels throughout the 1990s. A fifth sequel, Trancers 6, was released in 2002 but Thomerson was not involved.

Other career highlights include Babo in the adventure film Air America (film) Air America with Mel Gibson and Robert Downey, Jr., grimy mercenary Rhodes in Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn, demented cult leader Lester in Cherry 2000, Loy in the horror classic Near Dark, diminutive lawman Brick Bardo in Dollman (film) Dollman and Dollman vs. Demonic Toys, and a scruffy motorcyclist in Terry Gilliams Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film) Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Thomerson is a stock player in the films of actor/director Michael Worth (DUAL, Devil On The Mountain Devil on the Mountain, Gods Ears) and a favorite of director Albert Pyun (Dollman (film) Dollman, Knights (film) Knights, Nemesis (1992 film) Nemesis, Nemesis 3: Prey Harder).

In addition, Thomerson has made guest appearances on TV shows such as The Golden Girls, Walker, Texas Ranger, The Young Riders, Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, Xena, Warrior Princess, Viper (TV series) Viper, The District, and Silk Stalkings.

Most recently he had voiced the Voice of Freedom for the John Milius-written video game Homefront (video game) Homefront and Cyrus Temple in Saints Row: The Third.

===Personal life===
Thomersons wife Teri Blythe has worked extensively in Hollywood as a script supervisor, make-up artist, casting director, and producer.{{citation needed date=December 2015}}
