On May 5, 2005, Rosato was arrested and Indictment charged with criminal harassment of his wife Leah, who asserted that his mental illness deteriorating mental health had caused her to fear for her safety and that of the couples infant daughter.<ref name=jokester>{{cite news  url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/05/13/from_jokester_to_jailbird.html  title=From jokester to jailbird  last=Freed  first=Dale Anne  date=May 13, 2007  newspaper=Toronto Star  access-date=January 11, 2017 via=}}</ref> The charge was laid after Rosato complained repeatedly to Toronto and Kingston, Ontario Kingston police that his wife, who had recently left him, and daughter had been abducted and replaced by impostors, a belief characteristic of Capgras delusion, a delusional misidentification syndrome with which the Crown attorney Crowns expert psychiatrist had diagnosed Rosato, according to Rosatos eighth lawyer, Daniel Brodsky. It was alleged that the harassment occurred from December 28, 2003 and escalated until April 21, 2005. In spite of the diagnosis, Rosato, who denied mental illness and refused to Insanity defense plead insanity, was held for over two years without bail at a maximum-security detention centre. Brodsky, who called his clients two-year detention awaiting trial "shocking," asserted that Rosato "spent more time in custody on a harassment charge" than anyone ever convicted of the offence in Canada, estimating that "on average, someone convicted of criminal harassment spends one day in jail and two years on probation." The trial finally commenced on August 7, 2007, in Kingston and it ended on September 5. In the end, the prosecution downgraded the charge to a summary offence from an indictable offence. Rosato was spared a criminal conviction and handed a conditional discharge, including a psychiatric hospital residence order, issued for a maximum of three years, of which he ended up serving 19 months.
