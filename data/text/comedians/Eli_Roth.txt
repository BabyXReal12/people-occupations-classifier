Eli Raphael Roth (born April 18, 1972) is an American film director, producer, writer, and actor. As a director and producer, he is most closely associated with the Horror film horror genre, first coming to prominence for directing the 2005 films Hostel (2005 film) Hostel and Hostel: Part II.  

As an actor, Roths most prominent role has been as Donny "The Bear Jew" Donowitz in Quentin Tarantinos war film Inglourious Basterds for which he won both a SAG Award (Best Ensemble) and a BFCA Critics Choice Award (Best Acting Ensemble). Journalists have included him in a group of filmmakers dubbed the Splat Pack for their explicitly violent and bloody horror films.
In 2013, Roth received the Visionary Award for his contributions to horror, at the Stanley Film Festival. He directed the 2015 erotic thriller film Knock Knock (2015 film) Knock Knock and the 2018 action film Death Wish (2018 film) Death Wish, a remake of the Death Wish (1974 film) 1974 original.
==Early life==
Roth was born in Newton, Massachusetts Newton, Massachusetts, to Sheldon Roth, a psychiatrist/psychoanalyst and clinical professor at Harvard Medical School, and Cora Roth, a painter.
Roth was raised Jewish (his family is from Austria, Hungary, Russia, and Poland).
In addition to English, he speaks French, Italian, and Russian.
Roth began shooting films at the age of eight, after watching Ridley Scotts Alien (film) Alien (1979).
He and his brothers Adam and Gabriel
made over 100 short films before he graduated from Newton South High School and attended film school (the Tisch School of the Arts) at New York University. To fund his films while in college Roth worked as an online cybersex operator for Penthouse Magazine, posing as a woman, as well as a production assistant on feature films.
Roth also ran the office of producer Frederick Zollo,
leaving after graduation to devote himself to writing full-time. He collected unemployment and found work on Howard Sterns Private Parts (1997 film) Private Parts as Sterns assistant, staying at Silvercup Studios in Queens at night working on his scripts while Stern slept.

Actress Camryn Manheim gave Roth one of his first Hollywood jobs, as an extra on The Practice, when he moved to Los Angeles. Roth would stay in Manheims dressing room, working on his scripts, while she filmed the show. The two had become friends in New York, while Roth was working fo Zollo.  Roth also met Manheims cousin Howie Nuchow (former EVP of Mandalay Sports Entertainment and also from the Boston area) at her family Passover seder—this led to Roths first animation project, "Chowdaheads", the following year. Roth also co-wrote a project called "The Extra" with Manheim,
who later sold the pitch to producer (and former CEO and Chairman of Fox Studios) Bill Mechanics Pandemonium company.

==Film career==
At NYU film school, Roth wrote and directed a student film called Restaurant Dogs, an homage to Quentin Tarantinos Reservoir Dogs. The film was nominated for a Student Academy Award in 1995, ultimately winning its division (Division III).

Through his internship with Frederick Zollo, Roth met David Lynch and remained in touch over the years, eventually producing content for Lynch with his fledgling website in the late 1990s.
Through Lynch, Roth met film and TV composer Angelo Badalamenti, whose music he used in his first feature film. He also met a member of special effects company KNB EFX, which contributed to his first feature.

In 1999, Roth moved to LA, where he wrote, directed, edited, produced, animated, and provided some voices for a series of animated shorts called Chowdaheads for Mandalay Sports Entertainment. They were to be shown between WCW Monday Nitro pro wrestling matches, but Eric Bischoff the C.E.O. of WCW who had green-lit the project was fired the weekend before they were to air, so they were finished but never actually broadcast. Roths friend Noah Belson co-wrote the shorts and provided the other character voices.
In mid-2000, with financing from the website Z.com to deliver a 5-minute pilot, Roth wrote, directed, animated and produced a series of Stop motion stop-motion shorts called The Rotten Fruit.
The company folded after several episodes were done, and its domain name was picked up by Nissan for its "Z" sports car. A portion of Roths work for The Rotten Fruit was done at the Snake Pit studios in Burbank with miniature sets, poseable clay, and foam figures, two high-end digital still cameras, and a pair of Macintosh computers. Noah Belson co-wrote and performed character voices.

===Cabin Fever===
Roth had co-wrote Cabin Fever (2002 film) Cabin Fever in with his college roommate Randy Pearlstein. They based the premise on Roths having contracted a skin infection while riding ponies at a family friends farm in Iceland in 1991.
Much of it was written in 1996, while Roth worked as a production assistant for Howard Sterns movie Private Parts (1997 film) Private Parts.

Cabin Fever was produced in 2001 on a budget of $1.5 million raised from private investors.
The film was sold to Lionsgate at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival for $3.5 million, the biggest sale of that years festival. Released in 2003, it was Lionsgates highest-grossing film of the year, earning $22 million at the U.S. box office and $35 million worldwide.  Lionsgates stock rose from $1.98 a share to nearly $6 a share after the film was released; the company used its new net worth to buy Artisan Entertainment.
Cabin Fever made Roth a star in the horror genre. In a 2004 Premiere Magazine interview, Quentin Tarantino called it "the best new American film".
===Hostel===
In 2005, Roths second feature, Hostel (2005 film) Hostel, was made for just over $4 million. It opened No. 1 at the box office in January 2006, taking in $20 million its first weekend.
The film went on to gross $80 million worldwide in box office, and more than $180 million on DVD. In April 2006, on Roths birthday, the Hostel DVD opened at No. 1.{{Citation needed date=September 2009}} Although the story is set in Slovakia, all the exteriors were shot in the Czech Republic.

In the movie, three friends are lured to visit a hostel where they think their sexual fantasies will come true. Instead, they fall into the clutches of an international syndicate that provides first-hand torture and killing experiences for rich, sadistic tourists. The film was rated No. 1 on Bravo (US TV channel) Bravo TVs 30 Even Scarier Movie Moments,
and Empire Magazine readers voted Hostel the Best Horror Film of 2007.
Roth reportedly turned down studio directing jobs to make Hostel. He took a directing salary of only $10,000 to keep the budget as low as possible, so there would be no limits set on its violence. In January 2006, film critic David Edelstein in New York (magazine) New York magazine credited Roth with creating the horror subgenre "torture porn", or "gorno", using excessive violence to excite audiences like a sexual act.
===Thanksgiving===
In 2007, Roth directed and narrated the faux trailer segment Thanksgiving for Grindhouse (film) Grindhouse as well as appearing in Death Proof, Tarantinos segment of the film. Roth and co-writer Jeff Rendell won a 2007 Spike TV Scream Award for best "screamplay" for their work in Grindhouse, sharing the honor with Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, Rob Zombie and Edgar Wright.
===Hostel: Part II===
File:Deodato - Roth.jpg right thumb 250px Eli Roth with Ruggero Deodato on the set of Hostel: Part II. (2007)
Hostel: Part II opened in sixth place in June 2007, with $8.2 million; it went on to gross $17.6 million in US theaters. The film, which cost $10.2 million, earned $35 million in theaters worldwide and $50 million on DVD and pay television.
Lionsgate attributed the lower grosses to the summer release, opposite blockbusters such as Shrek the Third Shrek 3, Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End and Oceans Thirteen Oceans 13, as well as the films workprint having been leaked online before its release. Close to 2 million illegal workprint downloads were tracked the day Hostel 2 opened.

{{quote I dont know if it was the most downloaded film of all time, but there are tracking services that track what movies are being downloaded. And a copy of Hostel 2 leaked out before its release and they had it, it was like millions and millions of hits. Not only was it downloaded, but in the countries it was downloaded – like Mexico and Brazil – there were copies on the street for practically a penny. You could buy Hostel 2 for a quarter in Mexico City. As a result, in a lot of countries where the piracy was bad, they just didnt even release it.
}}

Hostel Part II was nominated for six Spike TV Scream Awards, including best horror film and best director. It was on Entertainment Weeklys list of the 20 best horror films of the past 20 years.
===Endangered Species===
In 2009, while acting in Inglourious Basterds, Roth said he would soon begin his next film, Endangered Species.
{{quote I cant say anything without giving anything away!… I saw Transformers and Cloverfield and thought, I have an idea for a mass destruction movie. But its going to be very different from those films. And its science fiction, but a little more grounded than that.
}}

In a 2013 interview with The Guardian, Roth indicated that he had suspended work on Endangered Species to focus on 2015s The Green Inferno.
=== The Green Inferno ===
Roth directed the cannibal horror film The Green Inferno (film) The Green Inferno (2013), which was inspired by his love of Mondo horror films such as the infamous Cannibal Holocaust.
===Death Wish===
Roth’s 2018 remake of the film Death Wish opened to $13 million at the box office. The film is centered around a trauma surgeon who turns to vigilantism after his family is attacked. The film was panned by critics "pro-gun propaganda" and ill-timed in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.
Roth defended the movie stating that the movie was not pro-gun and that he wanted the film to focus on family, protecting ones family and seeking justice for your family.

==== Film ====
In 2002, Roth brought a shot-for-shot remake by kids of Raiders of the Lost Ark to the attention of both Harry Knowles and Steven Spielberg. Hed had a copy in his video collection for years, and showed it at Knowles Butt-Numb-A-Thon film festival in December. The response was so great that Roth took the tape to his first meeting at DreamWorks Pictures DreamWorks to give to Spielberg. An executive called the next week saying Spielberg loved it and wanted to contact the filmmakers. Roth had never met them, but Google-searched every name in the credits until he found Jayson Lamb, the cinematographer. The three filmmakers—Lamb, Chris Strompolis and Eric Zala (a former Activision employee) -- hadnt spoken to each other in years when Roth contacted them. Roth, feeling their film was so powerful he had to do whatever he could to make sure fans saw it, introduced it at its premiere at Graumans Chinese Theatre in May 2008, five and a half years after he first gave the tape to Knowles.  Soon, the three reunited friends were touring the world, doing charity screenings.File:Eli Roth 2007.jpg thumb left 170px Roth at the Spike TV Scream Awards, 2007
In March 2006, Aint It Cool News announced that Dimension Films had bought the rights to the Cell (novel) Cell by Stephen King and would produce a film to be directed by Roth.  In 2009, King finished the screenplay, and actors John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson have since joined the project.

Through his company Arcade, with Eric Newman and Strike producer Marc Abraham,
Roth produced the horror film The Last Exorcism, (originally titled Cotton) which was directed by Daniel Stamm.
Completed in December 2009 and retitled in February 2010, The Last Exorcism
cost $1.5 million to produce. It opened at more than $20 million in U.S. sales, and earned No. #1 opening spots in Canada and the UK. The film had paid for itself when rights in a few foreign territories were sold before shooting began. It earned over $40 million box office in the United States, and $70 million worldwide.
Roth has talked of doing Trailer Trash, another compilation of fake trailers. "Trailer Trash is not a horror film," he said, "its a comedy. It will be very R-rated and completely insane, and Im producing it with Mike Fleiss".
He has also produced the 2012 kung fu film, The Man with the Iron Fist, written, directed, and scored by The RZA, who also stars in the film. According to Roth, Tarantino is involved as well. In an interview with CHUD, Roth said:

{{quote This movie will have everything martial-arts fans could want, combined with RZAs superb musical talent. This project has been his dream for years, and Im thrilled to be a part of it. Fans should know that yes, there will be blood... This aint no PG-13.
}}Roth produced 2014 the American supernatural Horror film Clown (film) Clown and portrayed in a minor role the figure of Frowny the Clown.

Roths role in Quentin Tarantinos segment of 2007 film Grindhouse (film) Grindhouse, Death Proof, came about because Tarantino was impressed by Roths brief part as Justin in Cabin Fever. Roth—who left preproduction on Hostel Part II in Prague and flew to Austin, Texas, to film the scene at the Texas Chili Parlor—said working as an actor for Tarantino is like taking a master class in directing. He quipped that the only directors he would ever act for are people who have won the Palme dOr at the Cannes Film Festival.

Outside of these films and his own, Roth has appeared in a cameo role as a contest emcee in Alexandre Ajas 2010 film Piranha 3-D as well as the 2012 musical film Rock of Ages (2012 film) Rock of Ages, among others.
