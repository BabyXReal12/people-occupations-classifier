In early 1927, Dressler received a lifeline from director Allan Dwan. Although versions differ as to how Dressler and Dwan met, including that Dressler was contemplating suicide, Dwan offered her a part in a film he was planning to make in Florida. The film, The Joy Girl, an early color production, only provided a small part as her scenes were finished in two days, but Dressler returned to New York upbeat after her experience with the production.{{sfn Lee 1997 p=159}}

Later that year, Frances Marion, a screenwriter for the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studio, came to Dresslers rescue. Marion had seen Dressler in the 1925 vaudeville tour and witnessed Dressler at her professional low-point. Dressler had shown great kindness to Marion during the filming of Tillie Wakes Up in 1917, and in return, Marion used her influence with MGMs production chief Irving Thalberg to return Dressler to the screen.{{sfn Silverman 1999 p=23}} Her first MGM feature was The Callahans and the Murphys (1927), a rowdy silent comedy co-starring Dressler (as Ma Callahan) with another former Mack Sennett comedian, Polly Moran, written by Marion.{{sfn Silverman 1999 p=23}}

The film was initially a success, but the portrayal of Irish characters caused a protest in the Irish World newspaper, protests by the American Irish Vigilance Committee, and pickets outside the films New York theatre. The film was first cut by MGM in an attempt to appease the Irish community, then eventually pulled from release after Cardinal Dougherty of the diocese of Philadelphia called MGM president Nicholas Schenck.{{sfn Lee 1997 p=165}} It was not shown again, and the negative and prints may have been destroyed.{{sfn Lee 1997 p=165}} While the film brought Dressler to Hollywood, it did not re-establish her career. Her next appearance was a minor part in the First National Pictures First National film Breakfast at Sunrise. She appeared again with Moran in Bringing Up Father, another film written by Marion.{{sfn Lee 1997 p=166}} Dressler returned to MGM in 1928s The Patsy (1928 film) The Patsy as the mother of the characters played by stars Marion Davies and Jane Winton.{{sfn Lee 1997 p=167}}

Hollywood was converting from silent films, but "Sound film talkies" presented no problems for Dressler, whose rumbling voice could handle both sympathetic scenes and snappy comebacks (the wisecracking stage actress in Chasing Rainbows (1930 film) Chasing Rainbows and the dubious matron in Rudy Vallées Vagabond Lover). Frances Marion persuaded Thalberg to give Dressler the role of Marthy in the 1930 film Anna Christie (1930 film) Anna Christie. Garbo and the critics were impressed by Dresslers acting ability, and so was MGM, which quickly signed her to a $500-per-week contract. Dressler went on to act in comedic films which were popular with movie-goers and a lucrative investment for MGM. She became Hollywoods number-one box-office attraction, and stayed on top until her death in 1934. {{citation needed date=July 2016}}

She also took on serious roles. For Min and Bill, with Wallace Beery, she won the 1930–31 Academy Award for Best Actress (the eligibility years were staggered at that time). She was nominated again for Best Actress for her 1932 starring role in Emma, but lost to Helen Hayes. Dressler followed these successes with more hits in 1933, including the comedy Dinner at Eight (film) Dinner at Eight, in which she played an aging but vivacious former stage actress. Dressler had a memorable bit with Jean Harlow in the film:{{sfn Silverman 1999 p=24}}
<blockquote>
 Harlow: I was reading a book the other day.
 <br/>
 Dressler: Reading a book?
 <br/>
 Harlow: Yes, its all about civilization or something. A nutty kind of a book. Do you know that the guy said that machinery is going to take the place of every profession?
 <br/>
 Dressler: Oh my dear, thats something you need never worry about.
</blockquote>
Following the release of Tugboat Annie (1933), Dressler appeared on the cover of Time (magazine) Time, in its August 7, 1933 issue. MGM held a huge birthday party for Dressler in 1933, broadcast live via radio. Her newly regenerated career came to an abrupt end when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1934. MGM head Louis B. Mayer learned of Dresslers illness from her doctor and reportedly asked that she not be told. To keep her home, he ordered her not to travel on her vacation because he wanted to put her in a new film. Dressler was furious but complied. She appeared in more than 40 films, and achieved her greatest successes in talking pictures made during the last years of her life. The first of her two autobiographies, The Life Story of an Ugly Duckling, was published in 1924; a second book, My Own Story, "as told to Mildred Harrington," appeared a few months after her death.

==Personal life==
Dresslers first marriage was to an American, George Francis Hoeppert (1862 - September 7, 1929), a theatrical manager. His surname is sometimes given as Hopper. According to Dresslers testimony, the couple married in Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1899, although biographer Matthew Kennedy (author) Matthew Kennedy puts the marriage date as May 6, 1894. Some sources indicate Dressler had a daughter who died as a small child, but this has not been confirmed. {{citation needed date=July 2016}}

Her marriage to Hoeppert gave Dressler U.S. citizenship, which was useful later in life, when immigration rules meant permits were needed to work in the United States, and Dressler had to appear before an immigration hearing.
Ever since her start in the theatre, Dressler had sent a portion of her salary to her parents. Her success on Broadway meant she could afford to buy a home and later a farm on Long Island, which she shared with her parents. Dressler made several attempts to set up theatre companies or theatre productions of her own using her Broadway proceeds, but these failed and she had to declare bankruptcy several times.{{sfn Lee 1997 p=70}}

In 1907, Dressler met a Maine businessman, James Henry "Jim" Dalton, who became her companion until his death [Death Record 3104-27934] on November 29, 1921, at the Congress Hotel in Chicago from diabetes. According to Dalton, the two were married in Europe in 1908.{{sfn Lee 1997 p=64}} However, according to Dresslers [http://interactive.ancestrylibrary.com/1174/USM1490_2437-0267?pid=1014722&amp;backurl=http://search.ancestrylibrary.com//cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv%3D1%26db%3DUSpassports%26h%3D1014722%26tid%3D%26pid%3D%26usePUB%3Dtrue%26_phsrc%3DZAa17%26_phstart%3DsuccessSource%26usePUBJs%3Dtrue%26rhSource%3D2542&amp;treeid=&amp;personid=&amp;hintid=&amp;usePUB=true&amp;_phsrc=ZAa17&amp;_phstart=successSource&amp;usePUBJs=true U.S. passport application], the couple married in 1904 in France.

Dressler reportedly later learned that the "minister" who had married them in Monte Carlo was actually a local man paid by Dalton to stage a fake wedding.{{sfn Lee 1997 p=65}} Daltons first wife, Lizzie Augusta Britt Dalton, claimed he
<!-- he (Dalton) or she (Lizzie)?? -->
had not consented to a divorce or been served divorce papers, although Dalton claimed to have divorced her in 1905.{{sfn Lee 1997 p=102}} By 1921, Dalton had become an invalid due to diabetes mellitus, and watched her from the wings in his wheelchair. After his death that year, Dressler was planning for Dalton to be buried as her husband, but Lizzie Dalton had Daltons body returned to be buried in the Dalton family plot.{{sfn Lee 1997 p=148}}

After Daltons death, which coincided with a decline in her stage career, Dressler moved into a servants room in the Ritz Hotel to save money.{{sfn Lee 1997 p=152}} Eventually, she moved in with friend Nella Webb to save on expenses.{{sfn Lee 1997 p=159}} After finding work in film again in 1927, she rented a home in Hollywood on Hillside Avenue. Although Dressler was working from 1927 on, she was still reportedly living hand to mouth. In November 1928, wealthy friends Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Neurmberg gave her $10,000, explaining they planned to give her a legacy someday, but they thought she needed the money then.{{sfn Lee 1997 p=168}} In 1929, she moved to Los Angeles to 6718 Milner Road in Whitley Heights, then to 623 North Bedford Drive in Beverly Hills, both rentals. She moved to her final home at 801 North Alpine in Beverly Hills in 1932, a home which she bought from the estate of King C. Gillette.{{sfn Lee 1997 p=169}} During her seven years in Hollywood, Dressler lived with her maid Mamie Cox and later Mamies husband Jerry.{{sfn Lee 1997 p=169}}

==Miscellanea==
Although atypical in size for a Hollywood star, Dressler was reported in 1931 to use the services of a "body sculptor to the stars", Sylvia of Hollywood, to keep herself at a steady weight.
Biographers Betty Lee and Matthew Kennedy document Dresslers long-standing friendship with actress Claire Du Brey, whom she met in 1928.{{sfn Kennedy 2006 pp=143-144}} Dressler and Du Breys falling out in 1931 was followed by a later lawsuit by Du Brey, who had been trained as a nurse, claiming back wages as the elder womans nurse.{{citation needed date=July 2016}}

==Death==
On Saturday, July 28, 1934, Dressler died of cancer, aged 65, in Santa Barbara, California. After a private funeral held at The Wee Kirk o’ the Heather chapel, Dressler was interred in a crypt in the Great Mausoleum in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California.
File:Marie Dressler Grave.JPG thumb 150px Marie Dresslers crypt in the Great Mausoleum, Forest Lawn Glendale.
Dressler left an estate worth $310,000, the bulk left to her sister Bonita.
She bestowed her 1931 automobile and $35,000 to her maid of 20 years, Mamie Steele Cox, and $15,000 to Coxs husband, Jerry R. Cox, who had served as Dresslers butler for 4 years.
Dressler intended that the funds should be used to provide a place of comfort for Black travelers,
and the Coxes used the funds to open the Cocoanut Grove night club and adjacent tourist cabins in Savannah, Georgia, in 1936, named after the Cocoanut Grove (Los Angeles) night club in Los Angeles.
==Legacy==
Dresslers birth home in Cobourg, Ontario, is known as Marie Dressler House and is open to the public. The home was converted to a restaurant in 1937 and operated as a restaurant until 1989, when it was damaged by fire. It was restored, but did not open again as a restaurant. It was the office of the Cobourg Chamber of Commerce until its conversion to its current use as a museum about Dressler and as a visitor information office for Cobourg.
Each year, the Marie Dressler Foundation Vintage Film Festival is held, with screenings in Cobourg and in Port Hope, Ontario.
For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Dressler has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1731 Vine Street, added in 1960.
After Min and Bill, Dressler and Beery added their footprints to the cement forecourt of Graumans Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, with the inscription "Americas New Sweethearts, Min and Bill."{{sfn Lee 1997 p=182}}

Canada Post stamp releases (2005-2009) Canada Post, as part of its "Canada in Hollywood" series, issued a postage stamp on June 30, 2008, to honour Marie Dressler.
Dressler is beloved in Seattle. She played in two films based on historical Seattle characters. Tugboat Annie was based on Thea Foss of Seattle. Her character in Politics (1931) was based on Bertha Knight Landes, the first woman mayor of Seattle.
