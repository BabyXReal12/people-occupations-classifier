In a career spanning nine decades and continuing until shortly before his death, he appeared in more than 300 films and was one of the last surviving stars of the silent film era.<ref>[https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2014/04/07/rooney/coAEzsSNMsl3jNIE2EzqNP/story.html "Mickey Rooney, an enduring star"], Boston Globe, April 7, 2014</ref>

At the height of a career that was marked by precipitous declines and raging comebacks, Rooney performed the role of Andy Hardy in a series of 15 films in the 1930s and 1940s that epitomized American family values. A versatile performer, he became a celebrated character actor later in his career. Laurence Olivier once said he considered Rooney "the best there has ever been."<ref name="THR" /> Clarence Brown, who directed him in two of his earliest dramatic roles, National Velvet (film) National Velvet and The Human Comedy (film) The Human Comedy, said he was "the closest thing to a genius I ever worked with."<ref>[http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2014/04/07/iconic-actor-mickey-rooney-dies-at-93 "Iconic Actor Mickey Rooney Dies At 93"], CBS News, April 7, 2014.</ref>

Mayer.

Rooney was the top box-office attraction from 1939 to 1941<ref name="Vanity Fair – April 7, 2014" /> and one of the best-paid actors of that era,<ref name="THR" /> but his career would never again rise to such heights. Conscription Drafted into the Army during World War II, he served nearly two years entertaining over two million troops on stage and radio and was awarded a Bronze Star for performing in combat zones. Returning from the war in 1945, he was too old for juvenile roles but too short to be an adult movie star, and was unable to get as many starring roles. Nevertheless, Rooneys popularity was renewed with well-received supporting roles in films such as Breakfast at Tiffanys (film) Breakfast at Tiffanys (1961), Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962), Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), and The Black Stallion (film) The Black Stallion (1979).

Rooney made hundreds of appearances on TV, including dramas, variety programs, and talk shows, and won an Emmy Awards Emmy in 1964, with another Emmy plus a Golden Globe for his role in Bill (1981 film) Bill (1981).

At his death, Vanity Fair (magazine) Vanity Fair called him "the original Hollywood train wreck."<ref name="Vanity Fair – April 7, 2014">{{cite news last1=Sales first1=Nancy Jo title=Mickey Rooney Blew Through Wives and Fortunes, but God, What a Talent! url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/mickey-rooney-nancy-jo-sales accessdate=January 27, 2015 work=Vanity Fair date=April 7, 2014}}</ref> He struggled with alcohol and pill addiction. Ava Gardner was his first wife, and he would go on to marry an additional seven times. Despite earning millions during his career, he had to file for bankruptcy in 1962 due to mismanagement of his finances. Shortly before his death in 2014 at age 93, he alleged mistreatment by some family members and testified before Congress about what he alleged was physical abuse and exploitation by family members. By the end of his life, his millions in earnings had dwindled to an estate that was valued at only $18,000.

===Andy Hardy, Boys Town and Hollywood stardom===
File:Rooney-Garland-ebay-1938.jpg thumb Rooney with Judy Garland in Love Finds Andy Hardy (1938)
In 1937, Rooney was selected to portray Andy Hardy in A Family Affair (1937 film) A Family Affair, which MGM had planned as a B-movie.<ref name="current" /> Rooney provided comic relief as the son of Judge James K. Hardy, portrayed by Lionel Barrymore (although Lewis Stone would play the role of Judge Hardy in subsequent films). The film was an unexpected success, and led to 13 more Andy Hardy films between 1937 and 1946, and a final film in 1958.

According to author Barry Monush, MGM wanted the Andy Hardy films to appeal to all family members. Rooneys character would portray a typical "anxious, hyperactive, girl-crazy teenager", and he soon became the unintended main star of the films. Although some critics describe the series of films as "sweet, overly idealized, and pretty much interchangeable," their ultimate success was because they gave viewers a "comforting portrait of small-town America that seemed suited for the times", with Rooney instilling "a lasting image of what every parent wished their teen could be like."<ref name=Monush />

Behind the scenes, however, Rooney was like the "hyperactive girl-crazy teenager" he portrayed on the screen. Wallace Beery, his co-star in Stablemates, described him as a "brat", but a "fine actor".<ref>Marx, A. The Nine Lives of Mickey Rooney. Stein and Day (1986), p. 68; {{ISBN 0-8128-3056-3}}.<!-- year of publication?? --></ref> MGM head Louis B. Mayer found it necessary to manage Rooneys public image, explains historian Jane Ellen Wayne:

{{quote Mayer naturally tried to keep all his child actors in line, like any father figure. After one such episode, Mickey Rooney replied, "I wont do it. Youre asking the impossible." Mayer then grabbed young Rooney by his lapels and said, "Listen to me! I dont care what you do in private. Just dont do it in public. In public, behave. Your fans expect it. Youre Andy Hardy! Youre the United States! Youre the Stars and Stripes. Behave yourself! Youre a symbol!" Mickey nodded. "Ill be good, Mr. Mayer. I promise you that." Mayer let go of his lapels, "All right," he said.<ref name=Wayne>Wayne, Jane Ellen. The Leading Men of MGM, Carroll & Graf (2005) p. 246</ref>}}

Fifty years later, Rooney realized in hindsight that these early confrontations with Mayer were necessary for him to develop into a leading film star: "Everybody butted heads with him, but he listened and you listened. And then youd come to an agreement you could both live with.&nbsp;... He visited the sets, he gave people talks&nbsp;... What he wanted was something that was American, presented in a Cosmopolitanism cosmopolitan manner."<ref name=Eyman />{{rp 323}}

Its very, very difficult to explain the depths of our love for each other. It was so special. It was a forever love. Judy, as we speak, has not passed away. Shes always with me in every heartbeat of my body.</blockquote>

In 1937, Rooney received top billing as Shockey Carter in Hoosier Schoolboy but his breakthrough-role as a dramatic actor came in 1938s Boys Town (1938 film) Boys Town opposite Spencer Tracy as Father Flanagan, who runs a home for wayward and homeless boys.

It wasnt all that easy to find roles for a 5-foot-3 man whod passed the age of Andy Hardy."<ref name=marx>{{cite book author=Arthur Marx title=The Nine Lives of Mickey Rooney year=1987 publisher=Berkley location=New York isbn=978-0-425-10552-8}}</ref> In 1962, his debts had forced him into filing for bankruptcy.<ref name=marill>{{cite book last=Marill first=Alvin H. title=Mickey Rooney: His Films, Television Appearances, Radio Work, Stage Shows, And Recordings year=2005 publisher=McFarland location=Jefferson NC isbn=0-7864-2015-4 page=50 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5WZOvH8VSUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

In 1966, Rooney was working on the film Ambush Bay in the Philippines when his wife Barbara Ann Thomason— a former model and aspiring actress who had won 17 straight beauty contests in Southern California—was found dead in her bed. Her lover, Milos Milos—who was one of Rooneys actor-friends—was found dead beside her. Detectives ruled it a murder-suicide, which was committed with Rooneys own gun.<ref name=Lertzman/>{{rp 362}}

Francis Ford Coppola had bought the rights to make The Black Stallion (film) The Black Stallion (1979), and when casting it, he called Rooney and asked him if he thought he could play a jockey. Rooney replied saying, "Gee, I dont know. I never played a jockey before." He was kidding, he said, since he had played a jockey in at least three past films, including Down the Stretch, Thoroughbreds Dont Cry, and National Velvet.<ref name=Lertzman/>{{rp 450}} The film garnered excellent reviews and earned $40 million in its first run, which gave Coppolas struggling studio, American Zoetrope, a major boost. It also gave Rooney newfound recognition, along with a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.<ref name=Lertzman/>{{rp 452}}

Rooney wrote a memoir titled Life is Too Short, published by Villard Books in 1991.

Despite the millions of dollars that he earned over the years, such as his $65,000 a week earnings from Sugar Babies, Rooney was plagued by financial problems late in life. His longtime gambling habit caused him to "gamble away his fortune again and again." He declared bankruptcy for the second time in 1996 and described himself as "broke" in 2005.

==Legacy==
Rooney was one of the last surviving actors of the silent picture era. His movie career spanned 88 years, from 1926 to 2014, continuing until shortly before his death. During his peak years from the late 1930s to the early 1940s, Rooney was among the top box-office stars in the United States.<ref name="Mccartney">{{cite web last=Mccartney first=Anthony url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/04/07/4043993/legendary-star-mickey-rooney-has.html title=Los Angeles: Iconic Hollywood actor Mickey Rooney dies at 93 work=Miami Herald accessdate=April 7, 2014}}</ref>

He made forty-three pictures between the age of 15 and 25. Among those, his role as Andy Hardy became one of "Hollywoods best-loved characters," with Marlon Brando calling him "the best actor in films."<ref name="Monush">Monush, Barry. The Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors, Applause Theatre and Cinema Books (2003) pp. 648–51</ref> For his acting the part in fifteen Andy Hardy films, he received an honorary Oscar in 1938 for "bringing to the screen the spirit and personification of youth" and for "setting a high standard of ability and achievement."<ref name=Basinger />

"There was nothing he couldnt do", said actress Margaret OBrien.<ref name=Mccartney /> MGM boss Louis B. Mayer treated him like a son and saw in Rooney "the embodiment of the amiable American boy who stands for family, humbug, and sentiment," writes critic and author, David Thomson (film critic) David Thomson.<ref name="Thomson">Thomson, David. The New Biographical Dictionary of Film, Alfred A. Knopf (2002) pp. 754–755<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>

By the time Rooney was 20, his consistent portrayals of characters with youth and energy suggested that his future success was unlimited. Thomson also explains that Rooneys characters were able to cover a wide range of emotional types, and gives three examples where "Rooney is not just an actor of genius, but an artist able to maintain a stylized commentary on the demon impulse of the small, belligerent man:"<ref name=Thomson />

{{quote Rooneys Puck in A Midsummer Nights Dream (1935 film) A Midsummer Nights Dream (1935) is truly inhuman, one of cinemas most arresting pieces of magic.&nbsp;... His toughie in Boys Town (1938 film) Boys Town (1938) struts and bullies like something out of a nightmare and then comes clean in a grotesque but utterly frank outburst of sentimentality in which he aspires to the boy community&nbsp;... His role as Baby Face Nelson (film) Baby Face Nelson (1957), the manic, destructive response of the runt against a pig society.<ref name=Thomson />}}

By the end of the 1940s, Rooneys movie characters were no longer in demand and his career went downhill. "In 1938," he said, "I starred in eight pictures. In 1948 and 1949 together, I starred in only three."<ref name=Basinger /> However, film historian Jeanine Basinger notes that although his career "reached the heights and plunged to the depths, Rooney kept on working and growing, the mark of a professional." Some of the films which reinvigorated his popularity, were Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962), Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) and The Black Stallion (film) The Black Stallion (1979). In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in Sugar Babies (musical) Sugar Babies, and "found himself once more back on top."<ref name=Basinger />

Basinger tries to encapsulate Rooneys career:

{{quote Rooneys abundant talent, like his film image, might seem like a metaphor for America: a seemingly endless supply of natural resources that could never dry up, but which, it turned out, could be ruined by excessive use and abuse, by arrogance or power, and which had to be carefully tended to be returned to full capacity. From child star to character actor, from movie shorts to television specials, and from films to Broadway, Rooney ultimately did prove he could do it all, do it well, and keep on doing it. His is a unique career, both for its versatility and its longevity.<ref name=Basinger>Bassinger, Jeanine; Unterburger, Amy L., ed.
