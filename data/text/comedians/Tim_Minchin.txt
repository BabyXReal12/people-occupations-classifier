==Personal life==
Minchin was born in Northampton, England, to Australian parents<ref name=born /> and raised in Perth, Western Australia.<ref name=looney>{{cite web  author=Millar, Anna   url=http://www.list.co.uk/article/10610-tim-minchin-looney-tunes/   title=Tim Minchin – Looney tunes  work=The List  date=31 July 2008   accessdate=20 August 2008}}</ref> His father David Ellison Minchin<ref>Chain Reaction - Series 8 - 4.

Minchin, founding director of Adelaide Zoo.<ref>The Book of Minchin Dorothy Minchin-Comm, Trafford 2006 pp500-503</ref> Minchin is a UK citizen due to being born in England.

He was educated at the private Christ Church Grammar School and started learning piano at the age of eight, but gave it up after three years because he did not enjoy the discipline. He redeveloped an interest in the instrument after he started writing music with his brother Dan Minchin—a guitarist—but still describes himself as a "hack pianist . . . a more you practise, the better you get kind of guy".<ref name="void" /> Minchin graduated from the University of Western Australia (UWA) in 1996 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and theatre, and from the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts in 1998 with a Diploma of Music (Commercial Music).<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5RBG1PadWI  title=Tim Minchin Occasional Address and Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters - YouTube  accessdate=24 February 2014}}</ref> In 2013, he was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Letters from UWA.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.oneperth.com.au/2013/09/17/tim-minchin-doctorate/  title=Tim Minchin scores honorary doctorate  date=17 September 2013  accessdate=24 February 2014}}</ref> In 2015, he was awarded a second Honorary Doctor of Letters, along with Dennis Kelly, from Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts.<ref name="thestage"/>

He currently lives in Sydney<ref>{{cite web   url = http://www.timminchin.com/2017/10/11/california-come-to-my-leaving-la-micro-tour-gigs-next-month-presale-starts-4pm-pdt-today/   title = NEWS AND BLOG   website = TimMinchin.com   accessdate =18 December 2017 }}</ref> with his wife, Sarah.<ref>{{cite news author=Chianta, Rosanna title=A show worth a Minchin – Tim Minchin interview url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/sos-review/A-show-worth-a-Minchin.4350766.jp work=The Scotsman date=3 August 2008 accessdate=8 September 2011}}</ref> They have two children: a daughter, Violet, and a son, Caspar.<ref>{{cite web author=Arthur, Tim title=Tim Minchin: interview url=http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/article/1792/tim-minchin-interview work=Time Out (company) Time Out date=2 December 2010 accessdate=8 September 2011}}</ref> Minchin often refers to his relationships in his songs and stand-up routines.

==Musical comedy==
File:Tim Minchin piano.jpg thumb Minchin playing the piano on stage
Minchin describes his act as a "funny cabaret show" and sees himself primarily as a musician and songwriter as opposed to a comedian; he has said that his songs "just happen to be funny."<ref name="just funny" /> His reasoning for combining the disciplines of music and comedy was revealed in one interview when he said: "Im a good musician for a comedian and Im a good comedian for a musician but if I had to do any of them in isolation I dunno."<ref name="sheffieldinterview">{{cite web  author=Linzy   url=http://angry-feet.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=114473#p114473   title=Interview One – 11th October 2007 at Fagans, Sheffield, UK  work=  date=15 March 2009   accessdate=8 January 2010}}</ref>

He draws on his background in theatre for his distinctive onstage appearance and persona.<ref name="looney" /> In his performances, he typically goes barefoot with wild hair and heavy eye makeup, which is juxtaposed with a crisp suit and tails, and a grand piano. According to Minchin, he likes going barefoot in his shows because it makes him feel more comfortable. He considers the eye makeup important because while he is playing the piano he is not able to use his arms and relies on his face for expressions and gestures; the eyeliner makes his features more distinguishable for the audience.<ref name="void">{{cite web  author=Minchin, Tim   url=http://the-void.co.uk/interview/comedian-tim-minchin/   title=INTERVIEW: Tim Minchin  work=The Void  date=5 June 2007   accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref> He has said that much of his look and persona is about "treading that line between mocking yourself and wanting to be an iconic figure. Mocking the ridiculousness and completely unrealistic dream of being an iconic figure."<ref name="nerd">{{cite web  author=Low, Lenny Ann   url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/rocknroll-nerd/2007/11/07/1194329300055.html   title=Rocknroll nerd  work=The Age  date=8 November 2007   accessdate=20 August 2008}}</ref>

The shows consist largely of Minchins comedic songs and poetry, with subjects including social satire, inflatable dolls, sex fetishes, and his own failed rock star ambitions. In between songs, he performs short stand-up routines.<ref name="just funny" /> Several of his songs deal with religion, a subject with which Minchin—an atheist and a fan of Richard Dawkins—says he is "a bit obsessed".<ref name="time out">{{cite web  author=Arthur, Tim   url=http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/features/5586/Tim_Minchin-interview.html   title=Tim Minchin: interview  work=Time Out London  date=1 September 2008   accessdate=13 September 2008}}</ref> He argues that, as one of the most powerful and influential forces in the world, religion should never be off-limits to satirists. He says that his favourite song to perform is "Peace Anthem for Palestine", which reflects his feelings about religious conflict.<ref name="groggy">{{cite web author=Taylor, Darlene  url=http://www.thegroggysquirrel.com/articles/2007/02/12/tim-minchin2/  title=Interview: Tim Minchin interview  work=The Groggy Squirrel  date=12 February 2007  accessdate=13 September 2008  deadurl=unfit  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506182359/http://www.thegroggysquirrel.com/articles/2007/02/12/tim-minchin2/  archivedate=6 May 2012 }}</ref> In October 2010, he was made a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association. His comedy also deals with taboos more broadly.<ref>{{cite web  author=Minchin, Tim   url=http://www.angry-feet.com/fans/interview/11.php   title=Interview  work=Angry (Feet)  date=December 2007   accessdate=13 September 2008  archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625042656/http://www.angry-feet.com/fans/interview/11.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->  archivedate = 25 June 2008}}</ref> A prime example of this is the song "Prejudice", which parodies the power awarded to something as simple as a word.

===Early career (1998–2007)===
After graduating from WAAPA in 1998, Minchin started out composing music for documentaries and theatre. In 2000, he wrote and starred in the musical Pop at the Blue Room Theatre in Perth.<ref>[http://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/ArchivedStatements/Pages/CourtCoalitionGovernmentSearch.aspx?ItemId=111490&minister=Board&admin=Court&page=2 Major survey of WA youth gets underway: Theatre] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418135936/http://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/ArchivedStatements/Pages/CourtCoalitionGovernmentSearch.aspx?ItemId=111490&minister=Board&admin=Court&page=2  date=18 April 2012 }}</ref> He released a CD titled Sit with his band Timmy the Dog in 2001 but achieved little success.<ref name="stateline" /> In 2002, after only one professional acting job, he moved from Perth to Melbourne to pursue work.<ref name="norwich">{{cite web  author=Saltmarsh, Abigail   url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/content/GoingOut/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=GoingOutComedy&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=GoingOutComedy&itemid=NOED22%20Aug%202008%2011%3A40%3A27%3A820   title=Interview: Tim Minchin  work=Norwich Evening News  date=22 August 2008   accessdate=12 September 2008}}</ref> Minchin struggled initially; he could not get an agent for a year and had been unable to find any acting work.<ref name="stateline" /> While several record companies gave him positive feedback, they were not sure how his music—a mixture of satirical songs and more serious pop songs—could be marketed. He decided to compile all of his humorous songs into a single live show to "get the comedy stuff off my chest" before going back to more serious music.<ref>{{cite web  author=Minchin, Tim   url=http://www.abc.net.au/dig/tv/episodes/20060807_2100.htm   title=7&nbsp;August Episode  work=Dig TV  date=7 August 2006   accessdate=13 September 2008}}</ref>

Minchin says he entered into comedy "naively", having never even attended a live comedy gig before performing one himself.<ref name="time out" /> His break-out show Darkside (co-produced by Laughing Stock Productions) achieved critical success at the 2005 Melbourne International Comedy Festival, where it won the inaugural Festival Directors Award and attracted the notice of Karen Koren, the manager of the well-known Gilded Balloon venues.<ref>{{cite web  author=Woodhead, Cameron   url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts-reviews/tim-minchin/2006/04/19/1145344122118.html   title=Tim Minchin  work=The Age  date=19 April 2006   accessdate=20 August 2008}}</ref> Koren backed the shows run at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where Minchin received the Perrier Comedy Award for Best Newcomer.<ref name="looney" /><ref name="bestnewcomer">{{cite web  author=Reuters/AAP   url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts/minchin-best-newcomer/2005/08/28/1125167538808.html   title=Minchin best newcomer  work=The Age  date=29 August 2005   accessdate=20 August 2008}}</ref> His 2006 show So Rock was nominated for the Melbourne International Comedy Festivals top prize, the Barry Award (for comedy) Barry Award, and in 2007 he was given the award for Best Alternative Comedian at the HBO US Comedy Arts Festival.<ref name="just funny">{{cite web  author=Maxwell, Tom   url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/theguide/Tim39s-just--funny-that.3734007.jp  title=Tims just funny that way  work=Edinburgh Evening News  date=1 February 2008   accessdate=21 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  author=Platt, Craig   url=http://blogs.theage.com.au/lastlaugh/archives/2006/05/last_laugh_barr.html  title=Last Laugh: Barry Award nominees announced  work=The Age – Last Laugh blog  date=1 April 2006   accessdate=21 August 2008}}</ref>

Live recordings of his 2005 and 2006 shows, Darkside (Tim Minchin album) Darkside and So Rock, have been released as CDs. In 2007, he released a DVD titled So Live, featuring a live recording in the Sydney Opera House Studio with material from both of his previous shows.<ref name="nerd" /> As this DVD was only released in Australia, he released a DVD in 2008 entitled So F**king Rock Live in the UK, containing largely the same material as So Live.

===Ready for This? (2008–2010)===
In August 2008, Minchin debuted his third solo show, Ready for This?, at the Edinburgh Fringe and subsequently took it on tour across the UK. During the Edinburgh run, he contributed to The Guardian newspapers podcasts,<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/audio/2008/aug/14/comedy.podcast.10 title=Edinburgh festival podcast: The Guardian Live at the Gilded Balloon, with Tim Minchin author=Miles Jupp authorlink=Miles Jupp work=the Guardian}}</ref> despite his new show containing a song about a Guardian critic who once gave his show a negative review.<ref>{{cite news  title= Edinburgh festival: Tim Minchin author= Brian Logan  newspaper= The Guardian  date= 14 August 2008  url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/13/edinburghfestival.timminchin  accessdate=3 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news  title= Tim Minchin, Gilded Balloon author= Phil Daoust  newspaper= The Guardian date= 16 August 2005 url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/aug/16/comedy accessdate=3 November 2010}}</ref> Responding to the song, which contains graphic violence, the critic laconically remarked that he had not yet had time to listen to it: "Lifes too short and Ive already done my bit by sitting through that show in Edinburgh."<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/sep/28/tim-minchin-interview-matilda-jesus  title=Tim Minchin: I really dont like upsetting people  last=Kellaway  first=Kate  authorlink=Kate Kellaway date=29 September 2013  website=  publisher=The Guardian  access-date=4 October 2015  quote=}}</ref>

It was announced at the end of 2009 that one of Minchins beat poems, "Storm", was to be made into a short animated movie. A blog was launched to accompany the film-making process, and a short trailer was released on 8 January 2010.<ref name=Storm-YT>{{cite web  url=http://www.timminchin.com/2011/04/08/storm/  title=Storm!!!!!!!!   work=TimMinchin.com, News and Blog   date=2011-04-08   accessdate=2017-02-12   last=Minchin   first=Tim http://www.timminchin.com/2011/04/08/storm/}}</ref><ref name="stormtrailer">{{cite web  author=Tracy King   url=http://www.stormmovie.net/blog/2010/01/tim-minchins-storm-official-trailer/#content   title=Tim Minchins Storm – Official Trailer  work=Storm Production Blog  date=8 January 2010   accessdate=11 January 2010   archivedate=2012-03-02   archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302112408/http://www.stormmovie.net/blog/2010/01/tim-minchins-storm-official-trailer/}}</ref> The full movie was launched on YouTube on 7 April 2011.<ref name="stormmovie">{{cite web  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U   title= Tim Minchins Storm the Animated Movie  website=YouTube  date=7 April 2011   accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>

===Tim Minchin and the Heritage Orchestra (2010–2011)===
Minchin embarked on a new arena tour starting with Birmingham on Wednesday 8 December 2010. A departure from the structure of his previous live shows, his act was scaled up to be performed with the Heritage Orchestra. It contained a mixture of material, including new songs on the subject of prayer and of rationality (themes which often appear in his previous work). Minchin stated that the aim of incorporating the orchestra into his act was to create a comedy show that would not be ruined by being performed in arenas, as stated in the special features of the DVD and Blu-ray. The show toured the UK and Australia, and was filmed at the Royal Albert Hall in London for a Blu-ray and DVD that was released in November 2011.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.timminchin.com/2011/10/28/a-big-juicy-tim-minchin-and-the-heritage-orchestra-dvd-announcement/ title=Tim Minchin · A Big, Juicy Tim Minchin and The Heritage Orchestra DVD Announcement! work=Tim Minchin}}</ref>

==Atheism and skepticism==
During his 2009 interview for Australian Skeptics podcast The Skeptic Zone, Minchin addressed his performance style as one that allows bringing up issues that can be upsetting or judgemental to others, such as the "moral hypocrisy about the idea that the Bible is perfect, the only place that you need to go to for your moral guidance...and about, obviously, prejudice in the church, its role in ostracising homosexuals...your defences are down when youre laughing as well and its couched in music. All Im doing is making things consumable that are otherwise difficult to consume."<ref name="SkepticZone26">{{cite podcast  title=The Skeptic Zone #26  date=2009-04-17  website=skepticzone.tv  url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the_skeptic_zone_26_17_april_2009  accessdate=2014-06-06  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220144036/http://ec.libsyn.com/p/9/6/9/969ee23bc7d9ba91/the_skeptic_zone_26_090417.mp3?d13a76d516d9dec20c3d276ce028ed5089ab1ce3dae902ea1d06cd8731d3c05c4a83&c_id=1882109  archive-date=2015-12-20  dead-url=no}}</ref>

As the son and grandson of medical surgeons, Minchin addressed "alternative medicine" claims by relating that unbiased tests for efficacy are the key:
<blockquote>
Youre in such a strong position when you understand the scientific process because all you say is, "Do you understand that the great breakthrough of humanity was figuring out how to make decisions about things whilst discarding human foibles? So, anecdotal evidence involves all your subjectivity—if we do it like this we dont have that anymore. Why, surely do you understand how powerful that is?" And if they dont, then thats what you have to explain to them. Its an extremely powerful thing and a very basic thing.<ref name="SkepticZone26" /></blockquote>

Minchin further explained his Skepticism skeptical outlook:
<blockquote>
Ive always been an atheist; Ive always been an empiricist really. Ive never believed in ghosts or psychics or anything like that cause its quite simple—you dont have to know much to go, "Really?" Or, to just apply Occams Razor, to go, "Is it more likely that souls do circus tricks, or more likely that theyre talking to dead people? And if the latter, by what process? What do you mean talking to dead people? Arent their voice boxes rotten? So without a voice box, how do they talk, and by what means?" It doesnt take much to be skeptical about that. But really understanding, as Im still learning, why science is powerful, is a new step towards being boring at dinner parties.<ref name="SkepticZone26" /></blockquote>

When asked if he thought the universe is full of life, Minchin summarised: "The chances of this happening might be one in infinity. Put it this way: the chance that there being intelligent alien life are, for me, infinitely higher than the chance there being a creator god."<ref name="SkepticZone26" />

In an interview with Independent Investigations Group member John Rael, Minchin explains that what upsets him most about paranormal beliefs is "special pleading" by people who say vague things such as "there is no harm in it". Minchin states that there is very little harm in something like reiki, but asks "where do you draw the line?" when it comes to needing real evidence if a therapy works or not. He states that he is an atheist as well as a skeptic, and cannot understand how someone can be a skeptic and still be religious. "If you apply doubt to anything...the whole religion thing is obviously a fantasy."<ref>{{cite interview  interviewer=John Rael  subject=Tim Minchin  title=Be Skeptical, episode #1  date=10 July 2011  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YGbsQkeMsA  accessdate=10 July 2011 }}</ref>

In 2012, Minchin appeared in a video hosted on the homepage of the British Humanist Association, describing Humanism as important "because having a non-superstitious worldview allows you to go about your own business, making ethical decisions based on a general desire to do the most possible good."<ref name="humanistvideo">{{cite web  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=49&v=DZN8Ne1nmr4  title=Humanism Intro Part 1  last=  first=  date=30 July 2012  publisher=British Humanist Association  access-date=12 November 2016  quote=}}</ref>

===Alternative medicine: Minchins Law===
Minchin has set to verse a Alternative_medicine#Criticism.2C_legitimacy_and_effects scientific-skeptical definition of alternative medicine:
