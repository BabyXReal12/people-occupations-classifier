In his obituary, The Hartford Courant wrote:
<blockquote>Pete Daily was a genial warmhearted man who made friends where ever he went. He was an actor of much originality and really made his own parts as he paid little attention to the lines of the playwright. Introducing his own, and his “gagging” of his parts was as amusing to his stage associates as those in the audience. He was natural comedian as full of life and fun off the stage as on.<ref>"Death of Pete Dailey" - The Hartford Courant, May 25, 1908 p. ?</ref></blockquote>
