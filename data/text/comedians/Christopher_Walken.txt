Prominent movie critic Roger Ebert was particularly impressed by his villain and anti-hero portrayals, once stated "when he is given the right role, there is nobody to touch him for his chilling ability to move between easy charm and pure evil"<ref>[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/at-close-range-1986 Ebert, Roger], Chicago Sun-Times, "At Close Range" film review, 18 April 1986.</ref> and called him "one of the few undeniably charismatic male villains."<ref>[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/king-of-new-york-1990 Ebert, Roger], Chicago Sun-Times, King of New York film review, 7 December 1990.</ref>

Walken, along with a number of " serious actors and respected figures" such as Robert De Niro, began to play roles in comedy films, which marked an innovation.<ref>{{cite book url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5eIBwAAQBAJ&pg=PR21 title=Make em Laugh!

Walkens unique voice has been compared to other entertainment figures with voices that create "a pleasing (or at least entertaining) aural experience," such as William Shatner and Garrison Keillor.<ref>{{cite book url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EeK5UPe5i-UC&pg=PA243  title=The Poetry Gymnasium: 94 Proven Exercises to Shape Your Best Verse author=Tom C.

Walken inspired the stage show, All About Walken: The Impersonators of Christopher Walken, created by actor/comedian Patrick OSullivan in Hollywood in 2006. Walken is noted for refusing movie roles only rarely, having stated in interviews that he will decline a role only if he is simply too busy on other projects to take it. He regards each role as a learning experience.<ref>{{cite web title=Fashion: Celebs And Their Style- Christopher Walken date=7 June 2010 url=http://www.elsaelsa.com/astrology/fashion-style-christopher-walken/ accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref> A rare example of a role Walken turned down was that of Ray Ruby in the film Go Go Tales (2007). According to film director Abel Ferrara, the character was originally written for Walken but the latter "didnt want to do it". The role was then given to Walkens New Rose Hotel (film) New Rose Hotel (1998) co-star Willem Dafoe.<ref>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FskaT9FcNsI Cryptekeeper 044 Abel Ferrara/New Rose Hotel] at YouTube</ref>

===Appearances on Saturday Night Live===
{{blpunsourcedsect date=September 2015}}
Walken has hosted the comedy sketch and satire TV series Saturday Night Live seven times. He is one of only two actors (the other being Alec Baldwin) to have a standing offer from Lorne Michaels to host the show whenever his schedule permits. Walkens SNL appearances have proved so popular that he is one of the few SNL hosts for whom a Best of... SNL DVD is available (other celebrity hosts who have a Best of... SNL DVD are Tom Hanks, Steve Martin, and Alec Baldwin), an honor usually reserved only for SNL cast members.

One of Walkens more famous SNL performances was a spoof of Behind the Music, featuring a recording session of Blue Öyster Cults "(Dont Fear) the Reaper". In the guise of record producer Bruce Dickinson (not to be confused with the real Bruce Dickinson, lead singer for Iron Maiden), Walken makes passionate and slightly unhinged speeches to the band and is obsessed with getting "More Cowbell more cowbell" into the song. The phrase "I gotta have more cowbell" has since been adapted to merchandise. The producer who actually did suggest the cowbell on the original BÖC recording is producer/composer David Lucas (composer) David Lucas.

Walken is also known for his part in one of Will Ferrell and Rachel Dratchs "The Luvahs" skits.<ref>[https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/luvahs/n11683 "The Luvahs" sketch on SNL] (2/23/03) at nbc.com</ref> His character brought a lady friend to meet The Luvahs, and she is subjected to learning the past history that Walkens character shares with The Luvahs. He also divulges private information about his sex life with his girlfriend, much to her horror ("She was willing to accept her lovers body in places no one had ever trespassed...specifically, the ear canal").

Walken spoofed his starring role from The Dead Zone (film) The Dead Zone (1983) in a sketch titled "Ed Glosser: Trivial Psychic" (1992).<ref>[https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/ed-glosser-trivial-psychic/n10314 SNL sketch "Ed Glosser: Trivial Psychic] (10/24/92) at nbc.com</ref> In the film Walkens character can predict deaths and catastrophes, while Glosser can accurately predict meaningless, trivial future but with the same emotional intensity as in the film: "Youre going to get an ice cream headache. Its going to hurt real bad, right here, [touches forehead] for eight, nine seconds.").

His character in A View to a Kill was parodied in a sketch titled "Lease with an Option to Kill", in which he reprised his role as Max Zorin. Zorin, who had taken on some qualities of other notable Bond villains (Blofelds cat and suit, Emilio Largos eye patch), was upset that everything was going wrong for him. His lair was still under construction; his henchmen had jump suits that didnt fit; and his shark tank lacked sharks, having a giant sea sponge instead. A captive James Bond, portrayed by Phil Hartman, offered to get Zorin "a good deal" on the abandoned Blofeld volcanic lair if Zorin let him go, to which he reluctantly agreed.

He performed a song and dance rendition of the Irving Berlin standard, "Lets Face the Music and Dance". Finally, there was the "Colonel Angus" sketch,<ref>[https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/colonel-angus-comes-home/2750240 SNL sketch "Colonel Angus Comes Home"] (2/22/03) at nbc.com</ref> laden with ribald double entendres, in which Walken played a dishonored Confederate States of America Confederate officer.

Until 2003, Walken had a recurring SNL sketch called "The Continental (Saturday Night Live) The Continental",<ref>[http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/christopher-walken-57396/character/the-continental-16691 Christopher Walken in three "Continental" sketches] on SNL at nbc.com</ref> in which Walken played a "suave ladies man" who in reality cannot do anything to keep a woman (a neighbor in his apartment building) from giving him the cold shoulder. Though he is outwardly chivalrous, his more perverted tendencies inevitably drive away his date over his pleading objections. For instance, he invites the woman to wash up in his bathroom; once she is inside, it becomes obvious that the bathroom mirror is a two-way mirror when he is seen lighting up a cigarette. In "The Continental", only the hand of his neighbor is ever seen; the camera always shows her point of view.

The April 5, 2008 Saturday Night Live show was the first time an episode hosted by Walken did not have a "Continental" sketch or a monologue in which he sang and danced. This episode, however, did include one sketch titled "Walken Family Reunion",<ref>[https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/meet-the-family/n12231 SNL sketch "Walken Family Reunion"] (4/5/08) at nbc.com</ref> which spoofs many of Walkens idiosyncrasies. The sketch depicts a fictional Walken family reunion, where all of Christophers relatives have his mannerisms and speech patterns, and sport his trademark pompadour hairstyle. In order of appearance, the other Walkens are Christophers cousin Stanley (Bill Hader); Stanleys brother John (Jason Sudeikis); Johns son Scott (Andy Samberg) and daughter Maxine (Amy Poehler) (who carries a doll that also has a pompadour); Nathan (Fred Armisen), a gay relative for whom "effeminacy flamboyance" means dressing all in black and running his finger around the rim of a cosmopolitan (cocktail) cosmo glass; Uncle Richard (Darrell Hammond) and Aunt Martha (Kristen Wiig), who think that The Deer Hunter was hilarious, and who are hosts of a Nigerian foreign exchange student named Oleki (Kenan Thompson). When he came to live with them, Oleki—who has absorbed all of the Walken Family traits—could not speak any English. But now (he says) he "talks like a normal teenaged American boy". The biggest laugh of the sketch occurs when Christopher expresses his sympathies for Scotts teenaged attitude: "I appreciate your situation. For a Walken, adolescence is a difficult time. You feel like youre the only normal person in a school full of nutjobs." Scotts response: "Wow! Its like youre lookin right into my noggin!" (Will Forte also appears as a waiter at the beginning of the sketch, but does not do a Walken impression.)

===Presidential candidacy hoax===
Walken became the subject of a hoax controversy in 2006, when a fake website started in August of that year by members of Internet forum Genmay.com announced that he was running for President of the United States. Some believed it was authentic, until Walkens publicist dismissed the claims.<ref name="pres">{{cite web  url=http://news.cnet.com/2061-11199_3-5833740.html  title=Christopher Walken for president!  date=August 15, 2006  accessdate=November 16, 2006}}</ref> When asked about the hoax in a September 2006 interview with Conan OBrien, Walken said he was amused; and when asked to come up with a campaign slogan, he replied, "What the Heck" and "No More Zoos!"<ref name="pres" />

==Personal life==
Walken married Georgianne Walken (married and maiden names née Thon), a casting director, in 1969. She is most notable for The Sopranos. The couple have no children. Walken has stated in interviews that having no children is one of the reasons he has had such a prolific film career.<ref name="sacticket2004">{{cite news  title=Bend it like Walken: Actor has more to say about food and hair than acting. url=http://www.sacticket.com/static/movies/news/1024walken.html archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102023834/http://www.sacticket.com/static/movies/news/1024walken.html archivedate=January 2, 2008 first=Dixie  last=Reid  work=The Sacramento Bee  date=October 24, 2004 accessdate=October 25, 2008}}</ref> The Walkens have a cat named Bowtie and their previous cat was named Flapjack.<ref>[http://the-talks.com/interviews/christopher-walken/ "Thats it, its over"], The Talks.
