==Career==
===Early work (1962–1981)===
Music became a writer and a regular performer on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour during 1968 and 1969. His work as a writer on The Mary Tyler Moore Show in 1970 would lead him to his big break.

He was the co-creator of The Bob Newhart Show (with his then-producer/writing partner David Davis (TV producer) David Davis) which went on the air in 1972 and ran for six years; he also co-wrote the theme song to the show with his wife Henrietta.  Music continued writing for the Mary Tyler Moore Show spin-off Rhoda. While casting Rhoda, the producers were looking for a voice actor to play the part of a character that would be heard but never seen: Carlton the doorman. When they heard Musics sleepy, husky voice, they offered him that role, which made his voice recognizable to a worldwide television audience. The character was popular enough to warrant a one-off single in 1975 called "Who Is It?" (b/w "The Girl in 510", United Artists Records United Artists UA-XW643-X), which became a regional hit. Music also co-produced and co-wrote a 1980 animated special Carlton Your Doorman which won an Emmy Award.

In 1976, he and Henrietta were given the opportunity to host a syndicated television variety show of their own. The Lorenzo and Henrietta Music Show was produced at a time when there was a glut of television variety shows, and it did not last.

In 1983, Music voiced the character Ralph the All-Purpose Animal in the stop-motion animated film Twice Upon a Time (1983 film) Twice Upon A Time.

===Garfield (1982–1994)===
{{Main Garfield}}
In 1982, Jim Davis (cartoonist) Jim Daviss Garfield was the most popular comic strip in United States America. Compilation books and merchandising of the strip were topping best seller lists, and Davis was negotiating to make an animated television special. Producers needed someone to voice the main character in the strip: Garfield, a fat, lazy, oafish and demanding cat. The audition attracted several famed vocal talents, including Sterling Holloway, the voice of Winnie the Pooh. After one audition, Music was immediately cast as the voice of Garfield; in Daviss words, "I looked at the room full of [voice] actors, and then in the corner I saw Lorenzo, quietly licking himself". Music would serve as the voice of Garfield in more than 12 television specials and in the Garfield and Friends animated television series that ran from 1988-1994. 

===Other voice work===
Music voiced characters for shows such as TaleSpin as Sgt. Dunder, The Real Ghostbusters, Disneys Adventures of the Gummi Bears as Tummi Gummi, Fluppy Dogs as Ozzie the Green Cool Fluppy, Pac-Man (TV series) Pac-Man, Pound Puppies as Teensy in the season 2 episode Little Big Dog, and Darkwing Duck. In the mid-1990s, after Garfield and Friends, Darkwing Duck and Disneys Adventures of the Gummi Bears concluded, Music retired from cartoon voice acting.

During the 1980s, Music also did voice-overs for many commercials for prime-time TV, such as Larry the Crash Test Dummy in the "You Could Learn a Lot from a Dummy" public safety announcements sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation and for Florida grapefruit juice, a lesser known series of commercials extolling Florida agriculture as opposed to the more popular "Florida orange juice" commercials.

In keeping with his beliefs in Subud and emphasis on charity, Music frequently volunteered his time on a suicide hotline. Music recalled that sometimes a caller would change his tone: "I am bankrupt, my wife ran off with another man...Hey, you sound just like that cat on TV!"<ref name="evanier">{{cite web  last1=Evanier  first1=Mark  title=Lorenzo Music, R.I.P.  url=http://www.newsfromme.com/2001/08/05/lorenzo-music-r-i-p/  website=News From Me  author-link=Mark Evanier  date=August 5, 2001  accessdate=March 30, 2016}}</ref>

===Later years (1995–2001)===
In 1996, Musics voice could be heard on Stan Frebergs Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America Volume Two album, released as a CD by Rhino Entertainment Rhino Records. Music appears on the album as James Madison and Robert E. Lee. Music also appeared as an intercom announcer on an episode of The Drew Carey Show.

In the early 1990s, he served as the voice-over for commercials for Ore Ida Potatoes and Fruit and Cream Strawberry Twinkies. He later served as the pitchman for Ruggles Ice Cream (a local brand from Orrville, Ohio).

Music continued his role of Garfield for commercials and several PC games, such as Garfields Mad About Cats, through the 1990s and early 2000s.

His last appearance as the voice of Garfield was for an automobile commercial in 2001.

==Personal life and death==
Music was married to composer/writer Henrietta Music; together they have four children.<ref name=NYT/><ref>{{cite news  title=Lorenzo Music; Voice of Garfield the Cat  url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/08/local/me-31716  date=August 8, 2001  first=Myrna  last=Oliver  work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

Music died from complications related to lung cancer lung and Osteosarcoma bone cancer on August 4, 2001. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea. He was survived by his wife Henrietta and their four children.<ref name=NYT/>

==Legacy==
Since Musics death, Frank Welker has often replaced him as the voice of Garfield in recent productions of the Garfield franchise including three fully-CGI films: Garfield Gets Real, Garfields Fun Fest, and Garfields Pet Force and the CGI animated series, The Garfield Show. Also, Bill Murray was chosen to voice Garfield in the live-action/animated films Garfield: The Movie and Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties. Music voiced Murrays character of Doctor Peter Venkman in The Real Ghostbusters.  Meanwhile, Frank Welker also provided the voice of Ray Stantz on The Real Ghostbusters.
