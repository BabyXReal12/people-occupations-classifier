===Saturday Night Live===
Wheelan was a recurring guest on Saturday Night Live{{}}s "Weekend Update," using his stand-up stories as public service announcements against irresponsible behavior. On the Bruce Willis / Katy Perry episode, the commentary centered on having tattoos that have no meaning, with Wheelan showing off three tattoos he had in his youth: A tribal stamp on his left arm meant to look like the one Anthony Kiedis from Red Hot Chili Peppers has, a nautical star on his right arm, and a weird oceanscape on his side (which came from a doodle he drew in his freshman year of high school, and which does not make sense to him because he grew up in Iowa, which is not a coastal state). On the Anna Kendrick / Pharrell Williams episode, the commentary centered on the dangers of drinking alcohol, and the story of how his friends put butter down his pants while he was Blackout (drug-related amnesia) blacked out drunk and Wheelan worrying that he was dying of an undiscovered Sexually transmitted infection sexually transmitted disease.{{citation needed date=December 2016}}

On July 14, 2014, Wheelan announced through Twitter that he was no longer a cast member of Saturday Night Live, stating, "FIRED FROM NEW YORK ITS SATURDAY NIGHT!".<ref>{{cite web last1=Barsanti first1=Sam title=Saturday Night Live has fired Brooks Wheelan url=http://www.avclub.com/article/brooks-wheelan-fired-saturday-night-live-206907 website=A.V.
