The Comedy Central special was filmed in New York City. He made an appearance on The Jim Gaffigan Show.{{cn date=August 2018}}

==Comedy style==
Davidson has been lauded for basing his comedy on his own life and employing aspects of his life that have been likened to "a series of brutal truths and vulgar confessions," and which make him relatable to audiences. Touching upon topics such as marijuana, sex, and relationships, incidents he relates include those from his awkward high school experiences to living in a dormitory during his brief stint at St. Francis College.<ref name=Diamondback/> Davidson jokes about highly sensitive subjects, including the loss of his father during the September 11 attacks, because, he says, he finds that it empowers him to address the feeling of powerlessness that experiencing such tragedy at a young age inflicted upon him.<ref name=NYTimes/> He is a fan of the Harry Potter franchise, and has incorporated that material into his comedy work as well.<ref name=Diamondback/><ref name=EW9.29.14/>

==Personal life==
As of October 2015, Davidson lives in Brooklyn Heights Brooklyn Heights, New York.<ref name=NYTimes/>

Davidson has his fathers badge number, 8418, tattooed on his left arm.<ref name=NYTimes/> Davidson supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and on December 5, 2017, he stated on his Instagram account that he got a tattoo on his leg of Clinton, whom he called his "hero", a "badass", and "one of the strongest people in the universe." Clinton herself thanked Davidson for the compliment, commenting, "This makes it significantly less awkward that I’ve had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years."<ref>Hearon, Sarah (December 15, 2017).
