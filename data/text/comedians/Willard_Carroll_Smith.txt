Smith started as the MC#Hip hop MC of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince, with his childhood friend DJ Jazzy Jeff Jeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townes as turntablist and producer.
Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smiths residence, and he was missing his hype man. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man finally made it to the party.
Soon after, the two decided to join forces. Smith enlisted a friend to join as the beatboxer of the group, Clarence Holmes (Ready Rock C), making them a trio. Philadelphia-based Word Up Records released their first single in late 1985 to 1986 when A&amp;R man Paul Oakenfold
introduced them to Word Up with their single "Girls Aint Nothing but Trouble," a tale of funny misadventures that landed Smith and his former DJ and rap partner Mark Forrest (Lord Supreme) in trouble.
The song sample (music) sampled the theme song of "I Dream of Jeannie." Smith became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable, though profanity-free, "battle" rhymes. The single became a hit a month before Smith graduated from high school.
Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention of Jive Records and Russell Simmons. The duos first album, Rock the House (album) Rock the House, which was first released on Word Up in 1986 debuted on Jive in  March of 1987 in music 1987. The group received the first Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance in 1989 for "Parents Just Dont Understand" (1988), though their most successful single was "Summertime (DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince song) Summertime" (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 Billboard Hot 100. Smith and Townes are still friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs under Smiths solo performer credit.
Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes.
