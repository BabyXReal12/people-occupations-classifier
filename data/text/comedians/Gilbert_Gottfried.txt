Gilbert Jeremy Gottfried
(born February 28, 1955) is an American stand-up comedian, actor and voice actor. Gottfrieds persona as a comedian features an exaggerated shrill voice and emphasis on crude humor. His numerous roles in film and television include voicing the parrot Iago (Disney character) Iago in Disneys Aladdin (1992 Disney film) Aladdin, Digit in the childrens cartoon/educational math-based show Cyberchase, and Kraang Subprime in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Gottfried was also the voice of the Aflac Duck until 2011.

Since 2014, Gottfried has hosted a podcast, Gilbert Gottfrieds Amazing Colossal Podcast, which features new episodes each week featuring discussions of classic movies and celebrity interviews, most often with veteran actors, comedians, musicians and comedy writers.
Gilbert (documentary) Gilbert, a documentary film on Gottfrieds life and career, was released in 2017.

==Career==

===Early career (1970–1998)===
At age 15, Gottfried began doing amateur stand-up in New York City and, after a few years, became known around New York as "the comedians comedian."
In 1980, Saturday Night Live was being retooled with a new staff and new comedians; the producers noticed Gottfried and hired him as a cast member for Saturday Night Live (season 6) season 6.
Gottfrieds persona in SNL sketches was very different from his later characterization: he rarely (if ever) spoke in his trademark screeching, obnoxious voice and never squinted. During his 12-episode stint, he was given very little airtime and seldom used in sketches. Gottfried recalls a low point was having to play a corpse in a sketch about a sports organist hired to play inappropriate music at a funeral. Despite this, he had one recurring character (Leo Waxman, husband to Denny Dillons Pinky Waxman on the recurring talk show sketch, "Whats It All About?") and two celebrity impersonations: David A. Stockman and controversial film director Roman Polanski.

Gottfried also played accountant Sidney Bernstein in the 1987 film Beverly Hills Cop II.

Although not a regular, he also appeared in The Amazing Live Sea Monkeys, as well as voicing the crazed dentist Dr. Bender and his son Wendell in The Fairly OddParents and the voice of Jerry the Belly Button Elf on Ren and Stimpy. Three of his most prominent roles came in 1990, 1991, and 1992, when he was cast as the adoption agent Problem Child (film)#Cast Igor Peabody in Problem Child (film) Problem Child and Problem Child 2 and the parrot Iago (Aladdin)#Iago Iago in Aladdin (1992 Disney film) Aladdin. When asked how he prepared for the role, Gottfried said, "I did the whole Robert De Niro DeNiro thing. I moved to South America! I lived in the trees!" Gottfried reprised the role in Aladdin: The Return of Jafar, Aladdin and the King of Thieves, the Aladdin (TV series) television series and various related media, such as Kingdom Hearts and Disneys House of Mouse House of Mouse. Gottfried also voiced Berkely Beetle in 1994s Thumbelina.

In 1996, he starred as a talking smoke detector, in "Be Cool about Fire Safety," a short fire safety video for younger audiences.

Gottfried was the host of the Saturday edition of USA Up All Night for its entire run from 1989 to 1998.

===Voice acting, television and films (1999–present)===
On the most recent version of Hollywood Squares, Gottfried was a regular guest. On one particular episode, which aired on October 1, 1999, he was the last square on the board for a five-square win, but both contestants repeatedly got his answers wrong, prompting Gottfried to yell "YOU FOOL!" with every incorrect response. It took seven tries before a contestant finally correctly agreed with him, specifically on a question of "smog" being a combination of smoke and fog.

Gottfried has provided the voice of the duck in the Aflac commercials and Digit (Cyberchase) Digit in Cyberchase, as well as Mister Mxyzptlk in Superman: The Animated Series. He also voiced a nasty wisecracking criminal genius named Nick-Nack in two episodes of Superboy (TV series) Superboy (he also co-wrote an issue of Superboy: The Comic Book, which featured Nick-Nacks origin). On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Gottfried has made regular appearances.

Gottfried was part of an online advertising campaign for Microsofts Office XP software, showing, in a series of Flash-animated cartoons, that the Clippy office assistant would be removed. In 2006, Gottfried topped the Boston Phoenix
s tongue-in-cheek list of the worlds 100 Unsexiest Men. In April 2006, Gottfried performed with the University of Pennsylvanias Mask and Wig Club in their annual Intercollegiate Comedy Festival. Also in 2006, he made an appearance on the Lets Make a Deal portion of Gameshow Marathon (US TV series) Gameshow Marathon (as a baby in a large high chair, he says "Hey Ricki Lake Ricki, I think I need my diaper changed!"), and in the Dodge Viper in the big deal (where he tells the contestants "What were you thinking?!" because neither one picked it). He also guest-starred in The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy as Santa Claus in the one-hour Christmas Special. He voiced Rick Platypus in an episode of My Gym Partners a Monkey entitled List of My Gym Partners a Monkey episodes "That Darn Platypus".

He appeared as Peters horse in an episode of Family Guy entitled "Boys Do Cry" (in which Peter Griffin is enthused to learn that Gottfried is providing the horses voice). He also guest-starred in Hannah Montana as Barny Bittmen. In January 2009, Gottfried worked again with David Faustino for an episode of Faustinos show Star-ving.
In 2011, Gottfried appeared in the episode "Lost Traveler" on Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit as Leo Gerber, a sarcastic computer professional working for the NYPDs Technical Assistance Response Unit, which producer Warren Leight said could become a recurring character.
Gottfried read a section from the hit book Fifty Shades of Grey in a June 2012 YouTube video, which was created with the aim of using Gottfrieds trademark voice to make fun of the books graphic sexual content.
In 2013, Gottfried became a member of "Team Rachael Ray Rachael" on the second season of Food Networks Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off. In March 2013 he appeared on American Broadcasting Company ABCs Wife Swap (U.S. TV series)#Celebrity Wife Swap Celebrity Wife Swap. He swapped wives with Alan Thicke.

On May 28, 2014, Sideshow Network premiered Gilbert Gottfrieds Amazing Colossal Podcast, an interview series where Gottfried and his co-host Frank Santopadre discuss classic movies and talk to "Hollywood legends and behind-the-scenes talents" who shaped Gottfrieds childhood and influenced his comedy.
His first guest was Dick Cavett.

Gottfried was the third contestant fired during The Apprentice (U.S. season 14) the fourteenth season of the NBC reality television reality show The Celebrity Apprentice. In 2016 he played the Pig Man in a comedy/fantasy film Abnormal Attraction.
{{clear left}} In 2017 he appeared as himself in Episodes (TV series) Episodes, where a contestant on a fictional TV endurance gameshow is penalised with "48 hours of Gilbert Gottfried".

On 10 June 2018 he appeared in a special segment of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver where, for UK viewers only, a segment about the UKs law restricting broadcast of debates from the Houses of Parliament was replaced by five minutes of him reading "3 star Yelp reviews", along with host John Oliver telling the audience "you brought this on yourself because of your stupid law".

==Personal life==
In the late 1990s, Gottfried met Dara Kravitz at a Grammy Awards party. They were married in 2007 and have two children together, daughter Lily and son Max.
They reside in the Chelsea, Manhattan Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Gottfried was raised in a American Jews Jewish family, but he has commented on his podcast that he did not have a bar mitzvah.
One of his sisters was Arlene Gottfried, a New York Street photographer, who died in 2017.

==Comedic style==
Danny Gallagher of the Dallas Observer wrote that "Gottfried has one of the most original formulas in the history of comedy", adding: 
{{Cquote You dont just laugh at the punchline when Gilbert Gottfried tells a joke. You laugh at the setup. You laugh at his comments about the joke. You even laugh at the segues between his jokes.
}}
Gottfried is known for speaking in a loud and grating voice, which is not his natural speaking voice.
Mark Binneli of Rolling Stone described Gottfried as a "squinting, squawking mass of contradictions", noting his status as "one of Americas filthiest stand-ups and one of the most successful voice-over artists in childrens entertainment."
Gottfried is known for joking about recent tragedies. In a July 2012 op-ed for CNN, he wrote: 
{{Cquote I have always felt comedy and tragedy are roommates. If you look up comedy and tragedy, you will find a very old Sock and buskin picture of two masks. One mask is tragedy. It looks like its crying. The other mask is comedy. It looks like its laughing. Nowadays, we would say, How tasteless and insensitive. A comedy mask is laughing at a tragedy mask.
}}

==Controversial jokes==

===1991 Emmy Awards===
At the 43rd Primetime Emmy Awards, Gottfried made "an endless series of masturbation jokes" in reference to Paul Reubens arrest for masturbating in an adult movie theater.
Viewers on the east coast saw the entire set live, but Fox censored the broadcast for the west coast delay.
Fox issued an apology, stating that Gottfrieds jokes were "irresponsible and insulting".
Gottfried said that producers stated he would not be invited back,
and Rolling Stone wrote that the monologue resulted in him being "blacklisted".
===September 11 joke===
During his monologue at a New York Friars Club Friars Club Roast (comedy) roast of Hugh Hefner three weeks after the September 11 attacks, Gottfried joked that he had intended to catch a plane, but could not get a direct flight because "they said they have to stop at the Empire State Building first". This was one of the first public examples of 9/11 humor. Audience members responded with hisses and a cry of "Too soon!" Gottfried then abandoned his prepared remarks and launched into the venerable The Aristocrats (joke) Aristocrats joke, winning back the audience.
Penn Jillette and Paul Provenza used Gottfrieds monologue as a segment in their 2005 film The Aristocrats (film) The Aristocrats.
===Japanese tsunami jokes===
In March 2011, Gottfried made a series of jokes on his Twitter account about the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami earthquake disaster in Japan.
Aflac, which does 75% of its business in Japan, responded by dismissing Gottfried from voicing its Aflac#The Aflac Duck duck mascot on March 14, 2011, and announced a casting call for his replacement as the voice of the duck.
He was replaced by Daniel McKeague (who did an impression of Gottfried) on April 26, 2011.
