 quote=Everyones coming up to me half in tears, Arj what about Global Warming – what about Climate Change and the planet? and everybodys convinced that the earth has a problem – because its so hot. But how come I dont hear a single intelligent individual aside from myself suggest the seemingly obvious possibility that the Earth is just fine thank you – but theres something wrong with the sun! Cause Im not a scientist, but Im pretty sure that son of a bitch is where all the heat is coming from. And all Im sayin is, when I burn my toast, I dont blame the bread. [crowd cheering] Wow. You guys really love toast jokes. source=Original Style Bits and Pieces, Dec 8, 2009, Brisbane}}
