==Career==

===Early career===
Carvey had a minor role in Halloween II (1981 film) Halloween II in 1981, and co-starred in One of the Boys (TV series) One of the Boys in 1982, a short-lived television sitcom that also starred Mickey Rooney, Nathan Lane, and Meg Ryan. In 1984, Carvey had a small role in Rob Reiners film This Is Spinal Tap, in which he played a mime artist mime, with fellow comedian Billy Crystal (who tells him "wikt:time is money Mime is money!"). He appeared in the music video for the Greg Kihn song "Lucky" in 1985. He also appeared in the short-lived film-based action television series Blue Thunder (TV series) Blue Thunder. His big break came in 1986, when he co-starred opposite Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster in Tough Guys. As a lifelong Douglas fan, Carvey threw in an affectionate impression of his mentor, while describing a hairy scene they did together on a moving train.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/23/movies/review-television-a-salute-to-kirk-douglas-for-his-life.html title=Review/Television; A Salute to Kirk Douglas for His Life publisher=NyTimes.com date=May 23, 1991  accessdate=January 31, 2017}}</ref>

Carvey was a finalist for the hosting role on the Nickelodeon TV game show Double Dare (Nickelodeon game show) Double Dare. He ultimately withdrew his name from consideration after he was cast on Saturday Night Live. The job would go to Marc Summers.

===Saturday Night Live===
In 1986, Carvey became a household name when he joined the cast of NBCs Saturday Night Live. He, along with newcomers Phil Hartman, Kevin Nealon, Jan Hooks, and Victoria Jackson, helped to reverse the shows declining popularity and made SNL "must-see" TV once again. An important part of the shows revival was Carveys breakout character, the Church Lady, the uptight, smug, and pious host of Church Chat.<ref name="snlbackstage20110220">{{cite episode   title=Saturday Night Live Backstage   network=NBC   series=Saturday Night Live   airdate=2011-02-20}}</ref> Carvey said he based the character on women he knew from church while growing up, who would keep track of other churchgoers attendance. He became so associated with the character that later cast members such as Chris Farley referred to Carvey simply as "The Lady".<ref>

Carveys other original characters included Garth Algar (from Waynes World), who was based on his brother;<ref name=newsday>{{cite web url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/celebrities/dana-carvey-does-stand-up-at-the-paramount-1.5175640 title=Dana Carvey does stand-up at the Paramount work=Newsday}}</ref> Hans (from "Hans and Franz"); and the Grumpy Old Man (from Weekend Update appearances).  Throughout the election and presidency of George H. W. Bush, he was the designated impersonator of the president, making him the lead actor of the regular political sketches on SNL.

During the United States presidential election, 1992 1992 US presidential election campaign, Carvey also did an impression of independent candidate Ross Perot; in a prime-time special before the election, Carvey played both George H. W. Bush and Perot in a three-way debate with Bill Clinton, played by Phil Hartman. As Perot—recorded and timed to give the appearance of interacting with the live Bush and Clinton—Carvey eschewed the shows signature "Live from New York" opening line, telling Bush "Why dont you do it, live-boy?" Carvey left SNL in 1993.

In 1992, Carvey joined Mike Myers in Waynes World, the film. A sequel, Waynes World 2, was filmed and released in 1993.

Carveys SNL work won him an Emmy Award in 1993 for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program. He has a total of six Emmy<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/dana-carvey  title=Dana Carvey Emmy Nominated  publisher=Emmys.com  accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref> nominations. Carvey has returned to host SNL four times, in 1994, 1996, 2000, and 2011.

===After SNL===
NBC executives hoped to get Carvey to take over the 12:30&nbsp;am ET weeknight spot in the networks lineup in 1993 when David Letterman left his show, Late Night with David Letterman, for an 11:30&nbsp;pm ET show on CBS. The 12:30 spot eventually went to Conan OBrien.

In 1994, Carvey starred in the film Clean Slate (1994 film) Clean Slate.  The following year, Carvey filmed his first HBO stand-up special Critics Choice.  The show featured Carvey doing many of his SNL impersonations, as well as making fun of the premium channels name, pronouncing it "hobo".

He had to turn down a role in Bad Boys (1995 film) Bad Boys because he felt overwhelmed as a new father.<ref name=newsday/>

He reprised many of his SNL characters in 1996 for The Dana Carvey Show, a short-lived prime-time variety show on American Broadcasting Company ABC. The show was most notable for launching Robert Smigels cartoon "The Ambiguously Gay Duo", as well as the careers of Steve Carell and Stephen Colbert.

In 2002, he returned to films in the spy comedy The Master of Disguise. Released a week after former colleague Mike Myers successful (and similar) film Austin Powers in Goldmember, most critics compared the movies and panned Carveys effort. However, the movie did manage about $40 million at the North American box office.
In March 2007, review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes ranked the film as the 18th worst-reviewed movie of the 2000s decade, with an approval rating of 1% based on 103 reviews.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/master_of_disguise/  title=Rotten Tomatoes  publisher=Rotten Tomatoes  accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref> Comedian and former Mystery Science Theater 3000 host Michael J.

Carvey eventually withdrew from the limelight to focus on his family. He later said in an interview that he does not want to be in a career in which his kids would already be grown with him having neglected spending time with them, a major reason for his declining the hosting spot for Late Night that ultimately went to Conan OBrien. Carvey has said that he generally prefers stand-up comedy to acting in movies and regularly performs lucrative corporate dates, boasting of "a few million-dollar months" during a 2016 Howard Stern interview.<ref>{{cite web url=http://marksfriggin.com/news16/10-31.htm#wed title=MarksFriggin.com - Stern Show News - Archive author= date= website=marksfriggin.com accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=https://www.gq.com/story/dana-carvey-oral-history-dana-carvey-show title=An Oral History of the Rise and Fall (and Rise) of "The Dana Carvey Show" first=Mike last=Ryan date=8 August 2011 website=gq.com accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref>

Carvey made an appearance at the 2008 MTV Movie Awards, reprising his SNL character Garth Algar with host Mike Myers for a "Waynes World" sketch. On June 14, 2008, Carvey filmed a second HBO stand-up special, the first in 13 years, entitled Squatting Monkeys Tell No Lies.

In 2010, Carvey appeared in the Funny or Die original comedy sketch Presidential Reunion. He played the role of President George H. W. Bush alongside other current and former SNL president impersonators.

In early 2010, Carvey and comedian/writer Spike Feresten created and starred together in Spoof, a sketch comedy pilot for Fox Broadcasting Company Fox. This included a sketch of a trailer for "Darwin", a mock film in which he played the evolutionary biologist, as well as a spoof of the hit TV series Lost (TV series) Lost. Both of these sketches can be seen on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web author=  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Odsuv8x67dk  title=Dana Carvey is "DARWIN"  publisher=YouTube  date=2007-06-16  accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web author=  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQB0NqRNCCo&feature=related  title=Dana Carveys LOST Spin-off  publisher=YouTube  accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref> On the animated TV series The Fairly OddParents, Carvey voiced List of The Fairly OddParents characters Cosmo Cosmas con artist brother Schnozmo.

On April 29 and 30 of 2016 Dana Carvey recorded two live performances at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts for a Netflix special to be released later in the year.  Trying their own hands at stand-up comedy, Danas two sons Tom and Dex opened the show for him.

==Personal life==
In 1979, while performing at The Other Cafe in San Francisco, Carvey met Paula Zwagerman. They became engaged in 1981 and married in 1983. The couple has two children, Dex and Thomas Carvey.<ref>{{cite web title=Dana Carvey Biography url=http://www.biography.com/people/dana-carvey-225198 website=Biography.com publisher=A&E Television Networks accessdate=2 November 2015}}</ref>

In 1997, Carvey underwent Coronary artery bypass surgery heart bypass surgery for a blocked coronary artery, but the surgeon operated on the wrong artery. The blocked artery was deeply buried in muscle and thus hard to find; another artery, though not blocked, was clearly accessible; so the surgeon mistakenly performed the bypass on this unblocked artery. Carvey, later suffering from angina pectoris, sued for medical malpractice and was awarded $8 million in damages. He donated the money to charity.<ref>{{cite news last1=Falcon first1=Mike title=USATODAY.com - Heart operation no laugh for Dana Carvey url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/spotlight/2001-11-05-carvey-heart.htm accessdate=4 December 2016 work=USA Today}}</ref><ref>{{cite news title=Dana Carvey Back After Heart Problems url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=132097&page=1 accessdate=4 December 2016 work=ABC News date=6 January 2006}}</ref> He has had to undergo additional surgery to correct his heart problems.<ref>{{cite web url=http://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-heart-of-the-matter-vol-53-no-22/ title=Cover Story: The Heart of the Matter – Vol. 53 No. 22 author= date=5 June 2000 website=people.com accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref> He told Newsday that, while he was in the hospital for his final angioplasty, Frank Sinatra died in the room adjacent to his.<ref name=newsday/>
