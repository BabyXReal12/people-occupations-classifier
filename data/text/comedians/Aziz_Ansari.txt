Ansari described himself as "Irreligious not religious" on Twitter.
He was raised as a Muslim by his parents.
Ansari was in a relationship with professional chef Courtney McBroom from 2014 to January 2016.
He has self-identified as a feminist, saying his girlfriend has helped influence him. Ansari also incorporated an episode about feminism titled "Ladies and Gentlemen" in Master of None. In an interview in 2015, he spoke about the episodes meaningfulness to him saying "I thought it was interesting that this is happening, yet so many people are unaware of it. And the problem is people arent talking about it. What Ive learned, as a guy, is to just ask women questions and listen to what they have to say. Go to your group of female friends and ask them about times theyve experienced sexism at their job, and youll get blown away by the things they tell you."
Ansari is a "foodie" (although he dislikes the term);
he and his friends Eric Wareheim and Jason Woliner have formed what they called "The Food Club", which involves them dressing up in suits and captain hats and rewarding restaurants with "Food Club" plaques. The plaques have their faces engraved along with the words: "The Food Club has dined here and deemed it plaque-worthy". He explained to Vanity Fair (magazine) Vanity Fair, "Its a really serious-looking plaque and all of the restaurants weve given it to have put it front and center. Its funny because people will walk into a restaurant and be like, What the fuck is the Food Club? Who are these guys etched in gold?"
They also produced a tongue-in-cheek video about the club for Jash, filming them debating whether or not restaurants were plaque-worthy.
Ansari was a close friend of the late comedian Harris Wittels and they frequently worked together.
He has a brother, Aniz Adam Ansari,
who co-wrote an episode of Master of None.
In January 2018, a woman using the pseudonym Grace accused Ansari of sexual misconduct in an article on Babe.net.
The article was met with a polarized and mixed response among commentators and the public with disagreement as to whether the incident described in the Babe article constitutes sexual misconduct.
Ansari stated that the encounter "by all indications was completely consensual,"
but critics have stated that his actions were Misogyny misogynist, lacked Consent#Affirmative affirmative consent, and spoke to a larger culture of Toxic masculinity harmful male expectations.
Others say that Ansaris actions did not constitute sexual misconduct and that his accusers narrative trivializes the Me Too (hashtag) larger movement against forms of sexual abuse.
In an article for The Atlantic, Caitlin Flanagan wrote that the narrative in Babe was revenge porn. HLN host Ashleigh Banfield called Ansaris accusers actions "appalling" and said she damaged the Me_Too_movement #MeToo movement.
