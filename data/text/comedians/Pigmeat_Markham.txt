He was sometimes credited in films as David "Pigmeat" Markham or  Pigmeat "Alamo" Markham.

He was born in the community of Hayti, Durham, North Carolina.<ref name="registry"/> His family was the most prominent on their street, which came to be called (and later officially named) Markham Street in the Hayti District. Markham began his career in traveling music and American burlesque burlesque shows. For a time he was a member of Bessie Smiths Traveling Revue in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web  url = http://www.phillipscollection.org/education/exploring-The%20North.pdf  title= Primary Source 45  accessdate= 2008-01-20  format = PDF  work= Jacob Lawrence and The Migration Series  archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080228052639/http://www.phillipscollection.org/education/exploring-The%20North.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->  archivedate = February 28, 2008}}</ref> Later, he claimed he originated the Truckin dance which became nationally popular at the start of the 1930s. In the 1940s he started making film appearances. In 1964 he recorded "Open the Door, Richard".<ref>{{cite web url={{Allmusic class=artist id=p195/discography pure_url=yes}} title=allmusic ((( Pigmeat Markham > Discography > Main Albums ))) publisher=www.allmusic.com accessdate=2008-03-08}}</ref>

Markham was a familiar act at New Yorks famed Apollo Theater where he wore blackface makeup and huge painted white lips, despite complaints the vaudeville tradition was degrading. He probably played at the Apollo more frequently than any other performer.<ref name=fox>{{cite book  last= Fox  first= Ted  title= Showtime at the Apollo  publisher= Da Capo  year= 1983  isbn= 9780030605338 pages = 94}}</ref>
Starting in the 1950s Pigmeat Markham began appearing on television, making multiple appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show.<ref>{{cite web  url= http://www.thewoodlawncemetery.org/africanamerican.html  title= African American Legacy of The Woodlawn Cemetery  accessdate= 2008-01-20  deadurl= yes  archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080104091819/http://www.thewoodlawncemetery.org/africanamerican.html  archivedate= January 4, 2008  df= mdy-all }}</ref>

His boisterous, indecorous "heyeah (here) come da judge" schtick, which made a mockery of formal courtroom etiquette, became his signature routine. Markham would sit at an elevated judges bench (often in a black graduation cap-and-gown, to look more impressive), and deal with a series of comic miscreants.  He would often deliver his "judgments", as well as express frustration with the accused, by leaning over the bench and smacking the accused with an inflated bladder-balloon. He had hit comedy recordings in the 1960s on Chess Records, and saw his routines entry line become a catchphrase on the Rowan & Martins Laugh-In NBC television show, as did his phrase "Look that up in your Funk and Wagnalls".

Markhams most famous routine was "discovered" by the general public only after Sammy Davis, Jr. had performed it as a guest on the March 25, 1968 episode of Laugh-In. Due to the years of racial segregation in the entertainment world, he was not widely known by white audiences, and had almost exclusively performed on the "chitlin circuit" of vaudeville, theatres, and night clubs<ref name="allmusic"/> and appeared in several Race movie race films, including William D. Alexanders 1949 revue film Burlesque in Harlem, which documented the chitlin circuit.

The phenomenal ripple effect of Daviss version of "the judge" led to Markhams opportunity to perform his signature Judge character himself as a Laugh-In regular during the 1968–69 television season.<ref>{{cite web  url= http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF0302/Watkins/Watkins.html  title= Black Humor: On The Real Side  accessdate= 2008-01-20  last= Watkins  first= Mel  year= 1979  work= APF Reporter Vol. 3 #2  deadurl= yes  archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080119215936/http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF0302/Watkins/Watkins.html  archivedate= January 19, 2008  df= mdy-all }}</ref> Archie Campbell later adapted Markhams routine, performing as "Justus OPeace," on the American country music country version of Laugh-In, Hee Haw, which borrowed heavily from the minstrel show tradition.

Thanks to his Heyeah come da judge routine, which originally was accompanied by music with a funky beat, Pigmeat Markham is regarded as a forerunner of rapping rap.<ref name=rap>{{cite news last=Jones first=Alistair title=Reasons rhyme for a history under raps url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/books/reasons-rhyme-for-a-history-under-raps/story-e6frg8nf-1226011610605 accessdate=November 3, 2012 newspaper=www.theaustralian.com.au date=February 26, 2011}}</ref> His song "Here Comes the Judge (Pigmeat Markham song) Here Comes the Judge" peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 Billboard<ref name=md>(click on "Read More" once at the site) {{ cite web  url={{BillboardURLbyName artist=pigmeat markham chart=all}}  author=Mark Deming  title=Pigmeat Markham at Billboard.com  publisher=All Music Guide  accessdate=December 2, 2012}}</ref> and other charts in 1968. He published an autobiography, Here Come the Judge!, in the wake of his Laugh-In success.
