==Early life and education==
Cox was born on December 6, 1924, in Detroit Detroit, Michigan.<ref name=obit/> When he was 10, he moved with his divorced mother, mystery author Eleanor Blake, and a younger sister to Evanston, Illinois, where he became close friends with another child in the  neighborhood, Marlon Brando.<ref name="When the wild one met the mild one"/> His family moved frequently, eventually to Chicago, then New York City, then back to Detroit, where he graduated from Denby High School.

During World War II, Cox and his family returned to New York City, where he attended City College of New York.<ref name=obit/> He next spent four months in the United States Army, and on his discharge attended New York University.<ref>[http://www.anb.org/articles/18/18-03772.html Ann T. Keene. "Cox, Wally"; American National Biography Online Feb. 2000.]</ref> He supported his invalid mother and sister by making and selling jewelry in a small shop and at parties, where he started doing comedy monologues. These would lead to regular performances at nightclubs, such as the Village Vanguard, beginning in December 1948. He became the roommate of Marlon Brando, who encouraged him to study acting with Stella Adler. Cox and Brando remained close friends for the rest of Coxs life, and Brando appeared unannounced at Coxs wake. Brando is also reported to have kept Coxs ashes in his bedroom and conversed with them nightly.<ref name="When the wild one met the mild one">{{cite journal  author=Robert W.

==Career==

In 1949, Cox appeared on the CBS network-radio show Arthur Godfreys Talent Scouts, to the great amusement of host Godfrey. The first half of his act was a monologue in a slangy, almost-mumbled punk-kid characterization, telling listeners about his friend Dufo: "What a crazy guy." The gullible oaf Dufo would take any dares and fall for his gangs pranks time after time, and Cox would recount the awful consequences: "Sixteen stitches. What a crazy guy." Coxs decidedly different standup routine was infectious in its ridiculousness, and just as the studio audience had reached a peak of laughter, Cox suddenly switched gears, changed characters, and sang a high-pitched version of "The Drunkard Song" ("There Is a Tavern in the Town") punctuated by eccentric yodels. "Wallace Cox" earned a big hand that night, but lost by a narrow margin to The Chordettes, but he made enough of a hit to record his radio routine for an RCA Victor single. The "Dufo" routine ("What a Crazy Guy") was paired with "Tavern in the Town."<ref>Mad (magazine) MAD even animated the Dufo routine for its December 1957 issue; it is missing from the CD and DVD collections, but can be found at http://www.madcoversite.com/missing_dufo.html.</ref>
He appeared in Broadway musical reviews, night clubs, and early television comedy-variety programs between 1949 and 1951, including the short-lived (January–April 1949) DuMont Television Network DuMont series The School House and CBS Televisions Faye Emersons Wonderful Town starring Faye Emerson. Cox had a huge impact in 1951 with a starring role as a well-meaning but ineffective policeman on Philco Television Playhouse. Producer Fred Coe approached Cox about a starring role in a proposed live television sitcom, Mister Peepers, which he accepted. The show ran on NBC television NBC Television for three years. During this time, he guest-starred on NBCs The Martha Raye Show. In 1959, Cox was featured in the guest-starring title role in The Vincent Eaglewood Story on NBCs Western (genre) Western series, Wagon Train, with Read Morgan. Cox played a prominent supporting role as Preacher Goodman in the Earl Hamner novel brought to the screen, Spencers Mountain (1963). Cox played the role of a Navy sonar man in The Bedford Incident (1964) and the role of a drug-addicted doctor opposite Brando in the World War II suspense film, Morituri (1965 film) Morituri (1965).

Other roles were as the hero of The Adventures of Hiram Holliday, based on a series of Short story short stories by Paul Gallico and co-starring with Ainslie Pryor. He was a regular occupant of the upper left square on the television game show Hollywood Squares, and voiced the animated cartoon character Underdog (TV series) Underdog.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/whatever-happened-to-total-television-productions/ "Whatever Happened to Total TeleVision productions?," Hogans Alley #15, 2013]</ref><ref name=la-time-voice>{{cite news last1=King first1=Susan title=The Dog Days Return url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-06-21/news/tv-1171_1_dog-days accessdate=March 29, 2015 work=Los Angeles Times date=June 21, 1992}}</ref> He also was a guest on the game show Whats My Line? and on the Television pilot pilot episodes of Mission: Impossible and It Takes a Thief (1968 TV series) It Takes a Thief. Cox made several appearances on Heres Lucy, as well as The Beverly Hillbillies, Lost in Space, I Spy (1965 TV series) I Spy, and evening talk shows. He played a pickpocket in an episode of Car 54, Where Are You?. He also appeared on The Twilight Zone, season five, episode number 140, titled "From Agnes—With Love".

He played character roles in more than 20 motion pictures and worked frequently in guest-star roles in television drama, comedy, and variety series in the 1960s and early 1970s. These include a supporting role in the 20th Century Fox´s unfinished film Somethings Got to Give (1962), the last film of Marilyn Monroe. He was cast in a role as a down-on-his-luck prospector seeking a better life for his family in an episode of Alias Smith and Jones, a Western comedy, and Up Your Teddy Bear (aka Mother) (1970) in which he starred with Julie Newmar. His television and screen persona was that of a shy, timid, but kind man who wore thick eyeglasses and spoke in a pedantic, high-pitched voice.

Cox wrote a number of books, including Mister Peepers, a novel created by adapting several scripts from the television series; My Life as a Small Boy, an idealized depiction of his childhood; a parody and update of Horatio Alger in Ralph Makes Good, which was probably originally a screen treatment for an unmade film intended to star Cox; and a childrens book, The Tenth Life of Osiris Oakes.

==Personal life==
In a 1950s article on Coxs Mister Peepers TV show, Popular Science  reported that Cox kept a small workshop in his dressing room. (Coxs Hollywood Squares colleague, former Hollywood Squares "square-master" Peter Marshall (entertainer) Peter Marshall, recalled in his memoir, Backstage With The Original Hollywood Square, that Cox installed and maintained all the wiring in his own home.) Such misperceptions no doubt contributed to the sarcastic and peevish personality that Cox displayed as a comedian; they might also have helped inspire the character of Underdog, whose "Shoe-Shine Boy" persona, in the animated cartoons, reflected the kinds of roles Cox was often given.{{citation needed date=June 2015}}

TV viewers did, however, get to see a glimpse of Coxs physicality on an episode of Ive Got a Secret transmitted on May 11, 1960, in which he and host Garry Moore ran around on stage assembling furniture while the panel was blindfolded. On the May 15, 1974, installment of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson The Tonight Show, actor Robert Blake (actor) Robert Blake spoke of how much he missed his good friend Cox, who was described as being adventuresome and athletic. Cox married three times, to Marilyn Gennaro, Milagros Tirado, and Patricia Tiernan, and was survived by his third wife and his two children.<ref name="When the wild one met the mild one"/>

His close friendship with Marlon Brando was the subject of rumors. Brando told a journalist: "If Wally had been a woman, I would have married him and we would have lived happily ever after",<ref>Sellers, Robert Hollywood Hellraisers: The Wild Lives and Fast Times of Marlon Brando, Herman Graff Skyhorse Publishing 2010, p109</ref> and writer/editor Beauregard Houston-Montgomery said that while high on marijuana Brando said to him that Cox had been the love of his life.<ref>{{cite web  author=Saban, Stephen  title=Brando Sucks  publisher=World Of Wonder  date=February 2, 2006  url=http://worldofwonder.net/brando-sucks/  deadurl=no  accessdate=August 19, 2016}}</ref> However, two of Coxs wives dismissed the suggestion that the love was more than platonic.<ref name="When the wild one met the mild one"/>

Cox was 48 years old when he died of a Myocardial infarction heart attack on February 15, 1973, in his Hollywood, California, home.<ref name=obit>{{cite news  title=Wally Cox, TV Mr. Peepers, Dies at 48.
