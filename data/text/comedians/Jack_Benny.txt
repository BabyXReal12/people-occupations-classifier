Jack Benny (born {{nowrap Benjamin Kubelsky;}} February 14, 1894 â€“ December 26, 1974) was an American comedian, vaudeville vaudevillian, radio, television and film actor, and violinist. Recognized as a leading 20th-century American entertainer, Benny often portrayed his character as a miser, playing his violin badly, and claiming to be 39 years of age, regardless of his actual age.

Benny was known for his comic timing and the ability to cause laughter with a pregnant pause or a single expression, such as his signature exasperated "Well!" His radio and television programs, popular from 1932 until his death in 1974, were a major influence on the situation comedy sitcom genre.

Benny was born in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in nearby Waukegan, Illinois.
{{rp 6}} He was the son of Jewish immigrants Meyer Kubelsky and Emma Sachs Kubelsky. Meyer was a saloon owner and later a haberdasher who had emigrated to America from Poland.
Emma had emigrated from Lithuania. Benny began studying violin, an instrument that became his trademark, at the age of 6, his parents hoping for him to become a professional violinist. He loved the instrument, but hated practice. His music teacher was Otto Graham Sr., a neighbor and father of Otto Graham of NFL fame. At 14, Benny was playing in dance bands and his high school orchestra. He was a dreamer and poor at his studies, and was ultimately expelled from high school. He later did poorly in business school and at attempts to join his fathers business. In 1911, he began playing the violin in local vaudeville theaters for $7.50 a week.
