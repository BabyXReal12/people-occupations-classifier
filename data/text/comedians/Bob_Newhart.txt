Newhart was educated at Roman Catholic Church Roman Catholic schools in the Chicago area, including St. Catherine of Siena grammar school in Oak Park, and attended St. Ignatius College Prep (high school), graduating in 1947. He then enrolled at Loyola University of Chicago from which he graduated in 1952 with a bachelors degree in business management.

Newhart was drafted into the United States Army and served in the United States during the Korean War as a personnel manager until being discharged in 1954. Newhart briefly attended Loyola University Chicago School of Law, but did not complete a degree, in part, he says, because he was asked to behave unethically during an internship.<ref name=autobio/>

==Career==
After the war, Newhart worked for USG Corporation United States Gypsum as an accountant. He later said that his motto, "Thats close enough" and his habit of adjusting petty cash imbalances with his own money shows he did not have the temperament to be an accountant.<ref name=autobio/> He also said he was a clerk in the unemployment benefits unemployment office who made $55 a week, but who quit upon learning unemployment benefits were $45 a week and he "only had to come in to the office one day a week to collect it."<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/newhart_b.html title= Interview with Bob Newhart   publisher= PBS work= American Masters}}</ref>

===Comedy career beginnings===
In 1958, Newhart became an advertising copywriter for Fred A. Niles, a major independent film and television producer in Chicago.<ref name="MargaretMick2011">{{cite book   author1=Margaret Hicks   author2=Mick Napier   title=Chicago Comedy: A Fairly Serious History   url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8GB83XHjwh0C&pg=PA66   accessdate=November 24, 2012   date=May 2, 2011   publisher=The History Press   isbn=978-1-60949-211-3   page=66}}</ref> There, he and a co-worker entertained each other with long telephone calls about absurd scenarios, which they later recorded and sent to radio stations as audition tapes. When his co-worker ended his participation, Newhart continued the recordings alone, developing this type of routine. 

Dan Sorkin, a disc jockey at a radio station who later became the announcer-sidekick on Newharts NBC series, introduced Newhart to the head of talent at Warner Bros. Records. The label signed him in 1959, only a year after it was formed, based solely on those recordings. Newhart expanded his material into a stand-up comedy stand-up routine, which he began to perform at nightclubs.<ref name=autobio/>

===Albums===
Newhart became famous mostly on the strength of his audio releases, in which he played a solo "double act straight man". Newharts routine was to portray one end of a conversation (usually a phone call), playing the comedic straight man and implying what the other person was saying.

His 1960 comedy album, The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart, was the first comedy album to make number one on the Billboard (magazine) Billboard charts.<ref name=parade>{{cite news   title = In Step With: Bob Newhart   publisher = Parade Magazine   date = July 17, 2005   url = http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_07-17-2005/in_step_with_0   deadurl = yes   archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070315020844/http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_07-17-2005/in_step_with_0   archivedate = March 15, 2007   df =  }}</ref> The album received the Grammy Awards of 1961 1961 Grammy Award for Grammy Award for Album of the Year Album of the Year.

Newhart told a 2005 interviewer for Public Broadcasting Service PBSs American Masters that his favorite stand-up routine is "Abraham Lincoln Abe Lincoln vs. Madison Avenue", which appears on this album. In the routine, a slick promoter has to deal with the reluctance of the eccentric President to agree to efforts to boost his image. The routine was suggested to Newhart by Chicago TV director and future comedian Bill Daily, who was Newharts castmate on the 1970s The Bob Newhart Show for CBS. Newhart became known for using an intentional stammer, in service to his unique combination of politeness and disbelief at what he was supposedly hearing. Newhart has used the delivery throughout his career.

The follow-up album, The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back, was released six months later and won Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album Best Comedy Performance - Spoken Word that same year. Subsequent comedy albums include Behind the Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart (1961), The Button-Down Mind on TV (1962), Bob Newhart Faces Bob Newhart (1964), The Windmills Are Weakening (1965), This Is It (1967), Best of Bob Newhart (1971), and Very Funny Bob Newhart (1973). Years later, he released Bob Newhart Off the Record (1992), The Button-Down Concert (1997), and Something Like This (2001), an anthology of his 1960s Warner Bros. albums.

On December 10, 2015, it was revealed by publicist and comedy album collector Jeff Abraham that a "lost" Newhart track from 1965 about Paul Revere existed on a one-of-a-kind acetate, which he owns.  The track made its world premiere on episode 163 of the Comedy on Vinyl podcast.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://theinterrobang.com/199318-2/  title=Lost Bob Newhart Routine Airs Publicly for the First Time  date=December 10, 2015  website=The Interrobang  access-date=December 10, 2015}}</ref>

===Television===
Newharts success in stand-up led to his own short-lived NBC variety show in 1961, The Bob Newhart Show (1961 TV series) The Bob Newhart Show. The show lasted only a single season, but it earned Newhart a Primetime Emmy Award nomination and a Peabody Award. The Peabody Board cited him as:
{{Cquote a person whose gentle satire and wry and irreverent wit waft a breath of fresh and bracing air through the stale and stuffy electronic corridors. A merry marauder, who looks less like St. George than a choirboy, Newhart has wounded, if not slain, many of the dragons that stalk our society. In a troubled and apprehensive world, Newhart has proved once again that laughter is the best medicine.}}

In the mid-1960s, Newhart appeared on The Dean Martin Show 24 times, and on The Ed Sullivan Show eight times.<ref name=autobio/> He appeared in a 1963 episode of List of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour episodes The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, "How to Get Rid of Your Wife", and on The Judy Garland Show. Newhart guest-hosted The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson 87 times, and hosted Saturday Night Live twice, 15 years apart (1980 and 1995).

In addition to stand-up comedy, Newhart became a dedicated character actor. This led to other series such as: Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre, Captain Nice, two episodes of Insight, and Its Garry Shandlings Show. He reprised his role as Dr. Bob Hartley on Murphy Brown, and appeared as himself on The Simpsons, and as a retired forensic pathologist on NCIS (TV series) NCIS.

==Sitcoms==

===The Bob Newhart Show===
File:Newhart show cast 1977.JPG thumb right Standing, from left: Howard Borden, Carol Kester, Jerry Robinson, seated: Newhart and Emily Hartley
Newharts most notable exposure on television came from two long-running programs that centered on him. In 1972, soon after Newhart guest-starred on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, he was approached by his agent and his managers, producer Grant Tinker, and actress Mary Tyler Moore (the husband/wife team who founded MTM Enterprises), to work on a pilot series called The Bob Newhart Show, to be written by Davis and Music. He was very interested in the starring role of dry psychologist Bob Hartley, with Suzanne Pleshette playing his wry, loving wife, Emily, and Bill Daily as neighbor and friend Howard Borden.

The Bob Newhart Show faced heavy competition from the beginning, launching at the same time as the popular shows M*A*S*H (TV series) M*A*S*H, Maude (TV series) Maude, Sanford And Son, and The Waltons. Nevertheless, it was an immediate hit. The show eventually referenced what made Newharts name in the first place. Apart from the first few episodes, it used an opening-credits sequence featuring Newhart answering a telephone in his office. According to co-star Marcia Wallace, the entire cast got along well, and Newhart became close friends with both Wallace and co-star Suzanne Pleshette.

The cast also included Marcia Wallace as Bobs wisecracking, man-chasing receptionist, Carol Kester; Peter Bonerz as amiable orthodontist Jerry Robinson; Jack Riley (actor) Jack Riley as Elliot Carlin, the most misanthropic of Hartleys patients; character actor and voice artist, John Fiedler as milquetoast Emil Petersen; and Pat Finley as Bobs sister, Ellen Hartley, a love interest for Howard Borden. Future Newhart regular Tom Poston had a briefly recurring role as Cliff "Peeper" Murdock, veteran stage actor Barnard Hughes appeared as Bobs father for three episodes spread over two seasons, and Martha Scott appeared in several episodes as Bobs mother.

By 1977, the shows ratings were declining and Newhart wanted to end it, but was under contract to do one more season. The shows writers tried to rework the sitcom by adding a pregnancy, but Newhart objected: "I told the creators I didnt want any children, because I didnt want it to be a show about How stupid Daddy is, but we love him so much, lets get him out of the trouble hes gotten himself into." Nevertheless, the staff wrote an episode that they hoped would change Newharts mind. Newhart read the script and he agreed it was very funny. He then asked, "Who are you going to get to play Bob?"<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/newhart1.htm  title=The Bob Newhart Show &#124; A Television Heaven Review  publisher=Televisionheaven.co.uk  date=September 5, 1929  accessdate=December 11, 2011  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105210744/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/newhart1.htm  archivedate=January 5, 2012  df= }}</ref> Coincidentally, Newharts wife gave birth to their daughter Jenny late in the year, which caused him to miss several episodes.

In the last episode of the fifth season, not only was Bobs wife, Emily, pregnant, but his receptionist, Carol, was, too. In the first show of the sixth season, Bob revealed his dream of the pregnancies and that neither Emily nor Carol was really pregnant.

Marcia Wallace spoke of Newharts amiable nature on set: "Hes very low key, and he didnt want to cause trouble. I had a dog by the name of Maggie that I used to bring to the set. And whenever there was a line that Bob didnt like—he didnt want to complain too much—so, hed go over, get down on his hands and knees, and repeat the line to the dog, which invariably yawned; and hed say, See, I told you its not funny!" Wallace has also commented on the shows lack of Emmy recognition: "People think we were nominated for many an Emmy, people presume we won Emmys, all of us, and certainly Bob, and certainly the show. Nope, never!"

Newhart discontinued the series in 1978 after six seasons and 142 episodes. Wallace said of its ending, "It was much crying and sobbing. It was so sad. We really did get along. We really had great times together." Of Newharts other long-running sitcom, Newhart, Wallace said, "But some of the other great comedic talents who had a brilliant show, when they tried to do it twice, it didnt always work. And thats what... but like Bob, as far as Im concerned, Bob is like the Fred Astaire of comics. He just makes it look so easy, and hes not as in-your-face as some might be. And so, you just kind of take it for granted, how extraordinarily funny and how he wears well." She was later reunited with Newhart twice, once in a reprise of her role as Carol on Murphy Brown in 1994, and on an episode of Newharts short-lived sitcom, George & Leo, in 1997.

===Newhart===
File:Bob Newhart crop.jpg thumb left Newhart at the 1987 Emmy Awards
By 1982, Newhart was interested in a new sitcom. After he had discussions with Barry Kemp (TV producer) Barry Kemp and Columbia Broadcasting System CBS, the show Newhart was created, in which Newhart played Vermont innkeeper and TV talk show host Dick Loudon.  Mary Frann was cast as his wife, Joanna.  Jennifer Holmes was originally cast as Leslie Vanderkellen, but left after former daytime soap star Julia Duffy joined the cast as Dicks inn maid and spoiled rich girl, Stephanie Vanderkellen.  Peter Scolari (who had been a fan of Newharts since he was 17) was also cast as Dicks Psychological manipulation manipulative TV producer, Michael Harris, in six of the eight seasons. Character actor Tom Poston played the role of handyman George Utley, earning three Primetime Emmy Award nominations as Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1984, 1986, and 1987. Like The Bob Newhart Show, Newhart was an immediate hit, and again, like the show before it, it was also nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards, but failed to win any. During the time Newhart was working on the show, in 1985, his smoking habit finally caught up to him, and he was taken to the emergency room for secondary polycythemia. The doctors ordered him to stop smoking.

In 1987, ratings began to drop. Newhart ended in 1990 after eight seasons and 182 episodes. The last episode ended with a scene in which Newhart wakes up in bed with Suzanne Pleshette, who had played Emily, his wife from The Bob Newhart Show. He realizes (in a satire of a famous plot element in the television series Dallas (1978 TV series) Dallas a few years earlier) that the entire eight-year Newhart series had been a single nightmare of Dr. Bob Hartleys, which Emily attributes to eating Japanese food before he went to bed. Recalling Mary Franns buxom figure and proclivity for wearing sweaters, Bob closes the segment and the series by telling Emily, "You really should wear more sweaters" before the typical closing notes of the old Bob Newhart Show theme played over the fadeout. The twist ending was later chosen by TV Guide as the best finale in television history.

===Other TV series===

In 1992, Newhart returned to television with a series called Bob (TV series) Bob, about a cartoonist. An ensemble cast included Lisa Kudrow, but the show did not develop a strong audience and was cancelled shortly after the start of its second season, despite good critical reviews. (On The Tonight Show following the cancellation, Newhart joked he had now done shows called The Bob Newhart Show, Newhart and Bob so his next show was going to be called The.)

In 1997, Newhart returned again with George & Leo on CBS with Judd Hirsch and Jason Bateman (Newharts first name being George); the show was cancelled during its first season.

In 1995, a 65-year-old Newhart was approached by the Showtime (TV network) Showtime cable network to appear in the first comedy special in his 35-year career. His special Off The Record consisted of him performing material from his first and second albums in front of a live audience in Pasadena, California. In 2003, Newhart guest-starred on three episodes of ER (TV series) ER in a rare dramatic role that earned him an Primetime Emmy Award nomination, his first in nearly 20 years. In 2005, he began a recurring role in Desperate Housewives as Morty, the on-again/off-again boyfriend of Sophie (Lesley Ann Warren), Susan Mayers (Teri Hatcher) mother. In 2009, he received another Primetime Emmy nomination for reprising his role as Judson in The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice.

On August 27, 2006, at the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards, hosted by Conan OBrien, Newhart was placed in a supposedly airtight glass prison that contained three hours of air. If the Emmys went over the time of three hours, he would die. This gag was an acknowledgment of the common frustration that award shows usually run on past their allotted time (which is usually three hours). Newhart "survived" his containment to help OBrien present the award for Outstanding Comedy Series (which went to The Office (U.S. TV series) The Office).

During an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Newhart made a comedic cameo with members of ABCs show Lost (TV series) Lost lampooning an alternate ending to the series finale. In 2011, Newhart appeared in a small but pivotal role as a doctor in Lifetimes anthology film on breast cancer Five, and in 2013, he made a guest appearance on The Big Bang Theory as the aged Professor Proton (Arthur Jeffries), a former science TV show host turned childrens party entertainer, for which he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.<ref>[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/bob-newhart Bob Newhart   Television Academy].

At that years Emmy ceremony, Newhart appeared as a presenter with Big Bang Theory star Jim Parsons and received an unexpected standing ovation.

On December 19, 2014, Newhart made a surprise appearance on the final episode of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, where he was revealed to be the person inside Secretariat, Fergusons on-set pantomime horse. The show then ended with a scene parodying the Newhart series finale, with Ferguson and Drew Carey reprising their roles from The Drew Carey Show. In June 2015, Newhart appeared on another series finale, the final episode of Hot in Cleveland playing the father-in-law of Joy Scroggs (Jane Leeves). It marked a reunion with one time co-star Betty White who had been a cast member during the second season of Bob (TV series) Bob 23 years earlier. The finale ends with their characters getting married.

==Personal comedic style==
Newhart is known for his deadpan delivery and a slight Stuttering stammer which he incorporated early on into the persona around which he built a successful career.<ref name=autobio/> On his TV shows, although he got his share of funny lines, he worked often in the Jack Benny tradition of being the "straight man" while the sometimes rather bizarre cast members surrounding him got the laughs. Newhart, however, has stated that "I was not influenced by Jack Benny" in terms of his style or persona, and cites George Gobel and the comedy team of Bob and Ray as his initial writing and performance inspirations.<ref name="Thorn">Thorn, Jesse.

Several of his routines involve hearing one-half of a conversation as he speaks to someone over the phone. In a bit called "King Kong", a rookie security guard at the Empire State Building seeks guidance as to how to deal with an ape that is "between 18 and 19 stories high, depending on whether theres a Thirteenth floor 13th floor or not." He assures his boss he has looked in the guards manual "under ape and apes toes." Other famous routines include "The Driving Instructor", "The Mrs. Grace L. Ferguson Airline (and Storm Door Company)", "Introducing Tobacco to Civilization", "Abe Lincoln vs. Madison Avenue", "Defusing a Bomb" (in which an uneasy police chief tries to walk a new and nervous patrolman through defusing a live shell discovered on a beach), "The Retirement Party", "Ledge Psychology", "The Krushchev Landing Rehearsal", and "A Friend With a Dog."

In a 2012 podcast interview with Marc Maron, comedian Shelley Berman accused Newhart of plagiarizing his improvisational telephone routine style.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_332_-_shelley_berman title=Episode 332 - Shelley Berman work=WTF with Marc Maron Podcast}}</ref> However, in interviews both years before and after Bermans comments, Newhart has never taken credit for originating the telephone concept, which he has noted was done earlier by Berman and -- predating Berman -- Nichols and May, George Jessel (actor) George Jessel (in his well-known sketch "Hello Mama"), and in the 1913 recording "Cohen on the Telephone".  The technique would later also be used by Lily Tomlin, Ellen DeGeneres, and many others.<ref>{{cite news last=Martel first=Ned title=For Bob Newhart, Dean of Deadpan, the Laughs Go On url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/arts/television/12bob.html?_r=0 newspaper=New York Times date=April 12, 2005}}</ref><ref name="Thorn"/>
