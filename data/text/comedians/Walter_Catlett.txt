Catlett made a handful of silent film appearances, but his film career did not catch on until the advent of talking pictures allowed moviegoers to experience his full comic repertoire. Three of his most remembered roles were as the theatre manager driven to distraction by James Cagneys character in Yankee Doodle Dandy, the local constable who throws the entire cast in jail and winds up there himself in the Howard Hawks classic screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby, and as Morrow, the drunken poet in the restaurant who "knows when [hes] been a skunk" and takes Longfellow Deeds on a "bender" in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. The New York Times film critic Mordaunt Hall wrote that "This clever comedian runs away with the acting laurels" in Big City Blues (1932 film) Big City Blues (1932).<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C06EFD61231E633A25753C1A96F9C946394D6CF title=Big City Blues (1932)/Walter Catlett Affords Good Fun in "Big City Blues", the New Film at the Winter Garden. last=Hall first=Mordaunt work=The New York Times accessdate=November 18, 2014}}</ref>
