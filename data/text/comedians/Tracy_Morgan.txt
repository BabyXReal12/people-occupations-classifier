Tina Fey, Morgans boss both in fiction and in real life, said, "Im glad to hear that Tracy apologized .... but the violent imagery of Tracys rant was disturbing to me at a time when homophobic hate crimes continue to be a life-threatening issue for the LGBT community...the Tracy Morgan I know, ...is not a hateful man and [would never] hurt another person. I hope for his sake that Tracys apology will be accepted as sincere by his gay and lesbian co-workers at 30 Rock, without whom Tracy would not have lines to say, clothes to wear, sets to stand on, scene partners to act with or a printed-out paycheck from accounting to put in his pocket."<ref>{{cite web   title=30 Rocks Tina Fey and NBC honcho Bob Greenblatt respond to Tracy Morgans homophobic comments  date=June 10, 2011  work=Los Angeles Times  url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/06/30-rocks-tina-fey-and-nbc-honcho-bob-greenblatt-respond-to-tracy-morgans-homophobic-comments.html  first=Yvonne last= Villarreal}}</ref>

On June 25, 2011, during a show at Carolines on Broadway Carolines in New York City, Morgan made comments about disabled children, saying; "dont ever mess with women who have retarded kids,"<ref>{{cite news  first=Alexandra  last=Le Tellier  title=Tracy Morgan apologizes, then tries out a different offensive rant  work=Los Angeles Times  date=June 29, 2011  url= http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2011/06/tracy-morgan-new-offensive-rant.html }}</ref> and referred to a woman as "a cripple." Peter Bernes, CEO of The Arc, an organization supporting people with disabilities stated; "Tracy Morgan should apologize immediately. This quote is far too offensive to be excused as comedy, and it is very hurtful to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families. Mr. Morgan has an incredibly powerful platform from which to fix this, and if hes learned anything in the last few weeks, he cant bomb this apology." He never apologized.<ref>{{cite news  title=Tracy Morgan under fire again for cracking offensive jokes about the mentally disabled in NYC show  work= Daily News  date= June 29, 2011  first=Shari  last=Weiss  url= http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2011/06/29/2011-06-29_tracy_morgan_offensively_jokes_about_disabled_people_compares_young_retarded_mal.html }}</ref>

In 2012, Morgans mother, Alicia Warden, said her Youngstown, Ohio, home was on the verge of foreclosure as a result of being laid off from her job the previous year. Her home value at the time was estimated to be $28,000, and her request for help from Morgan resulted in an offer of a one-time gift of $2,000, which she refused. Morgan responded in a statement; "I am saddened that these untrue stories about me have people questioning my commitment to my family. For reasons that are between us, I have not seen my mother in 11 years and outside of a random call here and there have had little to no contact with my sister. We all have personal family issues that we have to deal with in life, but I choose to deal with mine in private and not through the media."<ref>{{cite web  title= Tracy Morgans mom: Im trying to find the answer  date=February 3, 2012  url=http://www.vindy.com/news/2012/feb/03/tracy-morgans-mom-im-trying-to-find-the-/  first=Guy last= DAlstolfo work=The Vindicator  location = Youngstown, Ohio accessdate=December 6, 2015  archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120205045144/http://www.vindy.com/news/2012/feb/03/tracy-morgans-mom-im-trying-to-find-the-/   archivedate=February 5, 2012  deadurl=no}}</ref>
Warden also reportedly attempted to visit Morgan in the hospital shortly after his 2014 traffic accident, but was turned away by hospital security and Wollover.  She said she returned the following day and was allowed five minutes with Morgan, who was still comatose at the time.<ref>Griffith, J. (June 11, 2014).
