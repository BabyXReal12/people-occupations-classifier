At the age of three his family moved to Saint-Jovite, Quebec and he was put in a boarding home where he learned to speak fluent French.  He disliked the experience so much that upon his return to Seattle 18 months later, he refused to speak the language except to translate for his younger sister, who only spoke French. He began acting as a child in the Seattle area doing community and school theater. As a teenager, he stumbled upon the film set of Scorchy (1976) in downtown Seattle.
