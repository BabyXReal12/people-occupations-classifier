In 1954, his college career was interrupted for two years when he was drafted into the United States Army. At the urging of his commanding officer, who had taken notice of his penchant for joking, Gregory got his start in comedy in the Army, where he entered and won several talent shows. In 1956, Gregory briefly returned to SIU after his discharge, but dropped out because he felt that the university "didnt want me to study, they wanted me to run."<ref>{{cite book last1=Otfinoski first1=Steven title=African Americans in the Performing Arts date=2014 publisher=Infobase Publishing isbn=1438107765 page=88}}</ref>

In the hopes of becoming a professional comedian, Gregory moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he became part of a new generation of black comedians that included Nipsey Russell, Bill Cosby, and Godfrey Cambridge, all of whom broke with the minstrel tradition that presented stereotypical black characters. Gregory drew on current events, especially racial issues, for much of his material: "Segregation is not all bad. Have you ever heard of a collision where the people in the back of the bus got hurt?"<ref name=Biography/>

Gregory began his career as a comedian while serving in the military in the mid-1950s. He served in the Army for a year and a half at Fort Hood in Texas,  Fort Lee (Virginia) Fort Lee in Virginia, and Fort Smith in Arkansas. He was drafted in 1954 while attending Southern Illinois University. After being discharged in 1956, he returned to the university but did not receive a degree. He moved to Chicago with a desire to perform comedy professionally.<ref name=Biography>{{cite web url=http://www.dickgregory.com/about_dick_gregory.html title=About – Dick Gregory Global Watch author=Flash work=dickgregory.com deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617034501/http://www.dickgregory.com/about_dick_gregory.html archivedate=June 17, 2007 df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 1958, Gregory opened the Apex Club nightclub in Illinois. The club failed and landed Gregory in financial hardship. In 1959, Gregory landed a job as master of ceremonies at the Roberts Show Club.<ref>[http://www.visionaryproject.org/gregorydick/ "Dick Gregory – National Visionary"], National Visionary Leadership Project.</ref>

While working for the United States Postal Service during the daytime, Gregory performed as a comedian in small, primarily black-patronized nightclubs. He was one of the first black comedians to gain widespread acclaim while performing for white audiences. In an interview with HuffPost The Huffington Post, Gregory described the history of black comics as limited: "Blacks could sing and dance in the white night clubs but werent allowed to stand flat-footed and talk to white folks, which is what a comic does."<ref>{{cite news last1=Saunders first1=Lonna title=Dick Gregory: "What Im Running From" Bryn Mawr College Feb. 28 url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lonna-saunders/dick-gregory_b_2756800.html accessdate=24 August 2017 publisher=Huffington Post date=29 April 2013}}</ref>

In 1961, Gregory was working at the black-owned Roberts Show Bar in Chicago when he was spotted by Hugh Hefner. Gregory was performing the following material before a largely white audience:

{{quote Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I understand there are a good many Southerners in the room tonight. I know the South very well. I spent twenty years there one night.

Last time I was down South I walked into this restaurant and this white waitress came up to me and said, "We dont serve colored people here." I said, "Thats all right. I dont eat colored people. Bring me a whole fried chicken."

Then these three white boys came up to me and said, "Boy, were giving you fair warning. Anything you do to that chicken, were gonna do to you." So I put down my knife and fork, I picked up that chicken and I kissed it. Then I said, "Line up, boys!"<ref>[http://www.duckProds.com/projects/dickgGregory Joke Gregory Told That Got Him Hired By High Hefner.]{{dead link date=December 2016 bot=InternetArchiveBot fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>}}

Gregory attributed the launch of his career to Hefner. Based on his performance at Roberts Show Bar, Hefner hired Gregory to work at the Chicago Playboy Playboy Club as a replacement for comedian "Professor" Irwin Corey.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/21/nyregion/21comicswe.html title=A Bit Slower, but Still Throwing Lethal Punch Lines first=Phillip last=Lutz work=The New York Times date=February 19, 2010}}</ref>

Early in his career, Gregory was offered an engagement on Tonight Starring Jack Paar.<ref name=Paar/> Jack Paar Paars show was known for helping propel entertainers to the next level of their careers. At the time, black comics did perform on the show, but after their performances, they were never asked to stay and sit on the famous couch and talk with the host.<ref name="nyt">{{cite web url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/19/arts/dick-gregory-dies-at-84.html title=Dick Gregory, 84, Dies; Found Humor in the Civil Rights Struggle last=Haberman first=Clyde date=19 August 2017 publisher=New York Times accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref> Dick Gregory declined several invitations from Jack Paar to perform on the show. Paar finally called him to find out why he refused to perform on his show. In order to have Gregory perform, the producers eventually agreed to allow him to stay after his performance and talk with the host on air.<ref name="nyt"/> This was a first in the shows history. Gregorys interview on Tonight Starring Jack Paar spurred conversations across America.<ref name=Paar/>

Gregorys comedy occasioned controversy in some conservative white circles. The administration of the University of Tennessee, for instance, branded Gregory an "extreme racist"<ref name="KNS-2017">Ernest Freeberg, [http://www.knoxnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/2017/09/07/inviting-controversy-when-tennessee-students-demanded-free-speech-rights-half-century-ago/625129001/ "Inviting Controversy: When Tennessee Students Demanded Free Speech Rights, a Half Century Ago"], Knoxville News Sentinel, Sept. 7, 2017.</ref> whose "appearance would be an outrage and an insult to many citizens of this state",<ref>G. Michel, Struggle for a Better South: The Southern Student Organization Committee, 1964-1969 (Springer 2004), p.183.</ref> and revoked his invitation by students to speak on campus. The students sued, with noted litigator William Kunstler as their counsel, and in Smith v. University of Tennessee, 300 F. Supp. 777 (E.D. Tenn. 1969), won an order from the court that the Universitys policy was "too broad and vague". The University of Tennessee then implemented an "open speaker" system, and Gregory subsequently performed in April, 1970.<ref name="KNS-2017" />

His take-away message to the students was to never accept injustice.

{{quote Once I accept injustice, I become injustice. For example, paper mills give off a terrible stench. But the people who work there dont smell it. Remember, Dr. King was assassinated when he went to work for Memphis sanitation strike garbage collectors. To help them as workers to enforce their rights. They couldnt smell the stench of the garbage all around them anymore. They were used to it. They would eat their lunch out of a brown bag sitting on the garbage truck. One day, a worker was sitting inside the back of the truck on top of the garbage, and got crushed to death because no one knew he was there.<ref name=Saunders/>}}

Even as late as 2013, Gregory continued to be a ringing voice of the Black Power black power movement. Towards the end of his life, he was featured in a Fantagraphics book by Pat Thomas entitled Listen, Whitey: The Sights and Sounds of Black Power 1965–1975, which uses the political recordings of the Civil Rights era to highlight sociopolitical meanings throughout the movement.<ref>[http://lightintheattic.net/releases/685-listen-whitey-the-sounds-of-black-power-1967-1974 "Listen, Whitey!

According to Thomas, Gregorys monologues reflect a time when entertainment needed to be political to be relevant, which is why he included his standup in the collection. Gregory is featured along with the likes of Huey P. Newton, Jesse Jackson, Martin Luther King Jr., Langston Hughes and Bill Cosby.<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-semioli/listen-to-this-book-the-s_b_4173930.html work=HuffPost The Huffington Post first=Tom last=Semioli title=Listen to This Book: The Sights and Sounds of Black Power 1965–1975 date=October 30, 2013}}</ref>

Gregory was active in the civil rights movement. On October 7, 1963, he came to Selma, Alabama, and spoke for two hours on a public platform two days before the voter registration drive known as "Freedom Day" (October 7, 1963).<ref>Howard Zinn, You Cant Be Neutral on a Moving Train. Beacon Press, 1994; rev. ed. 2002, p. 58.</ref>

In 1964, Gregory became more involved in civil rights activities, activism against the Vietnam War, economic reform, and anti-drug issues. As a part of his activism, he went on several hunger strikes and campaigns in America and overseas. In the early 1970s, he was banned from Australia, where government officials feared he was planning "stir up demonstrations."<ref>{{cite web url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&dat=19710910&id=0LsdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ikYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7222,2658601 last= Hart  first=Jeffrey   title=Evonne Goolagong Plays Tennis in South Africa  date=September 10, 1971 work=New York Daily News}}</ref>

In 1964, Gregory played a role in the search for three Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner missing civil rights workers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, who vanished in Philadelphia, Mississippi. After Gregory and members of Congress of Racial Equality CORE met with Neshoba County, Mississippi Neshoba County Sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey, Gregory became convinced that the Sheriffs office was complicit. With cash provided by Hugh Hefner, Gregory announced a $25,000 reward for information. The FBI, which had been criticized for inaction, eventually followed suit with its own reward, and the rewards worked. The bodies of the three men were found by the FBI 44 days after they disappeared.<ref>{{cite news title=How Dick Gregory Forced the FBI to Find the Bodies of Three Civil Rights Workers Slain in Mississippi url=http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/45776-how-dick-gregory-forced-the-fbi-to-find-the-bodies-of-three-civil-rights-workers-slain-in-mississippi date=September 14, 2017 accessdate=September 17, 2017 agency=http://readersupportednews.org/}}</ref>

Gregory began his political career by running against Richard J. Daley for Mayor of Chicago in 1967. Though he did not win, this would not prove to be the end of his participation in electoral politics.<ref name="guardian-19aug2017">{{cite news title=Dick Gregory, pioneering US comedian and activist, dies aged 84 url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/20/dick-gregory-pioneering-us-comedian-and-activist-dies-aged-84 accessdate=August 20, 2017 agency=Associated Press newspaper=The Guardian date=August 19, 2017}}</ref>

Gregory ran for President of the United States in 1968 as a write-in candidate of the Freedom and Peace Party, which had broken off from the Peace and Freedom Party. He garnered 47,097 votes, including one from Hunter S. Thompson,<ref>{{Cite book last=Thompson first=Hunter S. authorlink=Hunter S.

Gregory then wrote the book Write Me In about his presidential campaign. One anecdote in the book relates the story of a publicity stunt that came out of Operation Breadbasket in Chicago. The campaign had printed dollar bills with Gregorys image on them, some of which made it into circulation, causing considerable problems, but priceless publicity.  The majority of these bills were quickly seized by the federal government.<ref name="root-19aug2017"/> A large contributing factor to the seizure came from the bills resembling authentic United States currency enough that they worked in many dollar-cashing machines of the time. Gregory avoided being charged with a federal crime, later joking that the bills could not really be considered United States currency, because "everyone knows a black man will never be on a U.S. bill."<ref>{{cite news last1=Evans first1=Bradford title=8 Memorable Political Campaigns by Comedians url=http://splitsider.com/2011/08/8-memorable-political-campaigns-by-comedians/ accessdate=24 August 2017 publisher=Splitsider date=31 August 2011}}</ref>

Shortly after this time, Gregory became an outspoken critic of the John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories findings of the Warren Commission concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald. On March 6, 1975, Gregory and assassination researcher Robert J. Groden appeared on Geraldo Riveras late night ABC talk show Goodnight America. An important historical event happened that night when the famous Zapruder film of JFKs assassination was shown to the public on TV for the first time.<ref>{{YouTube 4DwKK4rkeEM Zapruder film on Good Night America – 3/6/75 Robert Groden and Dick Gregory}}.</ref> The publics response and outrage to its showing led to the forming of the Hart-Schweiker investigation, which contributed to the Church Committee Investigation on Intelligence Activities by the United States, which resulted in the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations investigation.

Gregory was an outspoken feminist, and in 1978 joined Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan, Bella Abzug, Margaret Heckler, Barbara Mikulski, and other suffragists to lead the National ERA March for Ratification and Extension, a march down Pennsylvania Avenue to the United States Capitol of over 100,000 on Womens Equality Day (August 26), 1978, to demonstrate for a ratification deadline extension for the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution, and for the ratification of the ERA.<ref name="vibe-19aug2017">{{cite magazine last1=Muhammad first1=Latifah title=Dick Gregory, Comedic Legend And Civil Rights Activist, Dead At 84 url=https://www.vibe.com/2017/08/dick-gregory-comedian-activist-dead-at-84/ accessdate=August 20, 2017 magazine=Vibe (magazine) Vibe date=August 19, 2017}}</ref> The march was ultimately successful in extending the deadline to June 30, 1982, and Gregory joined other activists to the Senate for celebration and victory speeches by pro-ERA Senators, Members of Congress, and activists. The ERA narrowly failed to be ratified by the extended ratification date.

On July 21, 1979, Gregory appeared at the Amandla Festival where Bob Marley, Patti LaBelle, and Eddie Palmieri, amongst others, performed.<ref name="boston-24may2017">{{cite web last1=Eaton first1=Perry title=Long before Boston Calling, there was the Amandla Festival url=https://www.boston.com/culture/music/2017/05/24/long-before-boston-calling-amandla-festival-brought-bob-marley-and-social-justice-to-harvard website=Boston.com accessdate=August 20, 2017 date=May 24, 2017}}</ref> Gregory gave a speech before Marleys performance, blaming President Jimmy Carter Carter, and showing his support for the international Anti-Apartheid Movement. Gregory and Mark Lane conducted landmark research into the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., helping move the U.S. House Select Assassinations Committee to investigate the murder, along with Assassination of John F. Kennedy that of John F. Kennedy. Lane was the author of conspiracy theory books such as Rush to Judgment.
