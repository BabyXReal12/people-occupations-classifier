He said the shock of being told he had two years to live prompted him to reevaluate how he took care of himself, and explained that he decided to lose weight in order to insure his continued presence in the lives of his loved ones. Iglesias described the struggle to incorporate a healthier lifestyle, relating how he was told by a specialist that his heavy touring schedule precluded him from being a candidate for bariatric surgery, and how he resorted instead to weight-lifting, DDP Yoga Diamond Dallas Page Yoga, and a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet, which helped him shed over {{Convert 100 lb kg abbr=off}}.
