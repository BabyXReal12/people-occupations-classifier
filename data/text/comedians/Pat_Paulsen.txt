==Early life and education==
Paulsen was born in South Bend, Washington, a small fishing town in Pacific County, Washington Pacific County. He was the son of Beulah Inez (née Fadden) and Norman Inge Paulsen, a Norwegian immigrant who worked for the United States Coast Guard Coast Guard.<ref name="paulsenbio">{{cite web  url=http://www.paulsen.com/bio1.html  title=Pat Paulsen Biography  work=Paulsen.com  accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref><ref name="Whos who">{{cite book last=Armstrong first=Alice Catt title=Whos who in California, Volume 26 publisher=Whos Who Historical Society year=1997 pages=363}}</ref> When he was 10, the family moved to California.

After graduating from Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley in May 1945, Paulsen immediately joined the United States Marine Corps United States Marines. World War II was still being waged at that time, but it ended before he was shipped overseas. However, he did experience overseas duty, including guarding captured Japanese soldiers during their repatriation.<ref name="paulsenbio"/> He returned home after the war and worked as a posting clerk, a truck driver, a Brick hod hod carrier, a Fuller Brush salesman, and a gypsum miner. Later, he was employed as a photostat operator for several years. After attending San Francisco City College, Paulsen joined an acting group called "The Ric-y-tic Players," and he formed a comedy trio that included his brother Lorin.

Paulsen went on to become a solo act, appearing as a comedic guitarist in various clubs on the West Coast and in New York City. During one of his appearances in San Francisco, he met the Smothers Brothers.

The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour premiered in 1967. Paulsen said he was hired because he sold them inexpensive songs and would run errands. At first, he was cast as their editorialist, and his deadpan, gibberish double-talk comments on the issues of the day propelled him into the national consciousness. (His deadpan work was nearly flawless: on one isolated occasion, in a talk about Hawaii, he defined a "wahine" as something you put on a bun bu-hun with lots of Mustard (condiment) mu-hustard. His composure started to crack, but he recovered.) His work on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour earned Paulsen an Emmy Award Emmy in 1968.<ref name="Grimes">{{cite news  first=William  last=Grimes  authorlink=William Grimes (journalist)  url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E2D61631F935A15757C0A961958260 title=Pat Paulsen, 69, a Parodist Of Presidential Doubletalk  newspaper=The New York Times date=April 26, 1997}}</ref>

In addition to his work with the Smothers Brothers, Paulsen made a memorable guest appearance on The Monkees (TV series) The Monkees, appearing in the 1967 episode "Monkees Watch Their Feet," playing the Secretary of National Defense. He also made many appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.

In 1968, Paulsen appeared as timid, tenderfoot Federal Agent Bosley Cranston in "The Night of the Camera," Season 4/Episode 10 of The Wild Wild West. Pats character had a photographic memory and ended up with the "girl(s)," much to the surprise of agents James West (Robert Conrad) and Jeremy Pike (Charles Aidman).

During the inaugural season of Sesame Street (1969–1970), Paulsen appeared in a series of comical skits: reciting the alphabet, and fumbling on a few of the letters; counting to 10 and to 20, and forgetting a few of the numbers; and talking about the word "full" with a wastebasket full of wastepaper that falls out the bottom of the basket, forcing him to talk about the word "empty" instead.

He was prominently featured in the 1970 Get Smart episode "Get Smart (season 5)#Episodes The Mess of Adrian Listenger."

Early in 1970, Paulsen headlined his own series, Pat Paulsens Half a Comedy Hour, which ran 13 weeks on ABC. Guests on the first show were former US Vice President Hubert Humphrey, and an animated Daffy Duck, whom Paulsen interviewed.

In 1971, Paulsen performed in the play Play It Again, Sam (play) Play It Again, Sam at Cherry County Playhouse  in Traverse City, Michigan. He enjoyed this professional summer-stock theater so much that, in 1976, he became business partners with television writer and producer Neil Rosen and bought Cherry County Playhouse.  He starred in a production every summer, with the exception of 1973, all the way through the 1995 season. He ended up starring in 24 different plays, including The Fantasticks, The Odd Couple (play) The Odd Couple, Harvey (play) Harvey, and The Sunshine Boys. Also, during these later years, he appeared in nightclubs, theaters, and conventions throughout the country.

In 1984, Paulsen costarred in the film Night Patrol, a vehicle for The Unknown Comic.

==Political campaigns==
Paulsen was approached by the Smothers Brothers with the idea of running for president in 1968. His reply, he was later to recount, was, "Why not? I cant dance—besides, the job has a good pension plan, and Ill get a lot of money when I retire." The dance crack was a reference to actor/dancer George Murphy, then a U.S. senator representing California.

Paulsens campaign in 1968, and in succeeding years, was grounded in comedy, although not without serious commentary. He ran the supposed campaigns using obvious lies, double talk, and tongue-in-cheek attacks on the major candidates, and he responded to all criticism with his catchphrase "Picky, picky, picky." His campaign slogan was, "Just a common, ordinary, simple savior of Americas destiny."  Every question on social issues received basically the same response: "I feel that it is too directly bound to its own anguish to be anything other than a cry of negation, carrying within itself the seeds of its own destruction. However, to get to the meat of the matter, I will come right to the point, and take note of the fact that the heart of the issue in the final analysis escapes me."<ref>{{cite book  last=Williams  first=Mason  authorlink=Mason Williams  title=Pat Paulsen for President  publisher=Kragen/Fritz  year=1968  page=131  asin=B0007ET48I}}</ref>

Paulsens name appeared on the ballot in New Hampshire for the Democratic primary several times. In 1996, he received 921 votes (1%) to finish second to President Bill Clinton (76,754 votes); this was actually ahead of real politicians such as Buffalo mayor James D. Griffin. In 1992, he came in second to George H. W. Bush George Bush in the North Dakota Republican Primary. In the Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1992 1992 Republican Party primaries, he received 10,984 votes total.

==Winemaking==

In 1971, Paulsen and his wife opened Pat Paulsen Vineyards, a successful vineyard and winemaking operation in Sonoma County, California.<ref>http://www.ppvwines.com/pages/about-us</ref> Shortly after the actor Clint Eastwood won election as mayor of Carmel, California, Paulsen invented the office of "mayor" of Asti, the small town near his vineyard, and proclaimed himself to have assumed the office.<ref>articles.latimes.com/1986-05-18/local/me-21025_1_comedian-pat-paulsen</ref>

==Personal life and death==
In the 1980s, Paulsen struck up a relationship with a social worker, Linda Chaney, whom he met at a Denver comedy club. Chaney soon began serving as Paulsens booking agent, and in 1988 Paulsen and Chaney married. However, Paulsen was notified that she was diverting his funds into her own personal accounts, and he filed for divorce after only 40 days. He later sued Chaney and was awarded a judgement of $233,000, about which Chaney said that, even if she had the money, she would rather "go out and shred it rather than turn it over" to Paulsen.<ref name=People>{{cite news last1=Sanz first1=Cynthia first2=Dan  last2=Knapp title=Stalked by Tax Woes, Pat Paulsen Tries to Keep His Whine Sparkling url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113677,00.html accessdate=26 March 2015 work=People Magazine issue=34.20 date=19 November 1990}}</ref>
