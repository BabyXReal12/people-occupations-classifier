Thomas Andrew Lehrer ({{IPAc-en ˈ l ɛər ər}}; born April 9, 1928) is a retired American musician, singer-songwriter, satire satirist, and mathematician. He has lectured on mathematics and musical theater. He is best known for the pithy, humorous songs he recorded in the 1950s and 1960s.

Lehrer’s work often parodies popular song forms, though he usually creates original melodies when doing so. A notable exception is The Elements (song) The Elements, where he sets the names of the chemical elements to the tune of the Major-Generals song from Gilbert and Sullivans Pirates of Penzance. Lehrers early work typically dealt with non-topical subject matter and was noted for its black humor in songs such as Poisoning Pigeons in the Park. In the 1960s, he produced a number of songs that dealt with social and political issues of the day, particularly when he wrote for the U.S. version of the television show That Was the Week That Was. Despite their topical subjects and references, the popularity of these songs has endured; Lehrer quoted a friends explanation: "Always predict the worst and youll be hailed as a prophet."
In the early 1970s, he mostly retired from public performances to devote his time to teaching mathematics and music theatre at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
