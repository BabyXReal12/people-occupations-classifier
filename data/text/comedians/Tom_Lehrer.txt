Thomas Andrew Lehrer ({{IPAc-en ˈ l ɛər ər}}; born April 9, 1928) is a retired American musician, singer-songwriter, satire satirist, and mathematician. He has lectured on mathematics and musical theater. He is best known for the pithy, humorous songs he recorded in the 1950s and 1960s.

Lehrer’s work often parodies popular song forms, though he usually creates original melodies when doing so. A notable exception is The Elements (song) The Elements, where he sets the names of the chemical elements to the tune of the Major-Generals song from Gilbert and Sullivans Pirates of Penzance. Lehrers early work typically dealt with non-topical subject matter and was noted for its black humor in songs such as Poisoning Pigeons in the Park. In the 1960s, he produced a number of songs that dealt with social and political issues of the day, particularly when he wrote for the U.S. version of the television show That Was the Week That Was. Despite their topical subjects and references, the popularity of these songs has endured; Lehrer quoted a friends explanation: "Always predict the worst and youll be hailed as a prophet."<ref>{{cite episode last=Ford first=Andrew title=Tom Lehrer series=The Music Show transcript=Interview transcript transcripturl=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/musicshow/tom-lehrer/3344656#transcript date=July 8, 2006 station=Radio National network=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>

In the early 1970s, he mostly retired from public performances to devote his time to teaching mathematics and music theatre at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

==Academic and military career==
Lehrer earned his Bachelor of Arts in mathematics (Latin honors magna cum laude) from Harvard University in 1946.<ref>{{cite web url=http://dmdb.org/lehrer/bio.html  title=Tom Lehrer Biography  publisher=Dmdb.org  date=  accessdate=2015-10-27}}</ref> He received his Master of Arts MA degree the next year, and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa Society Phi Beta Kappa.{{Citation needed date = April 2018}} He taught classes at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT, Harvard, Wellesley College Wellesley, and the University of California, Santa Cruz.{{Citation needed date = April 2018}}

He remained in Harvards doctoral program for several years, taking time out for his musical career and to work as a researcher at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. He was drafted into the U.S. Army from 1955 to 1957, working at the NSA. (Lehrer has stated that he invented the Jell-O shots Jell-O Shot during this time, as a means of circumventing liquor restrictions.)<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2000-04-19/news/that-was-the-wit-that-was/  title=That Was the Wit That Was  first=Jack  last=Boulware  work=SF Weekly  date=2000-04-19  accessdate=2013-05-23}}</ref> These experiences became fodder for songs, e.g., The Wild West Is Where I Want to Be and It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1U2fpzw4qNI  title=The Wild West Is Where I Want To Be: spoken introduction  first=Tom  last=Lehrer  work=The Remains of Tom Lehrer  date=2000-05-23  accessdate=2018-08-15}} </ref> It was many years before Lehrer publicly revealed having been assigned to the NSA, since the mere fact of its existence was classified at the time; this left him in the interesting position of implicitly using nuclear weapons work as a cover story for something more sensitive.

Despite holding a masters degree in an era when American conscripts often lacked a high school diploma, Lehrer served as an enlisted soldier, achieving the rank of Specialist (rank) Specialist Third Class (later retitled "Specialist-4" and currently "Specialist"), which he described as being a "Corporal#United States Army corporal Minister without portfolio without portfolio."<ref>Monologue self-introduction on Tom Lehrer Revisited.</ref> In 1960, Lehrer returned to full-time studies at Harvard,<ref name=toobin/> but in 1965 gave up on his mathematical dissertation about the subject of Mode (statistics) modes in statistics, after working on it intermittently for 15 years.<ref name=bensmith/>

From 1962, he taught in the political science department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).<ref>{{cite web url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200709/  title=Tom Lehrer  archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709231900/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200709/  archivedate=July 9, 2012  last=Longley  first=Eric  work=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture  publisher=CBS Interactive Resource Library  deadurl=yes  df= }}</ref> In 1972, he joined the faculty of the University of California, Santa Cruz, teaching an introductory course entitled The Nature of Mathematics to liberal arts majors—"math for tenors," according to Lehrer. He also taught a class in musical theater.

===Mathematical publications===
The American Mathematical Society database lists him as co-author of two papers:

==Musical career==
===Style and Influences ===
Lehrer was mainly influenced by musical theater. According to Gerald Nachman (journalist) Gerald Nachmans book Seriously Funny,<ref>{{cite book  last1= Nachman  first1=Gerald  author-link1= Gerald Nachman (journalist)  title=Seriously Funny  script-title=The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B_Yzl5uXacwC  location=New York, NY  publisher=Pantheon Books  publication-date=2003  pages=659  isbn=  9780375410307 <!-- 0375410309 -->  oclc=50339527   trans-title=  author-mask1=  date=  year= 2004 orig-year=  editor1-last=  editor1-first=  editor1-link=  editor1-mask=  display-editors=  format=  type=  language=  edition=  page=  access-date=  quote=  postscript=  ref= }}</ref> the Broadway musical Lets Face It! (by Cole Porter) made an early and lasting impression on him. Lehrers style consists of Parody music parodying various forms of popular song. For example, his appreciation of list songs led him to write The Elements (song) The Elements, which lists the chemical elements to the tune of Gilbert and Sullivans Major-Generals Song.

In author Isaac Asimovs second autobiographical volume In Joy Still Felt, he recounted seeing Lehrer perform in a Boston nightclub on October 9, 1954. Lehrer sang cleverly about Jim getting it from Louise, and Sally from Jim, "...and after a while you gathered the it was venereal disease [the song was likely I Got It From Agnes I Got It From Sally (in later versions Agnes)]. Suddenly, as the combinations grew more grotesque, you realized he was satirizing every known perversion without using a single naughty phrase. It was clearly unsingable (in those days) outside a nightclub." Asimov also recalled a song that dealt with the Boston subway system, making use of the stations leading into town from Harvard, observing that the local subject-matter rendered the song useless for general distribution. Lehrer subsequently granted Asimov permission to print the lyrics to the subway song in his book. "I havent gone to nightclubs often," said Asimov, "but of all the times I have gone, it was on this occasion that I had by far the best time."<ref>Asimov, Isaac, In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954–1978. Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1980, p. 15.</ref>

===Recordings===

In 1953, inspired by the success of his performances, Lehrer paid $15 for some studio time to record Songs by Tom Lehrer. The initial pressing was 400 copies.  At the time, radio stations would not air Lehrers songs because of his controversial subjects. He sold his album on campus at Harvard for $3 (equivalent to ${{Formatprice {{Inflation US 3 1953}}}} today), while "several stores near the Harvard campus sold it for $3.50, taking only a minimal markup as a kind of community service. Newsstands on campus sold it for the same price."<ref name=barryhansen>
{{citation title=Too many Facts about Tom Lehrer author=Dr. Demento authorlink=Dr. Demento series=The Remains of Tom Lehrer publisher=Warner Bros Records year=2000}}
</ref> After one summer, he started to receive mail orders from all parts of the country (as far away as San Francisco, after San Francisco Chronicle The Chronicle wrote an article on the record). Interest in his recordings spread by word of mouth. Friends and supporters played their records for friends, who then also wanted a copy.<ref name="Jim Bessman 1997">Jim Bessman. "Rhino Reissues Lehrers Seminal Songs Albums". Billboard. June 21, 1997.</ref>  Lehrer later recalled, "Lacking exposure in the media, my songs spread slowly.  Like herpes, rather than ebola."<ref>Maslon, Laurence, Make Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America, Hachette Book Group, 2008, pg. 81</ref>

The album—which included the macabre I Hold Your Hand in Mine, the mildly risqué Be Prepared, and Lobachevsky (song) Lobachevsky (regarding plagiarizing mathematicians)—became a cult success via word of mouth, despite being Self-publishing self-published and without promotion. Lehrer embarked on a series of concert tours, and recorded a second album in 1959. He released the second album in two versions: the songs were the same, but More of Tom Lehrer was studio-recorded while An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer was recorded live in concert.  In 2013, Lehrer recalled the studio session for Poisoning Pigeons in the Park, which referred to the practice of controlling pigeons in Boston with strychnine-treated corn:<ref name="faulkner">{{Cite paper  last=Faulkner  first=Clarence  date=1999-05-01  title=As It Was in Region 5,1949-1964  url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=icwdmprobe  journal=The Probe  volume=200  pages=7  via=DigitalCommons@University of Nebraska - Lincoln, "City-wide pigeon control in Boston, MA using strychnine-treated whole corn"}}</ref>

:"The copyist arrived at the last minute with the parts and passed them out to the band... And there was no title on it, and there was no lyrics.  And so they ran through it, what a pleasant little waltz... And the engineer said, "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park, take one," and the piano player said, "What?" and literally fell off the stool."<ref name=bbc>{{cite web url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rqb1w  title=BBC Radio 4 – Tom Lehrer at 85  publisher=The British Broadcasting Corporation  date=2013-04-06  accessdate=2013-05-23}}</ref>

===Touring===

Lehrers major breakthrough in the United Kingdom came with the doctor of music honoris causa, which the University of London conferred to Princess Margaret on 4 December 1957 "in the full knowledge," as the public orator Professor J.R. Sutherland stated, "that the Princess is a connoisseur of music and a performer of skill and distinction, her taste being catholic, ranging from Mozart to the Calypso music calypso and from opera to the songs of Miss Beatrice Lillie and Tom Lehrer."<ref>East Africa and Rhodesia 1957 [https://books.google.com/books?id=h64qAAAAMAAJ&q=lehrer  p.493 books.google]<br />

British Pathé quoted only „from Mozart to calypso“ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7KVCLZuC58 youtube.com]</ref>
This prompted significant interest in Lehrers works and helped secure distributors for his material in the UK. It was there that his music achieved real popularity, as a result of the proliferation of university newspapers referring to the material, and the willingness of the BBC to play his songs on the radio (something that was a rarity in the United States). By the end of the 1950s, Lehrer had sold 370,000 records.<ref name=bensmith/>

===That Was The Week That Was===

In 1960, Lehrer essentially retired from touring in the US.<ref name=bensmith/> In the early 1960s, he was employed as the resident songwriter for the U.S. edition of That Was The Week That Was (TW3), a satirical television show.<ref name=barryhansen/>
{{anchor NewMath}}<!-- this anchor referenced by Andrew Gleason -->
An increased proportion of his output became overtly political, or at least topical, on subjects such as education ("New Math (song) New Math"), the Second Vatican Council (The Vatican Rag, a tune some say is based on the 1910 Spaghetti Rag by Lyons and Yosco<ref>{{cite web  url=http://bccsa.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/case-no-40-2013.pdf  title=BAIOCCHI vs CLASSICAL FM  author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  date=27 November 2013  website=bccsa.co.za  publisher=Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa  access-date=23 September 2016  quote= The Registrar received a complaint concerning the broadcasting of a song called Vatican Rag during a time slot identified for classical comedy on 13 September 2013. The song was written and performed by satirist Tom Lehrer in the early 1960s. The music dates from 1910 and was then known the Spaghetti Rag.}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube PBR9hsNS0dg}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://cudl.colorado.edu/luna/servlet/detail/UCBOULDERCB1~78~78~1062427~137286:Spaghetti-rag title=University of Colorado Digitsal Sheet Music Collection: Spaghetti Rag accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>), race relations (National Brotherhood Week), air and water pollution (Pollution), American militarism (Send the Marines), World War III "pre-nostalgia" (So Long, Mom, premiered by Steve Allen), and nuclear proliferation (Whos Next? and MLF Lullaby). He also wrote a song that satirized the alleged amorality of rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, who worked for Nazi Germany before working for the United States. ("Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down? Thats not my department, says Wernher von Braun.") Lehrer did not appear on the television show—a female vocalist, Nancy Ames, performed his songs—and network censors often altered his lyrics. Lehrer later performed the songs on the album That Was The Year That Was (1965) so that, in his words, people could hear the songs the way they were intended.
In 1966, David Frosts further BBC television programme The Frost Report invited Lehrer to contribute some of his classic compositions. The Frost Report was transmitted live, and he pre-recorded all his segments at one performance. Though Lehrer was not featured in every edition, his songs featured in an appropriate part of each show. At least two of his offerings were songs not included on any of his LPs: a reworking of Noël Coward’s That is the End of the News (with some new lyrics) and a comic explanation of how Britain might adapt to the Decimal Day coming of decimal currency.

In the spring of 1960, Lehrer toured Australia and New Zealand, performing a total of 33 concerts to great acclaim.<ref name=barryhansen/>
Yet this occurred during a time in which he was "banned, censored, mentioned in several houses of parliament and threatened with arrest," after which he quipped that it was "the highlight of his life."  In particular, Be Prepared drew advance brickbats in Brisbane from the chief of police, which he sang anyway, prompting wrath in Adelaide where he signed a petition that he wouldnt sing five songs in that territory.  Nonetheless, Lehrer debuted several unreleased songs in Australia including The Masochism Tango which couldnt yet be banned.<ref>{{cite web title=Stop clapping, this is serious url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/28/1046407753895.html publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald date=March 1, 2003}}</ref>
 
In 1967, Lehrer was persuaded to make a short tour in Norway and Denmark, where he performed some of the songs from the television program. The performance in Oslo, Norway, on September 10 was recorded on video tape and aired locally later that autumn; this program was released on DVD some 40 years later. On that tour, a concert at the Studenterforeningen (student association) in Copenhagen, Denmark, where a prominent international guest was invited annually, was also televised; Lehrer commented onstage that he might be Americas "revenge for Victor Borge."<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/6funswede  title=The Tom Lehrer Wisdom Channel  publisher=YouTube  date=1967-09-11  accessdate=2015-10-27}}</ref>

In the summer of 1967, Lehrer composed and performed on piano original songs in a Dodge automobile industrial film distributed primarily to automobile dealers and shown at promotional events.  Set in a fictional American wild west town, the full title is The Dodge Rebellion Theatre presents Ballads For 67.<ref name=barryhansen/><ref>{{cite web title=The Dodge industrial Film url=http://home.broadpark.no/~emeyn/tl/dodge.html website=The Tom Lehrer Wisdom Channel}}</ref>

Working with Joe Raposo, Lehrer attempted to adapt Sweeney Todd as a Broadway musical to star Jerry Colonna (entertainer) Jerry Colonna. They started a few songs but, as Lehrer noted, "Nothing ever came of it, and of course twenty years later Stephen Sondheim beat me to the punch." <ref name="Todd">{{cite book last1=Nachman first1=Gerald title=Seriously funny the rebel comedians of the 1950s and 1960s date=2003 publisher=Pantheon Books location=New York isbn=0307490726 page=149 url=https://books.google.com/?id=45tG8jqrx5oC&lpg=PA149&pg=PA149#v=onepage&f=false accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref>

The record deal with Reprise Records for the That Was The Year That Was album also gave Reprise distribution rights for his earlier recordings, as Lehrer wanted to wind up his own record imprint. The Reprise issue of Songs by Tom Lehrer was a stereo re-recording. This version was not issued on CD, but the songs were issued on the live Tom Lehrer Revisited CD. The [live] recording included bonus tracks L-Y and Silent E, two of the ten songs that Lehrer wrote for the PBS childrens educational series The Electric Company (1971 TV series) The Electric Company. Lehrer later commented that worldwide sales of the recordings under Reprise surpassed 1.8 million units in 1996. That same year, the album That Was The Year That Was went gold.<ref name="Jim Bessman 1997"/>  The album liner notes (and Lehrer himself in one routine) promote his songs with self-deprecating humor.  ("I know its very bad form to quote ones own reviews, but there is something the New York Times said about me [in 1958], that I have always treasured: Mr. Lehrers muse [is] not fettered by such inhibiting factors as taste.")

===Departure from the music scene===
In the 1970s, Lehrer concentrated on teaching mathematics and musical theater, although he also wrote ten songs for the educational childrens television show The Electric Company. His last public performance took place in 1972, on a fundraising tour for Democratic US presidential candidate George McGovern.<ref name=bensmith/>

There is an urban legend that Lehrer gave up political satire when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Henry Kissinger in 1973. He did comment that awarding the prize to Kissinger made political satire obsolete,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/10/29/645761/-Tom-Lehrer-supports-Obama-Who-Tom-Lehrer-Who-Tom-Lehrer# title=Tom Lehrer supports Obama !

When asked about his reasons for abandoning his musical career in an interview in the book accompanying his CD box set (released in 2000), he cited a simple lack of interest, a distaste for touring, and boredom with performing the same songs repeatedly. He observed that when he was moved to write and perform songs, he did, and when he was not, he did not, and that after a while he simply lost interest. Even though Lehrer was "a hero of the anti-nuclear, civil rights left," and covered its political issues in many of his songs, and even though he shared the New Lefts opposition to the Vietnam war, he disliked the aesthetics of 1960s counterculture and stopped performing as the movement gained momentum.<ref name=bensmith/>

Lehrers musical career was brief. He pointed out that he had performed a mere 109 shows and written 37 songs over 20 years.<ref>{{cite web last=Andrews  first=Dale  url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/search/label/Tom%20Lehrer  title=Tom Lehrer  publisher=SleuthSayers  date=2013-04-09  accessdate=2015-10-27}}</ref> Nevertheless, he developed a significant following in the United States and abroad.

===Revivals and discographic reissues===
In 1980 Tom Foolery, a revue of his songs created and produced by Cameron Mackintosh, was a hit on the London stage.  Although not its instigator, Lehrer eventually gave the stage production his full support and updated several of his lyrics for the show (such as Whos Next, in which Neiman-Marcus [or in the San Francisco production, J.C. Penney], not Alabama, gets the bomb). Tom Foolery contained 27 songs and led to more than 200 productions,<ref name="Jim Bessman 1997"/> including an Off-Broadway production at the Village Gate, which ran for 120 performances in 1981.<ref>{{iobdb title 2186 Tomfoolery}}</ref>

In conjunction with the Tom Foolery premiere in 1980 at the Criterion Theatre in London, Lehrer made a rare TV appearance on BBCs Parkinson (TV series) Parkinson show, where he sang "I Got It from Agnes".<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/43413/tom-lehrer-collection-cd-dvd-the/  title=The Tom Lehrer Collection (CD + DVD) : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video  publisher=Dvdtalk.com  date=  accessdate=2015-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube EDeRYmB4t6Q Tom Lehrer: I Got It From Agnes}}—from "Parkinson" 1980</ref>

In 1993, Lehrer wrote Thats Mathematics for the closing credits to a Mathematical Sciences Research Institute video<ref>{{cite web title=Fermats Last Theorem - The Theorem and Its Proof: An Exploration of Issues and Ideas url=http://videodl.msri.org/data/000/022/041/original/fermat-fermat-QuickTime.mov website=MSRI publisher=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute location=Palace of Fine Arts, San Francisco date=July 28, 1993}}</ref> celebrating the proof of Fermats Last Theorem.

On June 7 and 8, 1998, Lehrer performed in public for the first time in 25 years at the Lyceum Theatre, London as part of the gala show Hey, Mr. Producer! celebrating the career of impresario Cameron Mackintosh, who had been the producer of Tom Foolery. The June 8 show was his only performance to date before Elizabeth II Queen Elizabeth II. Lehrer sang Poisoning Pigeons in the Park and an updated version of the nuclear proliferation song "Whos Next?  The DVD of the event includes the former song.<ref>{{YouTube yhuMLpdnOjY Poisoning Pigeons in the Park}} (original version). Retrieved March 25, 2008.</ref>

In 2000 a boxed set of CDs, The Remains of Tom Lehrer, was released by Rhino Entertainment. It included live and studio versions of his first two albums, That Was The Year That Was, the songs he wrote for The Electric Company, and some previously unreleased material. It was accompanied by a small hardbound book containing an introduction by Dr. Demento and lyrics for all the songs.

In 2010, Shout! Factory launched a reissue campaign, making his long out-of-press albums available digitally. They also issued a CD/DVD combo called The Tom Lehrer Collection, which includes his best-loved songs, plus a DVD featuring an Oslo concert.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126189232  title=Tom Lehrer: 60s Satirist Still Strikes A Chord  publisher=NPR  date=2010-04-30  accessdate=2015-10-27}}</ref>

===Musical legacy===
Sardonic composer Randy Newman said of Lehrer, "Hes one of the great American songwriters without a doubt, right up there with everybody, the top guys.

Lehrer was praised by Dr. Demento as "the best musical satirist of the twentieth century." Other artists who cite Lehrer as an influence include "Weird Al" Yankovic, whose work generally addresses more popular and less technical or political subjects,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/faq.htm  title=Weird Als FAQs  author="Weird Al" Yankovic  authorlink="Weird Al" Yankovic publisher=Weirdal.com  date=  accessdate=June 12, 2009  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518102319/http://weirdal.com/faq.htm  archivedate=May 18, 2008  df= }}</ref> and educator and scientist H. Paul Shuch, who tours under the stage name Dr. SETI and calls himself "a cross between Carl Sagan and Tom Lehrer: he sings like Sagan and lectures like Lehrer."<ref>{{cite web title=SETI League url=http://www.setileague.org/admin/paul.htm}}</ref>

Lehrer has commented that he doubts his songs had any real effect on those not already critical of the establishment: "I dont think this kind of thing has an impact on the unconverted, frankly. Its not even preaching to the converted; its titillating the converted... Im fond of quoting Peter Cook, who talked about the satirical Berlin kabaretts of the 1930s, which did so much to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the Second World War."<ref name="avclub" />

In 2003 he commented that his particular brand of political satire is more difficult in the modern world: "The real issues I dont think most people touch. The Clinton jokes are all about Monica Lewinsky and all that stuff and not about the important things, like the fact that he wouldnt ban land mines... Im not tempted to write a song about George W. Bush. I couldnt figure out what sort of song I would write. Thats the problem: I dont want to satirise George Bush and his puppeteers, I want to vaporize them."<ref name="smh" />

Gene Weingarten of the Washington Post interviewed Lehrer off the record in a February 2008 phone call. When Weingarten asked if there was anything he could print for the record, Lehrer responded, "Just tell the people that I am voting for Barack Obama Obama."<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2008/02/05/DI2008020502027.html  title=Chatological Humor: A Tribute to Tom Lehrer  publisher=The Washington Post  date=February 12, 2008  accessdate=2015-10-27}}</ref>

The play Letters from Lehrer by Canadian Richard Greenblatt (playwright) Richard Greenblatt was performed by him at CanStage in Toronto, from January 16 to February 25, 2006. It followed Lehrers musical career, the meaning of several songs, the politics of the time, and Greenblatts own experiences with Lehrers music, while playing some of Lehrers songs. There are currently no plans for more performances, although low-quality audio recordings have been on the internet.

Stylistically influenced performers include American political satirist Mark Russell,<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.holecity.com/asp/newshole.asp?issue=10&sec=7&hole=1  title=NewsHole  publisher=Holecity.com  date=2000-03-05  accessdate=June 12, 2009  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013212746/http://holecity.com/asp/newshole.asp?issue=10&sec=7&hole=1  archivedate=October 13, 2007  df=mdy-all }}</ref> Canadian comedian and songwriter Randy Vancourt and the British duo Kit and The Widow. British medical satirists Amateur Transplants acknowledge the debt they owe to Lehrer on the back of their first album, Fitness to Practice. Their songs The Menstrual Rag and The Drugs Song are to the tunes of Lehrers The Vatican Rag and The Elements (the tune of the Major-Generals Song from The Pirates of Penzance by Gilbert and Sullivan) respectively. Their second album, Unfit to Practise, opens with an update of Lehrers The Masochism Tango called Masochism Tango 2008.

In 1967, Swedish actor Lars Ekborg, outside Sweden most known for his part in Ingmar Bergmans Summer with Monika made an album called I Tom Lehrers vackra värld ("In the beautiful world of Tom Lehrer"), with 12 of Lehrers songs interpreted in Swedish. Lehrer wrote in a letter to the producer Per–Anders Boquist that, "Not knowing any Swedish, I am obviously not equipped to judge, but it sounds to me as though Mr Ekborg is perfect for the songs," along with further compliments to pianist Leif Asp for unexpected additional flourishes.<ref>Liner notes (translation): {{cite book last1=Holmgren first1=Pontus title=Lars Ekborg i Tom Lehrers Vackra Värld date=2002 publisher=Amigo location=Sweden url=http://www.tomlehrer.org/covers/ekborgnotes1.html deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621060642/http://www.tomlehrer.org/covers/ekborgnotes1.html archivedate=June 21, 2015 df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Lehrers song The Old Dope Peddler is sampled in rapper 2 Chainzs song Dope Peddler, on his 2012 debut album, Based on a T.R.U. Story.  The following year, Lehrer said he was "very proud" to have his song sampled "literally sixty years after I recorded it."  Lehrer went on to describe his official response to the request to use his song: "As sole copyright owner of The Old Dope Peddler, I grant you motherfuckers permission to do this.  Please give my regards to Mr. Chainz, or may I call him 2?"<ref name=bbc /><ref>{{cite magazine

Lehrer has said of his musical career, "If, after hearing my songs, just one human being is inspired to say something nasty to a friend, or perhaps to strike a loved one, it will all have been worth the while."<ref name="Songs 1997" />
