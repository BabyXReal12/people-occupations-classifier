When Kennedy first arrived in Los Angeles, he became a professional Hollywood extra. During his first night in L.A., he was reading a Joan Rivers autobiography in a diner when the waiter explained to him that he had been in a dozen movies as an extra.

After a few years of struggling, Kennedy was unable to find an agent and worked as a host at Red Lobster (restaurant) Red Lobster. He auditioned for over 80 commercials and could not book one.
