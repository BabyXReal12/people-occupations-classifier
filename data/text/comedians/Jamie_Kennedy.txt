After high school, Kennedy began his career as a Hollywood, California Hollywood extra. Meanwhile, he worked on voice impersonations.

==Career==
When Kennedy first arrived in Los Angeles, he became a professional Hollywood extra. During his first night in L.A., he was reading a Joan Rivers autobiography in a diner when the waiter explained to him that he had been in a dozen movies as an extra. Kennedy asked, "If youve been in so many movies, why are you a waiter?" The waiter responded, "I have to keep my day job."{{citation needed date=May 2016}}

After a few years of struggling, Kennedy was unable to find an agent and worked as a host at Red Lobster (restaurant) Red Lobster. He auditioned for over 80 commercials and could not book one. He then took a job as a telemarketer, and learned that he had a talent in selling things. Kennedy then thought that if he could sell anything, "why not sell myself?", becoming his own agent.{{citation needed date=May 2016}}

Kennedy created a false persona, screen agent "Marty Power", to attract the attention of real agents and managers over the phone, who would later book his performances. He came to prominence in the late 1990s for playing Randy Meeks in the Scream (film series) Scream film series.<ref>{{cite web url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3333303/interview-jamie-kennedy-talks-buddy-hutchins-tremors-5/  title=Jamie Kennedy Talks ‘Buddy Hutchins’ and ‘Tremors 5′  publisher=BloodyDisgusting.com  date=2010-04-27  accessdate=2012-03-30}}</ref> His lead role as Tim Avery in Son of the Mask earned him a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actor.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://razzies.com/forum/topic668_page1.html  title=2005 RAZZIE Nominees & "Winners"  publisher=Razzies.com  date=  accessdate=2012-03-30  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228195941/http://www.razzies.com/forum/topic668_page1.html  archive-date=2012-02-28  dead-url=yes  df= }}</ref>
