Along with fellow vloggers Alex Day Nerimon on YouTube, Liam Dryden Littleradge, and former member Chris Beattie (CowInParachute), Chameleon Circuit released their self-titled debut album on 1 June 2009.<ref>{{cite web  title=Music – Chameleon Circuit – DFTBA Records LLC  url=http://dftba.com/shop/categories/Music/Chameleon-Circuit/  publisher=DFTBA records  accessdate=7 November 2009  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403201219/http://dftba.com/shop/categories/Music/Chameleon-Circuit  archivedate=3 April 2010  df=dmy-all }}</ref> In July 2010, their song Count the Shadows also appeared on DFTBA Records, Volume Two, a compilation sampler that was given for free in the grab bags at VidCon 2010.<ref>{{cite web  title=Available for FREE, exclusively at VidCon  url=http://dailybooth.com/alandistro/4981569  accessdate=14 August 2010  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523220934/http://dailybooth.com/alandistro/4981569  archivedate=23 May 2010  df=dmy-all }}</ref> At the beginning of 2011, Chameleon Circuit, in their new line-up following the departure of Beattie and the addition of Ed Blann (Eddplant) and Michael aranda Michael Aranda, began work on their second album Still Got Legs. It was released on 12 July 2011.<ref>{{cite web  title=Music – Chameleon Circuit – DFTBA Records LLC  url=http://dftba.com/shop/categories/Music/Chameleon-Circuit/  publisher=DFTBA records  accessdate=15 June 2011  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403201219/http://dftba.com/shop/categories/Music/Chameleon-Circuit  archivedate=3 April 2010  df=dmy-all }}</ref>

As of 2014, Chameleon Circuit have been on an apparent indefinite hiatus, after both McDonnell and Dryden publicly denounced members Blann and Day, who have both suspended their online careers following separate reported incidents of sexual abuse.<ref>{{cite web  title=Sexual Abuse, Consent, and Losing Friends  url=http://charliemcdonnell.com/sexual-abuse-consent-and-losing-friends/  publisher=Charlie McDonnell   accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  title=Liam Dryden • On This Week.  url=http://liamdryden.tumblr.com/post/79554089056/on-this-week  accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref> McDonnell, Dryden and Aranda appeared together at VidCon 2014 for photo signings.<ref>{{cite web  title=Signings - VidCon 2014  url=http://vidcon.com/signings  publisher=VidCon 2014  accessdate=13 July 2014  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714203143/http://vidcon.com/signings  archivedate=14 July 2014  df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Sons of Admirals===
In 2010, McDonnell, along with three other YouTubers, Alex Day ("nerimon"), Ed Blann ("eddplant") and Tom Milsom ("Hexachordal") formed a new project titled "Sons of Admirals". Their first single was released via YouTube on 14 June 2010 on McDonnells channel. The group covered Cat Stevens Cat Stevens song "Here Comes My Baby (Cat Stevens song) Here Comes My Baby" featuring all four members on vocals. The track peaked at No.&nbsp;61 in the UK.<ref>[http://www.polyhex.com polyhex]. polyhex. Retrieved on 2011-12-28.</ref> <br>In October 2010 the band released an EP including "Here Comes My Baby"; an acoustic version of the same song; a cover of "Believe in Yourself", the theme of childrens television show Arthur (TV series) Arthur; the music video of "Here Comes My Baby"; and a behind-the-scenes video. The band has been known to perform a cover of "Youre Not There", written by Ed Blann, and a cover of Radioheads "Creep (Radiohead song) Creep".<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/here-comes-my-baby-ep/id399010503 iTunes – Music – Here Comes My Baby – EP by Sons of Admirals]. Itunes.apple.com (2010-10-25). Retrieved on 2011-12-28.</ref>

Sons of Admirals was not a band in the traditional sense. They were all solo artists, but as well as having their solo careers, they came together to form one group. The idea and name inspiration for this came from the Admirals Men, which was a Shakespearean group of actors that came together to perform, while still retaining their individual careers.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slIyXbXYX4o Sons of Admirals on The 5:19 Show!]. YouTube. Retrieved on 2011-12-28.</ref>

Sons of Admirals disbanded in May 2011, publishing a statement on their website that "the core goal of the group – to get into the charts, and to increase exposure for the group members individual talents proved to run against too many of our beliefs and approaches to music and promotion".<ref>{{cite web url=http://sonsofadmirals.com/ title=Sons of Admirals Website accessdate=24 June 2011}}</ref>

===Solo career===

A prominent feature of McDonnells YouTube channel are the songs which he writes and performs himself, usually on a ukulele, but also featuring other instruments such as the guitar, melodica, and—in one song—a kazoo and a xylophone made of filled water glasses.  The most popular of these is "Duet with Myself."  On 1 December 2010, in response to many fan requests to do so, he released his debut album titled This is Me via DFTBA Records.  The album features several songs from his channel that was remixed for the album, as well as several new, previously unreleased songs.<ref>{{cite web title=This is Me (CD) url=http://dftba.com/product/wz/This-Is-Me-CD}}</ref>
