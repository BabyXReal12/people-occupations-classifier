María del Rosario Mercedes Pilar Martínez Molina Baeza,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.charo.com/?page_id=14 title=The Official Charo Website accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref> professionally known simply by her stage name Charo, is a Spanish-American<!-- U.S. citizen --> actress, comedian, and flamenco guitarist.

Charo began playing guitar at the age of nine and trained under the famed Andrés Segovia. In 1966, she married bandleader Xavier Cugat and they moved to the United States. In the late 1960s and 1970s, she became a ubiquitous presence on American television, frequently appearing as a guest star on series like Laugh-In, Fantasy Island, and The Love Boat. She is known for her uninhibited and exuberant manner, ostensible lack of fluency in English, and heavy Spanish accent, and the catch-phrase "cuchi-cuchi". 

As a musician, she has performed and recorded in various styles for five decades. She released a series of disco recordings in the 1970s with Salsoul Records, most notably Dance a Little Bit Closer (1977). In 1995, her flamenco album Guitar Passion (1994) won the Female Pop Album of the Year award at the Billboard International Latin Music Conference and was named best female Latin pop album by Billboard (magazine) Billboard.<ref name=":0">Kariann Goldschmitt.

==Life==
===Early life===
Born as María del Rosario Mercedes Pilar Martínez Molina Baeza, her official date of birth is listed as January 15, 1951 (though original documents from Spain report her birth date as March 13, 1941)<ref>https://www.biography.com/people/charo-262379</ref> in Molina de Segura, Region of Murcia, Spain. Her father was reportedly a lawyer who fled to Casablanca during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, while her homemaker mother stayed behind in Murcia, raising their children.{{citation needed date=July 2015}}

Charo has occasionally claimed that she was enrolled in a convent as a young child and remained there until she was 15, when a nun stated that she belonged in show business.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19820510&id=E4c1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=-aQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5466,4615896&hl=en "Coochie-coochie comedienne wants to be zee dramatic actress"], Montreal Gazette, May 10, 1982.</ref> In the most colorful version of this childhood, Charos grandmother hired a music professor to give her weekly classical guitar lessons, and he became the first man to enter the convent.<ref>[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1974/04/29/page/52/article/shes-dynamite "Shes dynamite: You might say Charos rather un-convent-ional"], Chicago Tribune, April 29, 1974.</ref>

Most sources indicate that she studied classical and flamenco guitar in a school in Madrid founded by Andrés Segovia for underprivileged children.{{citation needed reason=It is well known that Segovia disliked flamenco and would not give his support to flamenco teaching; classical, certainly. date=March 2016}} In a 2005 interview, she reminisced: "The institution had great young teachers and students. Everything was a charity. Mr. Segovia, between concerts thats when hed come, and if youd been there a year and you werent good, youd go out and they would give your place to another young kid."<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Ageless-Charo-keeps-the-cuchi-cuchi-flame-burning-2618338.php, "Ageless Charo keeps the cuchi cuchi flame burning"], San Francisco Chronicle, August 6, 2005.</ref>
Charo has stated in several interviews that she graduated with honors at age 16.<ref>[http://napavalleyregister.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/charo-she-s-more-than-just-miss-cuchi-cuchi/article_d07fcb8a-bb0d-11df-b137-001cc4c03286.html "Charo: Shes more than just miss Cuchi, Cuchi"], Napa Valley Register, September 8, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2012/03/29/2008706/beyond-cuchi-cuchi.html "Charo: Beyond cuchi cuchi], San Luis Obispo Tribune, March 29, 2012</ref>

Charo was discovered as a young performer by bandleader Xavier Cugat, whom she later wed on 7 August 1966. When they married, Cugat was 66 and had already been married four times (Rita Montaner, Carmen Castillo, Lorraine Allen and Abbe Lane) although reports sometimes listed fewer marriages. An April 1966 column by Earl Wilson (columnist) Earl Wilson on the couples wedding plans announced, "Sixty-year-old {{sic}} Xavier Cugat and his 20-year-old {{sic}} Spanish girlfriend and singing star Charo hope to marry in Sant Cugat del Vallès San Cugat, Spain, in a few days if Cugat can convince church authorities his two divorces should not be counted against him since he wasnt married in church."<ref name="beck"/>

The couple was the first to have their wedding nuptials in Caesars Palace in Las Vegas Strip Las Vegas. She later claimed that her marriage to Cugat had been merely a business contract, a way for him to legally bring her over to the United States where he was based.<ref name="laopinion">[http://www.laopinion.com/print.html?rkey=00050215152722648163 "Fin del cuchi cuchi, principio del arte"], La Opinión Digital, February 17, 2005 {{es icon}} {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023222/http://www.laopinion.com/print.html?rkey=00050215152722648163 date=September 27, 2007}}</ref>

She moved to West 257th Street in The Bronx, New York with her mother and aunt, and was regularly featured in shows with Cugats orchestra in New York and Las Vegas, as well as in overseas engagements in Latin America and Europe. She claims he was confident in her eventual success from early on, and that she gave him a Rolls-Royce (car) Rolls-Royce as a parting gift once she legally came of majority age. {{citation needed date=November 2010}}

===Career===
{{BLP sources section date=June 2018}}
Charos first US TV appearance was on Today (NBC program) The Today Show. From 1965-67, she performed on The Ed Sullivan Show four times with her husband Xavier Cugat and his orchestra. She appeared on Laugh-In in 1968. She would appear on short chatfests for a few minutes near the end of the show with Dan Rowan and Dick Martin (comedian) Dick Martin. Her almost complete lack of fluency in the English language was played as a comic focus, with the two hosts laughing at her mangled English. It was around this time that she began using "cuchi cuchi" in the public arena.

====1970s====
She was headlining Vegas shows by 1971 and reportedly being paid as much as Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles or Dean Martin. In 1977, she became a naturalized citizen of the United States. That same year she filed for divorce from Cugat, a petition that was granted April 14, 1978.<ref name="divorce">Roger Piantadosi. "Personalities" (column), The Washington Post, April 15, 1978, page C3.</ref>

On August 11, 1978, she married her second husband, Kjell Rasten, a producer, in Lake Tahoe South Lake Tahoe, California, in a civil ceremony attended by 30 guests.<ref name="rasten">Ellen Goldman and Joseph P. Mastrangelo. "Personalities" (column), The Washington Post, August 15, 1978, p. C1</ref> Rasten soon became his wifes manager and the couple has one child, a son, Shel Rasten (born 1981), who is the drummer for the heavy metal band Treazen.{{citation needed date=March 2017}}

Throughout the 1970s, she was a highly visible personality, appearing eight times on The Love Boat, as well as on variety and talk shows such as Donny & Marie (1976 TV series) Donny & Marie,<ref name="cc-dandm">Donny & Marie broadcast listings, "Channel Choices", The Dallas Morning News, February 27, 1976, pg.

In 1975, Dallas Morning News critic Harry Bowman wrote that the American Broadcasting Company ABC network had "penciled in ... a half-hour comedy starring the uninhibited wife of Xavier Cugat" and commented, "This is probably the worst idea of the season."<ref name="uninhibited">Harry Bowman. "New season guessing" ("Broadcast Beat" column), The Dallas Morning News, April 22, 1975, pg. A12</ref> By October of that year, the performer was promoting a special slated for November,<ref name="wilson101375">Earl Wilson. "Hackett Teaching Charo" (column), The Dallas Morning News, October 13, 1975, pg. D5.</ref> but the special did not actually appear until May 1976.<ref name="bowman2">Harry Bowman.

A TV listing for August 24, 1976, shows what appears to be an unsold pilot airing on ABC at 8:30 pm Central Standard Time CST: "Charo and the Sergeant - Situation comedy starring Charo Cugat. Charos first U.S. job is to be a dancer at an off-limits night club and her conservative United States Marine Corps Marine Corps husband finds out. The few episodes that were taped ended up being broadcast on the American Armed Forces Network overseas."<ref name="cc-pilot">"Channel Choices," The Dallas Morning News, August 24, 1976, pg. B5.</ref>

By the late 1970s, Charo was being mentioned as an example of how overexposure could damage a celebrity. One such article quoted the "Q score" of Performer Q, Steve Levitts celebrity popularity rating service, to show that the performers popularity declined slightly even as her familiarity increased:{{quote Before she gained national fame on talk shows in 1975, bosomy Latina starlet Charo was recognized by 57 percent of Levitts national television sample and had a popularity quotient of 9 percent. Today, known by 80 percent, a figure as high as Clint Eastwoods 80 percent, Charos popularity is 8 percent. If she was known by 100 percent of the world, chances are her popularity might go down to 7 or 6 percent, Levitt says coolly. That paradox makes some performers think twice when invitations to talk shows come in. "The TV Talk Shows", Washington Post, July 14, 1977 (Style section, pg.  B1)}}

====Post-1970s====
For much of the late 1980s and 1990s, Charo had limited visibility as she moved to Hawaii and opened and performed at her own dinner theater while she and Rasten raised their son. Because of the large number of people of Japanese descent in Hawaii, Charo learned to speak Japanese.<ref>{{cite web title=Charo: Still Cuchi-Cuchi-ing date=May 8, 1998 last=Silverman first=Stephen M. publisher=People.com url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,619238,00.html accessdate=Mar 4, 2010}}</ref>

In the 2000s, she returned to television in commercials for Sprint Nextel Sprint wireless phone service and GEICO GEICO insurance, as well as guest appearances on Hollywood Squares, a season-three stint on the celeb-reality series The Surreal Life, portraying herself on an episode of Fox Networks That 70s Show, and appearances in VH1s I Love the 70s: Volume 2 I Love the 70s retrospectives. On May 11, 2008, she made a guest appearance on the Latin-themed VH1 reality show Viva Hollywood.{{citation needed date=January 2016}}

==Year of birth controversy==
Charos year of birth has been the subject of Age fabrication#Actors dispute for many years. Official documents in Charos birthplace of Murcia, her original Spanish passport, and her naturalization papers state that her birth date is March 13, 1941. After immigrating to the United States, Charo said that she was born in 1947, then changed it to 1949.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19860809&id=HosfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IWMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3829,4124801&hl=en "These stars keep tight rein on real ages"], The Pittsburgh Press, August 9, 1986.</ref> She asserted in a 1977 court hearing that her passport and naturalization papers were wrong and that her true date of birth was January 15, 1951.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.revistavanityfair.es/celebrities/articulos/charo-baeza-murcia-xavier-cugat-los-simpson-vacaciones-en-el-mar/21754 title=La mujer que conquistó EE.UU. sin que nadie en España se enterase date=15 January 2016 publisher=}}</ref>

The performer has said in interviews that her parents allowed her to falsify her age to appear older when marrying 66-year-old band leader Xavier Cugat in 1966, although according to her later claims, that would have made her 15 at the time. However as noted previously, she has stated in many interviews that she was attending school in Madrid at that age and graduated at 16, not having yet begun her performing career. She has never clarified the obvious discrepancy.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1966/08/08/archives/cugat-weds-charo-in-las-vegas.html Cugat Weds Charo in Las Vegas], nytimes.com; accessed March 13, 2016.</ref><ref name="beck">John Beck.
