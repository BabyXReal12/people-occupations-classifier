==Controversy==

===Down syndrome===
In 2007, some families of people with Down syndrome complained about a routine in his act about people with the condition.<ref name="ii-routine-controversy">[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/comic-refuses-to-drop-down-syndrome-jokes-1231118.html "Comic refuses to drop Down Syndrome jokes"], 27 November 2007, retrieved 23 September 2009.</ref> It had caused some surprise to some of the families as Tiernan has run a marathon in support of Down Syndrome Ireland.<ref name="ii-routine-controversy"/>

===The Late Late Show (2008)===
An appearance on The Late Late Show in 2008 led to complaints about his jokes involving a methadone user, eastern European immigrant accents, buying a motorbike from  an injured biker, and a film idea about gay Irish Traveller Traveller spacemen seeking a cure for gayness, eight of which were upheld by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.
Previous routines which went largely without remark included a comic reference to disproportionate American reaction to 9/11 and a long comic repetition on the indifferent Israeli people Israeli attitude to foreign criticism of Israeli occupations of surrounding land.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120803192605/http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/tiernans-traveller-joke-leads-to-uproar-1513476.html Tiernans Traveller joke leads to uproar], Geraldine Gittens, Evening Herald, 30 October 2008, retrieved 23 September 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0108/bcc.html BCC upholds complaints against RTÉ show], RTÉ News, 8 January 2009, retrieved 23 September 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.bcc.ie/decisions_details/Dec%202008/383%2008%20pavee%20point%20Late%20Late%20Show%20rte%20dec08.doc Complaint made by:  Mr. B.

===Holocaust remarks===
In September 2009, while attending a pre-performance public question and answer session at Electric Picnic in County Laois, Tiernan responded to a question concerning antisemitism by making remarks about the Holocaust and comments about Jewish deicide Jews and the death of Christ while he was interviewed by Olaf Tyaransen. He was responding to an audience member who asked if he had ever been accused of antisemitism.<ref name="tribune"/>

Tiernan stated that a comedian should not be looked to for political correctness, and then went on to say:<ref name="eh-ot"/>"These Jews, these fucking Jew cunts come up to me. Fucking Christ-killing bastards. Fucking six million? I would have got 10 or 12 million out of that. No fucking problem! Fuck them."<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%27TIERNAN+MUST+SAY+SORRY+FOR+HURTFUL+JEWISH+SLUR%27+Israeli+official...-a0209018503 TIERNAN MUST SAY SORRY FOR HURTFUL JEWISH SLUR] – The Mirror, 5 October 2009</ref> He later suggested in several interviews that his points were intended as a commentary on how somebodys words can easily be taken out of context when a small segment of a dialogue is quoted.

The response of the audience was criticised by Alan Shatter as "disappointing" and also said "I would regard it as particularly sad that people found that sort of outburst in any way amusing".<ref name="tribune">[http://www.tribune.ie/news/article/2009/sep/20/six-million-i-would-have-got-10-or-12-million-out-/ "Six million? I would have got 10 or 12 million out of that. No f**kng problem! F**k them. Two at a time, they would have gone. Hold hands, get in there! Leave us your teeth and your glasses"] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924211113/http://www.tribune.ie/news/article/2009/sep/20/six-million-i-would-have-got-10-or-12-million-out-/  date=24 September 2009 }}, Ken Sweeney, Entertainment Editor, Sunday Tribune, 20 September 2009</ref>

Tommy Tiernan released a statement that said he had not meant to cause offence and that his words had been taken out of context.<ref name="tiernan-statement">[http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/09/22/9657/words_were_not_meant_to_wound Words were not meant to wound], chortle.co.uk, retrieved 22 September 2009</ref> He said that the comments were part of an attempt to explain his belief that comedians have a duty to be irresponsible and reckless, to allow "whatever lunacy is within you to come out" and that they should never be taken out of context.<ref name="tiernan-statement"/> He added that the statements that had caused controversy had been preceded by a statement not to take the rant seriously.<ref name="tiernan-statement"/>

Diarmuid Martin Archbishop Diarmuid Martin also criticised the remarks, describing them as "offensive to the Jewish community", "offensive to all who feel revulsion concerning the Holocaust, one of the most horrific events in human history” and “I can only decry the comments as insensitive and hurtful to the suffering of the victims and to a memory which is sacred".<ref name="it-archbishop-and-heti-criticise-tiernan">[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0923/1224255064144.html "Remarks on Holocaust offensive, says archbishop"], Patsy McGarry, The Irish Times, 23 September 2009.</ref>

Holocaust Education Trust Ireland condemned Tiernans statements as "appalling".<ref name="it-archbishop-and-heti-criticise-tiernan"/> Ruairi Quinn, chairman of the Trust, said that "as someone in the public eye, he has to take responsibility for his racist comments. We are equally concerned about the report of the audience’s reaction, which appears to have endorsed, sustained and enjoyed his comments. We would hope that the Irish public will choose to stay away from such racist ‘entertainment’ in future”.<ref name="it-archbishop-and-heti-criticise-tiernan"/> The Trust also said it "utterly condemns Mr Tiernans anti-Semitic outburst and calls upon him to repudiate completely and apologise unreservedly for the comments about the Holocaust and the Jews he is reported to have made" and "This incident highlights the necessity and relevance of the role of Holocaust education in order to educate and inform people in Ireland about the Holocaust, intolerance and anti-Semitism."<ref name="it-archbishop-and-heti-criticise-tiernan"/>

Louis Lentin said Tiernan should be denied a visa for his shows in the U.S. in October.<ref name="tribune-lentin">[http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/sep/27/tiernan-should-be-denied-us-visa-says-filmmaker/ "Tiernan should be denied US visa, says filmmaker"] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015085953/http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/sep/27/tiernan-should-be-denied-us-visa-says-filmmaker/  date=15 October 2009 }}, Ken Sweeney, Sunday Tribune, 27 September 2009, retrieved 26 January 2010</ref>
Lentin said Tiernans Electric Picnic comments were "disgraceful", and "extraordinarily racist." "He doesnt realise what he has said. He doesnt realise the seriousness of it. You cant make a joke about the Holocaust and just because you say it is a joke does not make it funny or acceptable".<ref name="tribune-lentin"/>

Bob Alper Rabbi Robert Alper, who is also a comedian, said that Tiernans statement on the subject was an attempt to weasel out of the situation.<ref name="eh-tiernan">[https://archive.is/20130217212741/http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/around-town/tiernan-says-he-is-sorry-for-jewish-jibes-1894168.html "Tiernan says hes sorry for Jewish jibes"], Geraldine Gittens, Evening Herald, 23 September 2009.</ref> Rabbi Alper also said about Tiernans claim that comedians have a duty to be irresponsible: "To me thats really stupid. I dont think that comedians should be reckless or irresponsible. Comedians should be concerned about the feelings of other human beings. Its hurtful. Comedians (in America) dont do anti-semitic things. Ive rarely heard of it. There are plenty of tasteless comedians out there but none of them pick on a group of people."<ref name="eh-tiernan"/> He also did not consider Tiernans statement to be an apology, suggesting that Tiernan should say "Im sorry".<ref name="eh-tiernan"/> Hot Press magazine editor Niall Stokes later said, "To interpret it as anti-Semitism, is wrongheaded in the extreme. The way I see it, he is satirising anti-Semitism, while making a more general point that we should all be able to laugh at ourselves."

Olaf Tyaransen wrote that neither he nor Tommy Tiernan had anticipated the subsequent response to unreserved comments made by the comedian during an afternoon interview hosted by Hot Press magazine at the Electric Picnic, an end-of-season arts and music festival.<ref name="eh-ot">[http://www.herald.ie/opinion/how-could-reporter-take-my-interview-with-tommy-out-of-context-1896871.html "How could reporter take my interview with Tommy out of context?"], Olaft Tyaransen, Evening Herald, 25 September 2009.</ref> Tyaransen said the last question asked from the floor about a dogged charge of anti-Semitism led to the comments at issue, and part of Tiernans response recounted criticism of his routine by a Jewish couple after a show in New York City.<ref name="eh-ot"/> Olaf Tyaransen claimed Tiernans subsequent ideas had been taken out of context, though he personally held the comedians monologue as very funny and said as much on Marian Finucanes RTÉ Radio 1 show on 26 September 2009.
