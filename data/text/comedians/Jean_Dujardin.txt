French film historian Tim Palmer has analyzed Dujardins career and rise to success in France, noting how his formative roles were often unredeemable buffoons, very skillful portrayals of childlike men who aggressively and unabashedly reject the responsibilities and compromises of adult life. Dujardins breakthrough roles as Brice de Nice and OSS 117 exemplified this tendency.<ref>Palmer, Tim (2011).
