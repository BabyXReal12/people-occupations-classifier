Louis Feinberg (October 5, 1902 – January 24, 1975), known professionally as Larry Fine, was an American actor, comedian, violinist and boxer, who is best known as a member of the comedy act The Three Stooges.<ref name=obit/>

==Early life==
Fine was born to a Russian Jewish family at 3rd and South Street (Philadelphia) South Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on October 5, 1902.<ref>Pennsylvania, Philadelphia City Births, 1860-1906, Familysearch.org</ref><ref>A&E Network A&E television show Biography (TV series) Biography</ref><ref>[http://southstreet.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&task=viewlink&link_id=317&Itemid=12 South Street Headhouse District]</ref> His father, Joseph Feinberg, and mother, Fanny Lieberman, owned a watch repair and jewelry shop.

In his early childhood, Fines arm was accidentally burned with hydrochloric acid acid.  His father used the acid to test jewelry for its gold content. On one occasion, the young Fine mistook the acid for a beverage and raised the bottle to his lips.  Before he could drink any, his father knocked the bottle from Fines hand, splashing Fines forearm with acid and causing extensive damage to it.

His parents later gave Fine violin lessons to help strengthen the damaged muscles in his forearm. He became so proficient on the violin that his parents wanted to send him to a European music conservatory.  However, that plan was thwarted by the outbreak of World War I. Fine later played the violin in the Stooge films.  In scenes where all three Stooges are playing fiddles, only Larry is actually playing, while the other two are mime artist miming.

To further strengthen his damaged arm, Fine took up boxing in his teens, winning one professional bout. His father, opposed to Larrys fighting in public, put an end to his brief career as a boxing boxer.{{Ref 1}}

==Acting career==
===Vaudeville===
At an early age, Fine started performing as a violinist in vaudeville. In March 1928, while starring as the master of ceremonies at Chicagos Uptown, Chicago Rainbo Gardens, Fine met Shemp Howard and Ted Healy.  At the time, Healy and Howard were performing in the The Shubert Organization Shubert Brothers A Night in Spain. Since Howard was leaving the play for a few months, they asked him to be a replacement stooge.  Fine joined Teds other stooges, Bobby Pinkus and Sam Moody Braun.  Howard returned in September 1928 to finish Spains national tour.

In early 1929, Healy signed a contract to perform in the Shuberts new revue A Night in Venice.  Healy brought Fine, Shemp Howard, and Moe Howard together for the first time as a trio.  "Moe, Larry, and Shemp", with Fred Sanborn, appeared in Venice from 1929 through March 1930.  Fine, Shemp Howard and Moe Howard toured as "Ted Healy & His Racketeers" that spring and summer, and then went to Hollywood in the summer to film 20th Century Fox Fox Studios Soup to Nuts (1930).

Fine and the Howard brothers broke up with Healy after Soup to Nuts and toured as "Howard, Fine, and Howard: Three Lost Soles" from the fall of 1930 to the summer of 1932.  In July 1932, Fine and Moe Howard teamed up with Healy again, adding Curly Howard to the group. The new lineup premiered at Clevelands RKO Palace Theatre on August 27, 1932. Shemp Howard split off to pursue a solo career, appearing in Shemp Howard shorts as well as playing numerous supporting roles in feature films starring major comedians such as Roscoe Arbuckle, W.C. Fields, and Abbott and Costello, as well as other mainstream performers.

===Larrys hair===
Fine was easily recognized in the Stooge features by his hairdo, bald on top with lots of thick, bushy, curly red hair around the sides and back; Moe called him "Porcupine".  Fines trademark bushy hair had its origin, according to rumor, from his first meeting with Healy. Fine had just wet his hair in a sink basin, and it dried oddly as they talked. Healy encouraged Fine to keep the zany hairstyle.  On a 1973 TV interview on The Mike Douglas Show, Moe Howard recounted:
{{bquote "So Healy said Would you like to be one of the stooges and make three instead of two? And Larry said Yes, I would love that. Healy said, Ill give you ninety bucks a week. Fine. He also said, Ill give you an extra ten dollars a week if you throw that fiddle away."}}  This is presumed to be a fictionalized account, as Moe Howard wasnt present for that moment in March 1928, having "retired" from show business in July 1925 to go into real estate with his mother. He did not return to performing and Teds act until December 1928.  Fines backstage visitors that day were Ted Healy, Shemp Howard, and Bobby Pinkus.

===Three Stooges features===
Beginning in 1932, the Three Stooges made 206 short films and several features, their most prolific period starring Fine, Moe Howard and Curly Howard. However, their career with Healy was marked by disputes over pay, film contracts, and Healys drinking and verbal abuse. Fine and the Howard brothers finally left Healy for good in 1934.<ref name=Scrapbookrev>{{cite book  last = Maurer  first = Joan Howard  authorlink = Joan Howard Maurer author2=Jeff Lenburg  author3=Greg Lenburg   title = The Three Stooges Scrapbook  publisher = Citadel Press  origyear = 1982  year=2012 edition=revised  location =   pages =   doi =  id =   isbn = 978-1-61374-074-3   url =http://a.co/cYoBoxO}}</ref>

In films from the Curly era, the Larry character did more reacting than acting, staying in the background and serving as the voice of reason in contrast to the zany antics of Moe and Curly. He was a surrealistic foil and the middle ground between Moes gruffly "bossy", and Curlys childish personae. Like the other Stooges, Larry was often on the receiving end of Moes abuse. His reasonableness was the perfect foil to Moes brusque bluntness and Curly or Shemps boyish immaturity, but Larry would sometimes propose something impossible or illogical and be quickly put down by Moe, both verbally and physically, who would often react by pulling a handful of hair out of Larrys head.<ref name=Scrapbookrev/> Film critic Leonard Maltin commented in 1978 that "Larry is the least distinctive character of the trio, but he adds a pleasing touch by siding with either Moe or Curly, depending on the situation, thereby enabling him to show moments of lucidity as well as lunacy."<ref>{{cite book   last = Maltin   first = Leonard   authorlink = Leonard Maltin   author2=   author3=   title = The Great Movie Comedians: From Charlie Chaplin to Woody Allen   publisher = CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform   origyear = 1978  year=2015   edition=revised   location =   pages =   doi =   id =   isbn = 978-1-51432-494-3   url = http://amzn.com/1613740743}}</ref>

After Curly suffered a debilitating stroke in May 1946, Shemp replaced him in the act. The Shemp era marked a period of increased onscreen presence for Larry, who had been relegated to a background role during the Curly era. Upon Shemps return, he was allotted equal onscreen time, even becoming the focus of several films, in particular Fuelin Around (1949) and He Cooked His Goose (1952).<ref name="Okuda">{{cite book  last = Okuda  first = Ted   authorlink = Ted Okuda author2=Watz, Edward   title = The Columbia Comedy Shorts  publisher = McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers  year = 1986  location =   pages =60–102  id =   isbn = 0-89950-181-8}}</ref>

On November 22, 1955, Shemp died of a heart attack. Joe Palma played a Fake Shemp fake Shemp role in three previously contracted Stooges shorts, then Joe Besser succeeded him as the third Stooge. Joe DeRita replaced Besser in 1958 when the team was fired from Columbia Pictures.

In the earliest Stooge films, the Larry character frequently indulged in utterly nutty behavior. Fine would liven up a scene with a random improvised remark or ridiculous action. In the hospital spoof Men in Black (1934 film) Men in Black (1934), Larry, dressed as a surgeon and wielding a large kitchen knife, chortles: "Lets pluck him... and see if hes ripe!" In Disorder in the Court (1936), a tense courtroom scene is interrupted by Larry breaking into a wild Tarzan yell. Of course, after each of his outbursts, Moe would gruffly put him down. According to Fines brother, Fine developed a callus on one side of his face from being slapped innumerable times by Moe.<ref name=Scrapbookrev/>

The Larry characters on-screen goofiness has been described as an extension of Fines own relaxed personality. Director Charles Lamont recalled: "Larry was a nut. He was the kind of guy who always said anything. He was a yapper."<ref name=Scrapbookrev/> Writer-director Edward Bernds remembered that Fines suggestions for the scripts were often "flaky", but occasionally contained a good comic idea.<ref name=Scrapbookrev/>

The Three Stooges became a big hit on television in 1959, when Columbia Pictures released a batch of the trios films, whose popularity brought them to a new audience and revitalized their careers.<ref name=Scrapbookrev/>

==Personal life==

Offstage, Larry was a social butterfly. He liked a good time and surrounded himself with friends. He and his wife, Mabel Haney, loved to party, and every Christmas served lavish midnight meals. Some of his friends called him a "yes man" since he was always so agreeable, no matter what the circumstances.<ref name=Scrapbookrev/>

Larrys devil-may-care personality carried over to the world of finance. He was a terrible businessman and spent his money as soon as he earned it. He had a significant gambling addiction, leading him to gamble away all the money he had on him either at racetracks or high-stakes gin rummy card games. In an interview, Fine even admitted that he often gave money to actors and friends who needed help and never asked to be repaid. As Joe Besser and director Edward Bernds recall, because of his constant and free spending and gambling, Larry was almost forced into bankruptcy when Columbia stopped filming new Three Stooges films in December 1957.<ref name=Scrapbookrev/>

Because of his profligate ways and Mabels dislike for housekeeping, Larry and his family lived in hotels—first in the President Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where his daughter Phyllis was raised, then the Knickerbocker Hotel (Los Angeles) Knickerbocker Hotel in Hollywood. He did not own a house until the late 1940s, when he purchased one in the Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California Los Feliz area of Los Angeles, California.<ref name = "Stooge Bio"/>

On May 30, 1967, Mabel died of a sudden heart attack at age 63.<ref name="Stooge Bio">{{cite web url=http://www.threestooges.com/bios/bios.php?intStoogeID=2 title=Stooge Bios - Larry Fine publisher=threestooges.com deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729073719/http://www.threestooges.com/bios/bios.php?intStoogeID=2 archivedate=July 29, 2012 df=mdy-all}}</ref> Larry was on the road and about to take the stage for a live show at Rocky Point Amusement Park in Warwick, Rhode Island when he heard the news.<ref>You Must Be This Tall: The Story of Rocky Point Park. Midway Pictures.</ref> He immediately flew home to California, leaving the other two Stooges to improvise their remaining shows at the park.<ref name=Scrapbookrev/>

Mabels death came nearly six years after the death of their only son, John, in a car crash on November 17, 1961, at age 24.<ref name = "Stooge Bio"/> Their only daughter, Phyllis, died of cancer on April 3, 1989, at 60.<ref name=Scrapbookrev/>

Fine is sometimes erroneously reported to be the father of sportscaster Warner Wolf, who is in fact the son of Jack Wolf, one of several other "stooges" who played in Ted Healys vaudeville act at one time or another. Fine is the father-in-law of actor and Los Angeles television personality Don Lamond, best known for hosting the Stooges shorts on KTTV for many years.

==Final acting years and death==

In 1965, Fine, Moe Howard, and Joe DeRita started a new TV comedy show entitled The New 3 Stooges, a mixture of live and animated segments. While the show produced good ratings, the men were too old by this point to do slapstick comedy well.  Fine began showing signs of mental impairment, such as frequent trouble delivering his lines properly.

A few years later, the men started working Kooks Tour, a new TV series. On January 9, 1970, Fine suffered a debilitating stroke that paralyzed the left side of his body. This event marked the end of his performing career.<ref name=StrokeOfLuck/>

Fine eventually moved to the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital Motion Picture Country House, an industry retirement community in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California Woodland Hills, where he spent his remaining years, and used a wheelchair during the last five.<ref name=obit>{{cite news  author=Louis Calta   title=Larry Fine of Three Stooges, Frizzy‐Haired Comic, Is Dead  url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/25/archives/larry-fine-of-three-stooges-frizzyhaired-comic-is-dead.html  quote=  newspaper=New York Times  date=January 25, 1975 }}</ref><ref name=Scrapbookrev/><ref name=StrokeOfLuck/> Even in his paralyzed state, Fine did what he could to entertain the other patients.
