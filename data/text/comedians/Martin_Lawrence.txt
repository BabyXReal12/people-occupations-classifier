==Career==
Lawrence ended up moving to New York City and found his way to the legendary The Improv. Shortly after appearing at The Improv, Lawrence won a performance spot on Star Search.<ref name="actors"/> He did well on the show and made it to the final round, but did not win. However, executives at Columbia Pictures Television saw Martins performance and offered him the role of Maurice Warfield in Whats Happening Now!!; this was his first acting job.<ref name="actors"/> Upon cancellation of that show, Lawrence found bit parts in various films and television series. His breakthrough role was as Cee in Do the Right Thing. Other roles followed in films such as the House Party (film) House Party series, Talkin Dirty After Dark, and the Eddie Murphy vehicle Boomerang (1992 film) Boomerang.  During this period, entertainment mogul Russell Simmons selected him to host the groundbreaking series Def Comedy Jam on HBO. Def Comedy Jam gave many comedians (including Chris Tucker, Dave Chappelle, Mike Epps, Bernie Mac and Cedric the Entertainer) mainstream exposure.

During his stint with Def Comedy Jam, Lawrence appeared in his own hit series, Martin (television) Martin, which aired on Fox Broadcasting Company Fox.<ref name="actors"/> The show ran from 1992 to 1997 and was an enormous success. Martin was the flagship of Foxs Thursday-night line-up, which drew millions of viewers away from NBCs "Must See TV" line-up. He hosted Saturday Night Live on February 19, 1994, where he made crude remarks about womens genitalia and personal hygiene; the monologue was completely edited out of NBC reruns and Television syndication syndicated versions, and Lawrence was banned from the show for life. Martins ratings continued to skyrocket so much that Fox became more of a contender against NBC and came closer to being considered among the top television networks.

After Martin ended its run in 1997, Lawrence found work in comedy films. He often starred as the second lead opposite actors including Eddie Murphy, Danny DeVito, and Tim Robbins.<ref name="actors"/> Many of his films were blockbusters at the box office, including Nothing to Lose (1997 film) Nothing to Lose, Life (1999 film) Life, Blue Streak (film) Blue Streak, and Big Mommas House. He also starred in critical- and box-office failures, including Black Knight (film) Black Knight and National Security (film) National Security. Regardless, his salary steadily increased to over $10 million per film role. He continues to work in film, with such films as Big Mommas House 2, which opened at No. 1 at North American box office and grossed almost $28 million its first weekend,<ref>{{cite web   title=Yahoo!

Macy.

In 2006, Lawrence appeared on Inside the Actors Studio, during which Lawrence briefly brought back to life some of the characters he had portrayed on Martin.

In 2008, Lawrence starred in Disneys College Road Trip co-starring with Raven-Symoné. It was his first G-rated film, but not his first appearance in a childrens film: he supplied a voice for Open Season (2006 film) Open Season (2006) opposite Ashton Kutcher.

At the 2009 BET Awards he appeared in a spoof movie trailer with Jamie Foxx for a fictional movie, The Skank Robbers, that featured their respective television characters Sheneneh Jenkins and Ugly Wanda. In 2010, Fox announced that it was producing a film based on the sketch, featuring Foxx, Lawrence, and actress Halle Berry.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.thegrio.com/entertainment/skank-robbers-jamie-foxx-martin-lawrence-reprise-drag-roles.php publisher=Catch title=Skank Robbers: Jamie Foxx, Martin Lawrence to reprise drag roles date=October 11, 2010 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013191928/http://www.thegrio.com/entertainment/skank-robbers-jamie-foxx-martin-lawrence-reprise-drag-roles.php archivedate=October 13, 2010 df=mdy-all}}</ref>
