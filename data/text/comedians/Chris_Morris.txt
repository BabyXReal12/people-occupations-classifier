Christopher J Morris (born 15 June 1962) is an English comedian, writer, director, actor, voice actor, and producer. He is known for his black humour, surrealism, and controversial subject matter, and has been hailed for his "uncompromising, moralistic drive" by the British Film Institute.
In the early 1990s, Morris teamed up with his radio producer, Armando Iannucci, to create On the Hour, a satire of news programmes. This was expanded into a television spin off, The Day Today, which launched the career of Steve Coogan, and has since been hailed as one of the most important satirical shows of the 1990s.
Morris further developed the satirical news format with Brass Eye, which lampooned celebrities whilst focusing on themes such as crime and drugs. For many, the apotheosis of Morris career was a Brass Eye special, which dealt with the moral panic surrounding paedophilia. It quickly became one of the most complained about programmes in British television history, leading the Daily Mail to describe him as "the most loathed man on TV".
Meanwhile, Morris postmodern sketch and ambient music radio show Blue Jam helped him to gain a cult following. He went on to win a BAFTA for Best Short Film after expanding a Blue Jam sketch into My Wrongs 8245–8249 &amp; 117, which starred Paddy Considine. Blue Jam was adapted into the TV series Jam (TV series) Jam. This was followed by Nathan Barley, a sitcom written in collaboration with a then little-known Charlie Brooker that satirised hipster (contemporary subculture) hipsters, which had low ratings but found success upon its DVD release. Morris followed this by joining the cast of the Graham Linehan sitcom The IT Crowd, his first project in which he did not have writing or producing input.

In 2010, Morris directed his first feature-length film, Four Lions, which satirised Islamic terrorism through a group of inept British Pakistanis. Reception of the film was largely positive, earning Morris his second BAFTA, for "Outstanding Debut". Since 2012, he has directed four episodes of Iannuccis political comedy Veep (TV series) Veep and appeared onscreen in The Double (2013 film) The Double and Stewart Lees Comedy Vehicle.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Morris was born in Colchester, Essex,
to father Paul Michael Morris, a general practitioner GP,
and mother Rosemary Parrington
and grew up in a Victorian era Victorian farmhouse in the village Buckden, Cambridgeshire Buckden, Huntingdonshire, which he describes as "very dull".
He has two younger brothers, including theatre director Tom Morris (director) Tom Morris.
From an early age he was a prankster, and also had a passion for radio. From the age of 10 he was educated at Stonyhurst College, an independent Society of Jesus Jesuit boarding school in Lancashire.
He went to study zoology at the University of Bristol, where he gained a 2:1.
===Radio career===
On graduating, Morris pursued a career as a musician in various bands, for which he played the bass guitar. He then went to work for Radio West, a local radio station in Bristol. He then took up a news traineeship with BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, where he took advantage of access to editing and recording equipment to create elaborate Parody spoofs and parody parodies.
He also spent time in early 1987 hosting a 2–4pm afternoon show and finally ended up presenting Saturday morning show I.T.

In July 1987, he moved on to BBC Radio Bristol to present his own show No Known Cure, broadcast on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The show was surreal and satirical, with odd interviews conducted with unsuspecting members of the public. He was fired from Bristol in 1990 after "talking over the news bulletins and making silly noises".
In 1988 he also joined, from its launch, BBC London 94.9 Greater London Radio (GLR). He presented The Chris Morris Show on GLR until 1993, when one show got suspended after a sketch was broadcast involving a child "outing" celebrities.
In 1991, Morris joined Armando Iannuccis spoof news project On the Hour. Broadcast on BBC Radio 4, it saw him work alongside Iannucci, Steve Coogan, Stewart Lee, Richard Herring and Rebecca Front. In 1992, Morris hosted Danny Bakers Radio 5 Morning Edition show for a week whilst Baker was on holiday. In 1994, Morris began a weekly evening show, the Chris Morris Music Show, on BBC Radio 1 alongside Peter Baynham and man with a mobile phone Paul Garner (comedian) Paul Garner. In the shows, Morris perfected the spoof interview style that would become a central component of his Brass Eye programme. In the same year, Morris teamed up with Peter Cook (as Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling), in a series of improvised conversations for BBC Radio 3 entitled Why Bother? (radio show) Why Bother?.

In 1994, a BBC Two BBC 2 television series based on On the Hour was broadcast under the name The Day Today. The Day Today made a star of Morris, and marked the television debut of Steve Coogans Alan Partridge character. The programme ended on a high after just one series, with Morris winning the 1994 British Comedy Award for Best Newcomer for his lead role as the Jeremy Paxman Paxmanesque news anchor.
In 1996, Morris appeared on the daytime programme The Time, The Place, posing as an academic, Thurston Lowe, in a discussion entitled "Are British Men Lousy Lovers?", but was found out when a producer alerted the shows host, John Stapleton.
In 1997, the black comedy black humour which had featured in On the Hour and The Day Today became more prominent in Brass Eye, another spoof current affairs television documentary, shown on Channel 4. Brass Eye became known for tricking celebrities and politicians into throwing support behind public awareness campaigns for made-up issues that were often absurd or surreal (such as a drug called cake and an elephant with its trunk stuck up its anus).

From 1997 to 1999 Morris created Blue Jam for BBC Radio 1, a surreal taboo-breaking radio show set to an ambient soundtrack.
In 2000 this was followed by Jam (TV series) Jam, a television reworking.
Morris released a remix version of this, entitled Jaaaaam.
In 2001, a special episode of Brass Eye on the moral panic that surrounds pedophilia paedophilia attracted a record-breaking number of complaints – the total remains the third highest on UK television after Celebrity Big Brother 2007 (UK) Celebrity Big Brother 2007 and Jerry Springer: The Opera – as well as heated discussion in the press. Many complainants, some of whom later admitted to not having seen the programme (notably Beverley Hughes, a government minister),
felt the satire was directed at the victims of paedophilia, which Morris denies. Channel 4 defended the show, insisting the target was the media and its hysterical treatment of paedophilia, and not victims of crime.

In 2002, Morris ventured into film, directing the short film short My Wrongs 8245–8249 &amp; 117 My Wrongs#8245–8249 &amp; 117, adapted from a Blue Jam monologue about a man led astray by a sinister talking dog. It was the first film project of Warp Films, a branch of Warp Records. In 2002 this won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts BAFTA for best short film.
In 2005 Morris worked on a sitcom entitled Nathan Barley, based on the character created by Charlie Brooker for his website TVGoHome (Morris had contributed to TVGoHome on occasion, under the pseudonym Sid Peach
). Co-written by Brooker and Morris, the series was broadcast on Channel 4 in early 2005.

===Post 2005: The IT Crowd, Comedy Vehicle, and Four Lions===
Morris was a cast member in The IT Crowd, a Channel 4 sitcom which focused on the information technology department of the fictional company Reynholm Industries. The series was written and directed by Graham Linehan (writer of Father Ted and Black Books, with whom Morris collaborated on The Day Today, Brass Eye and Jam) and produced by Ash Atalla (The Office (UK TV series) The Office). Morris played Denholm Reynholm, the eccentric managing director of the company. This marked the first time Morris has acted in a substantial role in a project which he has not developed himself. Morris character appeared to leave the series during episode two of the second series. His character made a brief return in the first episode of the third series.

In November 2007, Morris wrote an article for The Observer in response to Ronan Bennetts article published six days earlier in The Guardian. Bennetts article, "Shame on us", accused the novelist Martin Amis of racism. Morris response, "The absurd world of Martin Amis", was also highly critical of Amis; although he did not accede to Bennetts accusation of racism, Morris likened Amis to the Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri Abu Hamza (who was jailed for inciting racial hatred in 2006), suggesting that both men employ "mock erudition, vitriol and decontextualised quotes from the Quran" to incite hatred.
Morris served as script editor for the 2009 series Stewart Lees Comedy Vehicle, working with former colleagues Stewart Lee, Kevin Eldon and Armando Iannucci. He maintained this role for the second (2011) and third series (2014).

Morris completed his debut feature film Four Lions in late 2009, a satire based on a group of Islamist terrorists in Sheffield.
It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2010 and was short-listed for the festivals World Cinema Narrative prize.
The film (working title Boilerhouse) was picked up by Film Four.
Morris told The Sunday Times that the film sought to do for Islamic terrorism what Dads Army, the classic BBC comedy, did for the National Socialists by showing them as "scary but also ridiculous".
In 2012, Morris directed the seventh and penultimate episode of the first season of Veep (TV series) Veep, an Armando Iannucci-devised American version of The Thick of It.
In 2013, he returned to direct two episodes for the second season of Veep, and a further episode for season three in 2014.

In 2013, Morris appeared briefly in Richard Ayoades The Double (2013 film) The Double, a black comedy film based on the Fyodor Dostoyevsky The Double (Fyodor Dostoyevsky novel) novella of the same name. Morris had previously worked with Ayoade on Nathan Barley and The IT Crowd.

In February 2014, Morris made a surprise appearance at the beginning of a Stewart Lee live show, introducing the comedian with fictional anecdotes about their work together.
The following month, Morris appeared in the third series of Stewart Lees Comedy Vehicle as a "hostile interrogator",
a role previously occupied by Armando Iannucci.

In December 2014, it was announced that a short radio collaboration with Noel Fielding and Richard Ayoade would be broadcast on BBC Radio 6.
According to an interview with Fielding in 2011, the work had already been in progress for five years by that point.
However, it was decided, in consultation with [Morris], that the project was not yet complete, and so the intended broadcast did not go ahead.
A statement released by Film4 in February 2016 made reference to funding what will be Morris second feature-film.
In November 2017 it was reported that Morris had shot the movie, starring Anna Kendrick, in the Dominican Republic
but the title was not made public.

==Music==
Morris often co-writes and performs incidental music for his television shows, notably with Jam and the extended remix version, Jaaaaam. In the early 1990s Morris contributed a Pixies parody track entitled "Motherbanger" to a Flexi disc flexi-disc given away with an edition of select magazine Select music magazine.
Morris supplied sketches for British band Saint Etienne (band) Saint Etiennes 1993 single "Youre in a Bad Way" (the sketch Spongbake appears at the end of the 4th track on the CD single).
In 2000, he collaborated by mail with Amon Tobin to create the track "Bad Sex", which was released as a B-side on the Tobin single "Slowly".
British band Stereolabs song "Nothing to Do with Me" from their 2001 album Sound-Dust featured various lines from Chris Morris sketches as lyrics.
==Recognition==
In 2003, Morris was listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy.
In 2005, Channel 4 aired a show called The Comedians Comedian in which foremost writers and performers of comedy ranked their 50 favourite acts. Morris was at number eleven.
Morris won the BAFTA for outstanding debut with his film Four Lions. Adeel Akhtar and Nigel Lindsay collected the award in his absence.
Lindsay stated that Morris had sent him a text message before they collected the award reading, Doused in petrol, Zippo at the ready.
In June 2012 Morris was placed at number 16 in the Top 100 People in UK Comedy.
In 2010, a biography, Disgusting Bliss: The Brass Eye of Chris Morris, was published. Written by Lucian Randall, the book depicted Morris as "brilliant but uncompromising", and a "frantic-minded perfectionist".
In November 2014, a three-hour retrospective of Morris radio career was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra under the title Raw Meat Radio, presented by Mary Anne Hobbs and featuring interviews with Armando Iannucci, Peter Baynham, Paul Garner (comedian) Paul Garner, and others.
