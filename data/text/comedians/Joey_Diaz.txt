In 1982, Diaz moved to Colorado. However, his growing homesickness led to his return to New Jersey initially for his birthday in 1984, but he stayed there for eighteen months.

==Career==
===Stand-up comedy===
In June 1985, Diaz left New Jersey for good and returned to Colorado to study economics at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He did not enjoy his time there, and quit before taking up work selling roofing which earned him money, but he remained unhappy.<ref name=HudReporter4.21.03/> Developments in his life were interrupted by a stint in prison in 1988, following his arrest for kidnapping and aggravated robbery.<ref name=HudReporter10.2.11>{{Cite news url=http://hudsonreporter.com/view/full_story/15853263/article-From-North-Bergen-to-prison-to-Hollywood-Documentary-will-standup-comedian%E2%80%99s-humble-roots- title=From North Bergen to prison to Hollywood last=LaMarca first=Stephen date=October 2, 2011 work=The Hudson Reporter accessdate=January 28, 2017}}</ref> During his time in prison, Diaz would perform stand-up routines for his fellow inmates during the weekly film screening event when the projector broke. It took Diaz a further three years to try stand-up, despite being often told of his talent, and later called his entry into the line of work as "the last resort" as he had many other jobs in the past.<ref name=CantonRepository/> After seeing the 1988 film  Punchline (film) Punchline, Diaz responded to an advertisement for a $37 stand-up comedy course in the Rocky Mountain Post, and developed a blue comedy act. Before he did his first standup routine, he worked as a doorman at Wits End.<ref name=HowComedyWorks>{{cite web url=http://comedyworks.libsyn.com/episode-30-joey-diaz title=How Comedy Works with Wende Curtis and Rick Kerns - Episode 30: Joey Diaz date=September 2, 2016 publisher=Libsyn accessdate=April 2, 2017}}</ref>

Diaz performed his first routine on June 18, 1991<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By-zQN2g0DE title=Joe Rogan Experience #598 - Joey "CoCo" Diaz at=1:54:00 date=January 12, 2015 accessdate=April 3, 2017 via=YouTube}}</ref> at the Comedy Works in Denver at a show headlined by Matt Woods. In April 1992, prior to his opening spot for Troy Baxley in Boulder, Colorado, Diaz took cocaine before going on stage and had a set that he described as "a disaster". He then ceased to take the substance before a performance. After developing his act, Diaz entered the Becks Amateur Comedy Competition and won. He initially lost another competition until the winner was caught joke thievery stealing jokes made famous by Jerry Seinfeld and Diaz was declared the winner. Diaz claimed Comedy Works manager Wende Curtis promised him a flight to Los Angeles for a showcase spot at The Comedy Store for owner Mitzi Shore, but never received either.<ref name=HowComedyWorks/> Diaz went on to participate in a similar contest in Seattle, Washington (state) Washington, and finished sixth out of 40.<ref name=HudReporter4.21.03/> In 1994, Diaz returned to the Comedy Works and found Curtis had started a developmental program for comics which he joined. The process involved group writing sessions at Woods home followed by sets in the club the same evening. At one point, Curtis banned Diaz from the Comedy Works before it was lifted after they met years later.<ref name=HowComedyWorks/>

In 1995, Diaz left Colorado for Los Angeles, California to try and make it as a successful stand-up comic. Had he failed, and after an incident with his ex-wifes boyfriend which almost landed him in prison (by a miracle, nothing came of the incident), in which he slapped him for calling Joey racial slurs in front of Joeys daughter, he was set on returning to Colorado and send jokes to Jay Leno via fax machine from prison.<ref name=HowComedyWorks/> He used his divorce from his first wife, and the loss of contact with their daughter in the process, as a motivation so he "could come back and make her proud".<ref name=CantonRepository/> In the following years, he worked on his act in local and national venues as a supporting act for other comedians. Around 1997, Diaz first met his longtime friend Joe Rogan, who had Diaz open for him on his stand-up tours.{{citation needed date=April 2018}}

===Film and television===
In 1998, Diaz received a contract to star in a television pilot, playing a bartender in a series titled Bronx County, after a talent scout at CBS saw him perform comedy in Seattle. The offer was a total surprise to Diaz, who initially did not believe him until he saw the talent scout possess tickets to have him fly to Los Angeles for the shoot. The series was not picked up, but the opportunity led to more work for Diaz, including an offer in his first feature film, a referee in BASEketball (1998), and a part in the television series NYPD Blue. In 2000, Diaz was featured in You Got Nothin (2003), an independent film. Parts of Analyze That (2002), which starred Diaz, were filmed in Hudson County, New Jersey. He said, "That was big for me, able to come home to film".<ref name=CantonRepository/>

Diaz proceeded to assemble an audition tape: "I went out and got a football jersey two sizes too small, pants two sizes two small with my butt hanging out. I got kids football shoulder pads and ran around the field with a cigar in my mouth". Three days after submitting the tape, Diaz landed the role; the producers liked the name Big Tony Tedesco, which Diaz named himself on the tape, and wrote it into the script.<ref name=hudson-20040911>{{cite web url=http://hudsonreporter.com/view/full_story/2400244/article-NB-comedian-gets-big-break-in--Longest-Yard--Diaz-in-remake-of-classic-football-prison-movie-with-Burt-Reynolds?instance=search_results title=NB comedian gets big break in Longest Yard Diaz in remake of classic football prison movie with Burt Reynolds work=The Hudson Reporter first=Jim last=Hague date=September 11, 2004 accessdate=March 31, 2017}}</ref> Originally Diaz had a mere three lines, but his tape got his part extended.<ref name=hudson-20050607>{{cite web url=http://hudsonreporter.com/view/full_story/2405004/article-Tackling-the--Longest-Yard--North-Bergen-native-Diaz-enjoys-prominent-role-in-remake-starring-Sandler--Rock--Reynolds?instance=search_results title=Tackling the Longest Yard North Bergen native Diaz enjoys prominent role in remake starring Sandler, Rock, Reynolds work=The Hudson Reporter first=Jim last=Hague date=June 7, 2005 accessdate=March 31, 2017}}</ref>
