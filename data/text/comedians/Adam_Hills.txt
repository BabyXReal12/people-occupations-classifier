==Career==

===Stand-up career===

Hills first appearance in comedy scene was in 1989 at the Sydney Comedy Store. He did breakfast radio on SAFM in Adelaide besides stand-up gigs, and by the mid-1990s he decided to focus on live comedy. In 1997 he premiered "Stand Up and Deliver", the first of 10 solo shows, all of which have toured internationally. He has travelled widely, performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and the Montreal Just For Laughs festival.
He has been nominated for three consecutive Edinburgh Comedy Awards for his 2001, 2002 and 2003 solo shows at the Edinburgh Fringe.
The title of his 2001 show, "Go You Big Red Fire Engine", was coined during a 1999 performance in Melbourne. Hills asked an audience member to yell his name to the audience and for the audience to yell it back, but instead the man yelled "Go you big red fire engine!"
The phrase quickly became an audience chant, and Hills promised he would make it the name of his next show because, he says, "it was such an uplifting and genuinely silly moment."
"Go You Big Red Fire Engine" later became the name of a second stand-up show and a comedy album; it also appeared in a Detroit newspaper, on a Swedish website and was yelled by Senator Natasha Stott Despoja in the Parliament of Australia Australian Parliament.
His artificial right foot is commonly used as a source of humour in his shows and the comedian has been known to remove it and pass it around. However, Hills had been performing live comedy for over a decade before he made reference to his prosthesis on stage, and it was only after "Go You Big Red Fire Engine" was nominated for a Perrier Award in 2001 that he began incorporating it into his act. Hills says he felt he could too easily have become a novelty act and that he "didnt want to be known as the one-legged comedian ... I wanted to prove myself as a comic before talking about this."
Hills regularly performs alongside Leanne Beer, an AUSLAN sign interpreter at his festival shows, a move sparked by a performance he did in Adelaide at a disability art conference.
An interpreter had been provided at the show, and Hills found that it not only allowed the deaf audience members to enjoy his material but was also an entertaining and fascinating experience for the hearing audience members. "Now I have hearing people who will only book [for sign interpreted shows]", he says.
His influences are Chris Addison, Greg Fleet, Rich Hall, Daniel Kitson, Ross Noble and David ODoherty
===Television career===
Hills hosted the music trivia show Spicks and Specks from its premiere in 2005. In late 2007, he joined the show on a national live tour dubbed the "Spicks and Speck-tacular", with appearances in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Newcastle and Perth.
In late 2011 and early 2012, the show hit the road again for Spicks and Speck-tacular – The Finale, appearing in Sydney, Newcastle, Brisbane, Gold Coast, Wollongong, Canberra, Adelaide, Perth and Melbourne. He has also made appearances on Australian shows Rove (TV series) Rove Live, The Glass House (2001 TV series) The Glass House and The Fat, as well as the British Never Mind the Buzzcocks, Mock the Week QI and Ask Rhod Gilbert.
Additionally he appeared on the first TV edition of BBC Northern Irelands Great Unanswered Questions.

In 2012, he was part of the UK Channel 4 TV commentary team for the London 2012 Summer Paralympics,
and hosted a daily alternative review of each days events, The Last Leg, with Alex Brooker and comedian Josh Widdicombe.

beginning on 25 January 2013. The 150th edition is due to air on 23 February 2018. Hills hosted the panel game Monumental for BBC Northern Ireland in 2013.

In August 2013, it was announced that Hills would present a special one-off revival episode of Channel 4s quiz show, Fifteen to One.
This was aired on 20 September 2013, as part of the channels 1980s-themed Back to the Future weekend of programmes.
He was credited under the name "Adam C. Hills" in a tribute to the original presenter, William G. Stewart. In 2014, Hills will return to present four more celebrity specials; a full daytime series will be hosted by Sandi Toksvig.
In August 2013, Hills set viewers of The Last Leg a challenge to see if they could get away with editing his Wikipedia page and filling it with misinformation. This led to some short-lived vandalisation of his page as well as vandalism on the pages of his co-hosts Alex Brooker and Josh Widdicombe, and also several guests who appeared in later shows of that run – most notably that of Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London.{{citation needed date=December 2013}}
