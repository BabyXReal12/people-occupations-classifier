==Career==

===Stand-up career===

Hills first appearance in comedy scene was in 1989 at the Sydney Comedy Store. He did breakfast radio on SAFM in Adelaide besides stand-up gigs, and by the mid-1990s he decided to focus on live comedy. In 1997 he premiered "Stand Up and Deliver", the first of 10 solo shows, all of which have toured internationally. He has travelled widely, performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and the Montreal Just For Laughs festival.<ref>{{cite web  author=Elliott, Tim   url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/adam-hills-loves-bringing-people-together/2008/06/27/1214472741818.html   title=Mr Nice Guy  work=The Sydney Morning Herald date=28 June 2008 accessdate=19 August 2008}}</ref> He has been nominated for three consecutive Edinburgh Comedy Awards for his 2001, 2002 and 2003 solo shows at the Edinburgh Fringe.<ref>{{cite web  author=Staff writer url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/a/452/adam_hills title=Adam Hills work=Chortle accessdate=19 August 2008  archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080829150440/http://chortle.co.uk/comics/a/452/adam_hills  archivedate= 29 August 2008   deadurl= no}}</ref>

The title of his 2001 show, "Go You Big Red Fire Engine", was coined during a 1999 performance in Melbourne. Hills asked an audience member to yell his name to the audience and for the audience to yell it back, but instead the man yelled "Go you big red fire engine!"<ref name="hill be back">{{cite web  author=Burgess, Marissa   url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/comedy/s/133/133570_hill_be_back.html   title=Hill Be Back  work=Manchester Evening News date=14 October 2004 accessdate=19 August 2008}} {{Dead link date=October 2010 bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The phrase quickly became an audience chant, and Hills promised he would make it the name of his next show because, he says, "it was such an uplifting and genuinely silly moment."<ref>{{cite web  author=Whittaker, Andrea  url=http://www.reachout.com.au/default.asp?ti=1631  title=Adam Hills  work=Reach Out!  accessdate=19 August 2008  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726130000/http://www.reachout.com.au/default.asp?ti=1631  archivedate=26 July 2008  deadurl=yes  df=dmy }}</ref> "Go You Big Red Fire Engine" later became the name of a second stand-up show and a comedy album; it also appeared in a Detroit newspaper, on a Swedish website and was yelled by Senator Natasha Stott Despoja in the Parliament of Australia Australian Parliament.<ref name="hill be back" />

His artificial right foot is commonly used as a source of humour in his shows and the comedian has been known to remove it and pass it around. However, Hills had been performing live comedy for over a decade before he made reference to his prosthesis on stage, and it was only after "Go You Big Red Fire Engine" was nominated for a Perrier Award in 2001 that he began incorporating it into his act. Hills says he felt he could too easily have become a novelty act and that he "didnt want to be known as the one-legged comedian ... I wanted to prove myself as a comic before talking about this."<ref>{{cite web  author=Scott-Norman, Fiona   url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/04/05/1017206254254.html   title=Unspeakably Funny  work=The Age date=5 April 2006 accessdate=19 August 2008}}</ref>

Hills regularly performs alongside Leanne Beer, an AUSLAN sign interpreter at his festival shows, a move sparked by a performance he did in Adelaide at a disability art conference.<ref>{{cite web  author=Hills, Adam  url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/columnists/adam/060803_index.shtml  title=Sign Here If Youre Normal  work=Ouch!  date=6 August 2003  accessdate=19 August 2008  deadurl=yes  archivedate=7 December 2003  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031207085910/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/columnists/adam/060803_index.shtml}}</ref> An interpreter had been provided at the show, and Hills found that it not only allowed the deaf audience members to enjoy his material but was also an entertaining and fascinating experience for the hearing audience members. "Now I have hearing people who will only book [for sign interpreted shows]", he says.<ref name="Di Fonzo, Benito" />

In August 2013, Hills set viewers of The Last Leg a challenge to see if they could get away with editing his Wikipedia page and filling it with misinformation. This led to some short-lived vandalisation of his page as well as vandalism on the pages of his co-hosts Alex Brooker and Josh Widdicombe, and also several guests who appeared in later shows of that run – most notably that of Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London.{{citation needed date=December 2013}}

All proceeds went to the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council, an organisation supported by Barnes and Jon Bon Jovi that supports firefighters. Hills has performed the song several times on television, including a performance honouring Barnes guest appearance on Spicks and Specks.<ref>{{cite web  author=Staff writer   url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2003/01/22/2530/disco_inferno   title=Disco Inferno  work=Chortle  date=22 January 2003  accessdate=19 August 2008}}</ref>
