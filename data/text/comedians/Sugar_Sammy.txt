==Francophone career==
In 2007 Sugar Sammy appeared in Quebecs Le Show Raisonnable, and in 2009 performed in the French edition of the Just for Laughs Festival. His point of view concerning Quebec politics and culture from the perspective of a minority earned him a standing ovation and "The Revelation of the Year" award. In 2010 he made headlines again by presenting an award alongside Quebec political leader Pauline Marois. He teased her incessantly about sovereignty and the language debate.

Sugar Sammy wanted a stronger presence in Quebec. His bilingual show You’re Gonna Rire became his first tour of Quebec in 2012.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.myvirtualpaper.com/doc/lpa-magazine/lpa_web/2011052001/32.html#32 title=La Presse Affaires Magazine - 0032 work=Virtual Paper accessdate=February 2, 2015}}</ref>

In May 2013, Sugar Sammy became the first anglophone comedian to win at Quebecs prestigious Olivier comedy awards. He won the Olivier for Best Show (voted by the industry, for En français svp!) and the Olivier for Comedian of the Year (voted by the public).<ref>{{cite web url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/sugar-sammy-picked-as-quebec-s-comedian-of-the-year-1.1279035 title=Sugar Sammy picked as Quebecs comedian of the year work=Montreal accessdate=February 2, 2015}}</ref>  In 2014, he once again won the Olivier for Comedian of the Year at the 16th annual gala, and Apple chose him to perform in their TV ads in French Canada.

During December 2014, he ran a billboard ad in the Montreal Metro stating that "For Christmas, Id like a complaint from the Office québécois de la langue française Office de la langue française", in reference to the Quebec government organization that forces businesses to run ads in French. After a complaint was received, the English text was blacked out and replaced by "Pour Noel, jai eu une plainte de lOffice de la langue française" ("For Christmas, I got a complaint from the Office de la langue française"). This marketing campaign, designed by Sid Lee, garnered much attention from Quebec media and was the center of heated debates between different linguistic communities in the province.<ref>{{cite web url=http://bryo.ca/fr/sugar-sammy-tensions-langues-publicite-metro/ title=Lhumoriste Sugar Sammy se moque des tensions linguistiques dans une nouvelle publicité - Bryo work=Bryo accessdate=February 2, 2015}}</ref>

Montreal comedian Sugar Sammy’s bilingual show, in the four and a half years since its debut, became a hit with little precedent, the most successful solo comedy show Montreal has ever seen, and one that catapulted its creator from merely being a successful comic to becoming a bonafide star. Through his comedy, his charisma and his evident sense of gratitude at the support he received from fans and the media for an ambitious concept that, if executed even a little bit off-key, could have become a far more polarizing endeavour, it quickly become clear this was one of those rare confluences of ideal messenger, ideal message and ideal time.<ref>http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/boshra-sugar-sammy-youre-gonna-rire</ref> In July 2016, after setting records in the Province of Quebec- he is the comedian whos sold the most tickets to a debut one-man show in Quebec history, Sugar Sammy announced that, as the curtain comes down on all the You’re Gonna Rire madness, he’ll be heading to France in an effort to conquer that particular market.<ref>http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/arts_et_spectacles/2016/07/28/005-sugar-sammy-festival-juste-pour-rire-dernier-spectacle.shtml</ref>

In fall 2016, Sugar Sammy sets off for Paris and launches a new show geared specifically for a French audience. His show opened March 1, 2017 at l’Européen, in Paris. New to the French scene, Sugar Sammy quickly became one of the best selling shows in Paris.<ref name="parismatch.com">http://www.parismatch.com/Culture/Spectacles/Les-impros-delirantes-de-Sugar-Sammy-1227107</ref> Sugar Sammy received the top critic score, the 3Ts from Télérama.<ref name="telerama.fr">http://www.telerama.fr/sortir/sugar-sammy-comment-la-star-de-l-humour-quebecois-a-conquis-la-france,156672.php</ref> More shows were added in Paris until the end of December 2017.
