==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Rosenbaum was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, into a Jewish family. His parents, Bernhard and Frederikke (Lichtinger) Rosenbaum, were both musicians: his father a Viola violist in the Royal Danish Orchestra,<ref>{{cite web   url = http://www.kglteater.dk/site/OmKunstarterne/Ensembler/Det_Kongelige_Kapel/Tidslinjen.aspx   title = Det Kongelige Teater – Kort fortalt   accessdate =3 October 2010   language = Danish   quote = My father played in the orchestra for more than 30 years – we couldnt recognise him, when he came home.

He gave his first piano recital when he was eight years old, and in 1918 was awarded a full scholarship at the Royal Danish Academy of Music, studying under Olivo Krause. Later on, he was taught by Victor Schiøler, Franz Liszt Liszts student Frederic Lamond (pianist) Frederic Lamond, and Ferruccio Busoni Busonis pupil Egon Petri.

Borge played his first major concert in 1926 at the Danish Odd Fellow Palæet (The Odd Fellows Lodge building) concert hall. After a few years as a classical concert pianist, he started his now famous "stand-up comedy stand-up" act, with the signature blend of piano music and jokes. He married American Elsie Chilton in 1933, the same year he debuted with his revue acts.<ref name="Jensen1966">{{cite book

===Move to America===
Even though Borge did not speak a word of English upon arrival, he quickly managed to adapt his jokes to the American audience, learning English by watching movies. He took the name of Victor Borge, and in 1941, he started on Rudy Vallees radio show.<ref>{{cite book

===Borges style===
One of Borges other famous routines was  "Phonetic Punctuation," in which he read a passage from a book and added exaggerated sound effects to stand for all of the punctuation marks, such as periods, commas, and exclamation marks.<ref>{{cite book

 quote=Victor Borge and his dead-pan interpretations of phonetic punctuation and gags clicked soundly with the pew-sitters.}}</ref> Another is his "Inflationary Language," in which he added one to every number or homophone of a number in the words he spoke. For example: "once upon a time" becomes "twice upon a time," "wonderful" becomes "twoderful," "forehead" becomes "fivehead," "anyone for tennis" becomes "anytwo five elevennis," "I ate a tenderloin with my fork and so on and so forth" becomes "I nine an elevenderloin with my fivek and so on and so fifth."<ref name="Cullen2007" />
File:Victor Borge in concert 1957.JPG thumb left 175px Borge performing before an audience in 1957
Borge used physical and visual elements in his live and televised performances. He would play a strange-sounding piano tune from sheet music, looking increasingly confused; turning the sheet upside down or sideways, he would then play the actual tune, flashing a joyful smile of accomplishment to the audience (he had, at first, been literally playing the tune upside down or sideways). When his energetic playing of another song would cause him to fall off the piano bench, he would open the seat lid, take out the two ends of an automotive seat belt, and buckle himself onto the bench, "for safety." Conducting an orchestra, he might stop and order a violinist who had played a sour note to get off the stage, then resume the performance and have the other members of the section move up to fill the empty seat while they were still playing. From off stage would come the sound of a gunshot.

His musical sidekick in the 1960s, Leonid Hambro, was also a well-known concert pianist. In 1968, classical pianist Şahan Arzruni joined him as his straight man, performing together on one piano a version of Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 Liszts Second Hungarian Rhapsody, considered a musical-comedic classic.<ref>{{YouTube qyArTMtgT1w Victor Borge – Hungarian Rhapsody #2. December 3, 2015 - This video is unavailable. <!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>

He also enjoyed interacting with the audience. Seeing an interested person in the front row, he would ask them, "Do you like good music?" or "Do you care for piano music?" After an affirmative answer, Borge would take a piece of sheet music from his piano and say, "Here is some," and hand it over. After the audiences laughter died down, he would say, "Thatll be $1.95" (or whatever the current price might be). He would then ask whether the audience member could read music; if the member said yes, he would ask a higher price. If he got no response from the audience after a joke, he would often add "...when this ovation has died down, of course." The delayed punchline to handing the person the sheet music would come when he would reach the end of a number and begin playing the penultimate notes over and over, with a puzzled look. He would then go back to the person in the audience, retrieve the sheet music, tear off a piece of it, stick it on the piano, and play the last couple of notes from it.

Making fun of modern theater, he would sometimes begin a performance by asking if there were any children in the audience. There always were, of course. He would sternly order them out, then say, "We do have some children in here; that means I cant do the second half in the nude. Ill wear the tie. (pause) The long one. (pause) The very long one, yes."<ref>{{YouTube Lx4n9P4bLEo Victor Borge – Funny Jokes -Part 1<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>

In his stage shows in later years, he would include a segment with opera singer Marilyn Mulvey. She would try to sing an aria, and he would react and interrupt, with such antics as falling off the bench in "surprise" when she hit a high note. He would also remind her repeatedly not to rest her hand on the piano, telling her that if she got used to it, "and one day a piano was not there – Fffftttt! " After the routine, the spotlight would fall upon Mulvey and she would sing a serious number with Borge accompanying in the background.

===Later career===
Borge appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show Toast of the Town hosted by Ed Sullivan several times during 1948. He became a naturalization naturalized citizen of the United States the same year. He started the Comedy in Music  show at John Golden Theatre in New York City on 2 October 1953. Comedy in Music became the longest running one-man show in the history of theater with 849 performances when it closed on 21 January 1956, a feat which placed it in the Guinness World Records Guinness Book of World Records.<ref name="Young1998">{{cite book
