==Books==
It Books (HarperCollins) is the publisher of Lampanellis memoir, Chocolate, Please: My Adventures in Food, Fat, and Freaks (2009).  Publishers Weekly reviewed:
{{quote After more than 30 pages on her search for the "perfect black man," Lampanelli moves on to outline her standup career, from handling hecklers to doing The Tonight Show... Seeking the roots of her humor, she recalls her childhood as an "attention whore": "Eating to get attention is a behavior that I continued into my high school days." She follows her memories of "fat rehab" with a variety of topics, from the Virgin Mary to vegans. Much is quite funny, and Lampanelli never pulls her punches. Despite her raw language and raucous writing, honest reflections and stark self-insights emerge as she probes her past.<ref>Publishers Weekly, July 27, 2009.</ref>}}
