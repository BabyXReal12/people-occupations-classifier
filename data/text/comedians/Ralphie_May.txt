She was really beneficial, she kept us in a stature way above our means and made sure we were taken care of as far as clean clothes and shoes." His Facebook bio also references his grandmother. "When I was a kid, my grandmother taught me how to crochet and how to quilt, and thats kind of how I do an act. I have one-liners, I have dirty jokes, but I also have long stories that are 10 or 20 minutes long and the laughs come every eight seconds. Its a different set. And its a different life than most people have led."

In an interview with the Arkansas Times in 2012, he discussed growing up in Clarksville, shedding light on some of the hardships he faced. He shared, "It was a hard life growing up. It was a similar story to a lot of people in Arkansas. My mom was a florist. Im the youngest of four. My father and mother hated each other, and they took it out on us. Shed sue him for not paying child support, then he didnt pay, and that ended up costing us a lot..."

In 2013, May and his wife Turner started a podcast together called Perfect 10.

His memoir, This Might Get a Little Heavy, was published in December 2017.<ref>{{cite web last1=Shanley first1=Patrick title=Comedian Ralphie May to Pen Humorous Memoir url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/comedian-ralphie-may-pen-humorous-789373 website=Hollywood Reporter accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref>
