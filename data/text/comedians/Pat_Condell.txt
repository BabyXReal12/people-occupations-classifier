==Early life==
Condell was born in Republic of Ireland Ireland<ref name="Pat_Condell_20100817_video">{{cite video  people=Pat Condell  date=17 August 2010  title=An Irish joke  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmxMlSTETo  publisher=YouTube  time=1:08  quote=I was born in Ireland  accessdate=20 August 2010}}</ref> and raised in England as a Catholic Church Roman Catholic.<ref name="time-out-london">{{cite web  last=Hay  first=Malcolm  title=Pat Condell: interview  publisher=Time Out London  date=3 November 2006  url=http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/pat-condell-interview  accessdate=20 August 2010 quote=Condell’s 56. He was born an Irish Catholic but educated in Church of England schools.}}</ref>  His father was a Problem gambling compulsive gambler working in a betting shop until he was sent to prison for stealing money; he then died of leukaemia.<ref name="time-out-london" /> The Condell family in consequence was impoverished, moving repeatedly from home to home.

He was educated in several different Church of England schools in South London; saying of this time: "I found myself segregated in assembly and shunted into another room while everyone said their morning prayers. The whole pantomime seemed hollow to me even then. Once you become aware of the gulf between what people profess to believe and how they actually behave, it’s hard to take any of it seriously."<ref name="time-out-london"/>

Condell left school at 16, his first job being a dish-washer in the revolving restaurant on top of the Post Office Tower, now known as the BT Tower in London, for five shillings an hour.<ref name="patcondell9" />  He became a vegetarian in 1976 after watching a deer being butchered.<ref>{{cite web

===No Mosque at Ground Zero===
{{See also Park51}}
Condell has been resolute and outspoken in his opposition to the development of Park51, near the site of 11 September 2001 September 11, 2001 attacks World Trade Center attack, in lower Manhattan. On 4 June 2010, he released a video titled "No Mosque at Ground Zero", in which he said that it was representative of Islamic triumphalism and that the United States would soon be on the verge of Islamization and have its freedoms trimmed, as Europe has.<ref>{{cite web

  accessdate =13 February 2011}}</ref> The video has attracted 6 million views since it was uploaded. Speaking on why he believes the Mosque is offensive, Pat Condell stated:

:"To describe it as they have as a tribute to the victims is beyond bad taste, and shows a profound contempt for those who died. It would be hard to find a more provocative gesture short of standing on their graves and burning the American flag. Yet how typical of Islam, with its own hair trigger sensitivity to the slightest imagined insult, to do something so arrogant and insensitive."<ref>{{cite web

Additionally, Condell cast some doubt over the funding of the community centre, and claimed that Islam would have been banned in the civilised world if it wasnt for the fact it was a religion. He compared the system of Sharia and the Muslims who endorse it to Nazi Germany. The video was among the top 10 most discussed YouTube videos of 2010.<ref>{{cite web url=http://metro.co.uk/2010/12/21/angry-redheads-rant-is-most-discussed-youtube-video-of-2010-620678/ title=Angry redhead’s rant is most discussed YouTube video of 2010 publisher=Metro.co.uk accessdate=10 February 2018 date=21 December 2010}}</ref>

Condell also received criticism after links to his monologue titled The Trouble with Islam, were circulated to commissioners in the California city of Berkeley, California Berkeleys Peace and Justice Commission. Condell said in the video that Islam is "a religion of war", that "Muslim women in Britain who cover their faces are mentally ill", though in some parts of the world women have no choice but to cover their face, as they are "governed...by primitive pigs whose only achievement in life is to be born with a penis in one hand and a Quran in the other". Commissioner Elliot Cohen described Condells comments as "insulting, degenerating and racist".<ref name="chortle1">{{cite web

Condell then accused Cohen of being "motivated by his own narrow personal and political agenda which has nothing to do with [Condell] or the video clip". The video was initially sent to them by fellow Peace and Justice Commissioner Jonathan Wornick, who said it "tries to expose intolerance in the Muslim world", such as "the intolerance of Islamism radical Islamists who say if you insult Allah, you should have your head cut off".<ref name="berekely2">{{cite web

===YouTube censorship===
{{See also Criticism of Google#YouTube}}
Condells video Welcome to Saudi Britain was removed by YouTube early in October 2008, but reinstated shortly after. In it Condell criticises Britains sanctioning of a Sharia court, and refers to the entire country of Saudi Arabia as "mentally ill" for Womens rights in Saudi Arabia its abuse of women.<ref name="telegraphcensor" /><ref name="rdcensor" />

A YouTube spokesman said "YouTube has clear policies that prohibit inappropriate content on the site, such as pornography, gratuitous violence or hate speech.... If users repeatedly break these rules we disable their accounts." The National Secular Society was among the complainants to YouTube, saying "as usual, he (Condell) does not mince his words, but he is not saying anything that is untrue. His main thrust is one of outrage on behalf of those Muslim women who will suffer because they are forced to have their marital problems solved in a male-dominated Sharia court."<ref name="telegraphcensor">{{cite web

Shortly after, YouTube reversed their earlier decision saying "Upon further review of the context of Pat Condells comments, weve reinstated it." Richard Dawkins applauded the reversal, saying "I congratulate YouTube on an excellent decision. Pat Condell is hard-hitting, but always quietly reasonable in tone."<ref name="rdcensor">{{cite web
