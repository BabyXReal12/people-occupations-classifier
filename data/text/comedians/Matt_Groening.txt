Groening made his first professional cartoon sale of Life in Hell to the avant-garde Wet (magazine) Wet magazine in 1978. At its peak, the cartoon was carried in 250 weekly newspapers. Life in Hell caught the attention of James L. Brooks. In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation for the Fox Broadcasting Company Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his Life in Hell characters for the show. Fearing the loss of ownership rights, Groening decided to create something new and came up with a cartoon family, the Simpson family, and named the members after his own parents and sisters—while Bart Simpson Bart was an anagram of the word brat. The shorts would be spun off into their own series The Simpsons, which has since aired List of The Simpsons episodes {{:The Simpsons}} episodes. In 1997, Groening and former Simpsons writer David X.
