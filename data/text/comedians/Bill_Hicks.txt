==Early life==
Hicks was born in Valdosta, Georgia, the son of James Melvin "Jim" Hicks (1923–2006) and Mary Reese Hicks, the younger sibling of Lynn and Steve. The family lived in Florida, Alabama, and New Jersey before settling in Houston, Texas, when Bill was seven.<ref name="Bill Hicks 2004">Bill Hicks: Love All the People (Robinson Publishing, 2005), {{ISBN 978-1-84529-111-2}}, page #s?</ref> He was drawn to comedy at an early age, emulating Woody Allen and Richard Pryor, and writing routines with his friend Dwight Slade. At school he began performing comedy, mostly derivations of Woody Allen material, for his classmates.<ref>{{cite web title=Bill Hicks (Personal Life, Career) url=http://www.bestcomedyonline.net/comedian-biographies/bill-hicks-personal-life-career?iframe=true&width=95%&height=95% publisher=bestcomedyonline accessdate=July 16, 2013}}</ref> At home, he would write his own one-liners and slide them under the bedroom door of his brother Steve, the only family member Bill respected, for his critical analysis. "Keep it up", Steve told him. "Youre really good at this."<ref>True, C. American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story. London, Sidgwick & Jackson, 2002. {{ISBN 0380803771}}. p. 12.</ref>

Early on, Hicks began to mock his familys Southern Baptist Convention Southern Baptist religious beliefs. "We were Yuppie Baptists," he joked to the Houston Post in 1987. "We worried about things like, If you scratch your neighbors Subaru, should you leave a note?"<ref>True (2002), pp. 10–11.</ref> Biographer Cynthia True described a typical argument with his father: {{quote The elder Hicks would say, "I believe that the Bible is the literal word of God." And Bill would counter, "No its not, Dad." "Well, I believe that it is." "Well," Bill replied, "you know, some people believe that theyre Napoleon. Thats fine. Beliefs are neat. Cherish them, but dont share them like theyre the truth."<ref>True (2002), p. 44.</ref>}} Hicks did not, however, reject spiritual ideology itself, and throughout his life he sought various alternative methods of experiencing it. Kevin Slade, elder brother of Dwight, introduced him to Transcendental Meditation technique Transcendental Meditation and other forms of spirituality. Over one Thanksgiving weekend he took Hicks and Dwight to a TM residence course in Galveston.<ref>{{cite book   last = True   first= Cynthia  year =2002   title = American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story   publisher = HarperCollins Harper Paperbacks  isbn = 0380803771   page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qxa5uj95B84C&pg=PA25&dq=bill+hicks+transcendental+meditation&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QS8dUq_PG6iusATA1oHoBA&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=bill%20hicks%20transcendental%20meditation&f=false 25]}}</ref> Worried about his rebellious behavior, his parents took him to a psychoanalyst at age 17.

==Career==

===Beginnings===
Hicks was associated with the Texas Outlaw Comics group developed at the Comedy Workshop in Houston in the 1980s.<ref name="wati1991">Staff report (April 18, 1991). Texas outlaw fires from the lip.

===California and New York===
By January 1986, Hicks was using recreational drugs and his financial resources had dwindled.<ref name=official>{{cite web  url=http://billhicks.com/Bio.html  title=Bill Hicks  first=Paul  last=Outhwaite  publisher=Bill Hicks family official site  accessdate=2014-04-08  archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OgPQmr8H?url=http://billhicks.com/Bio.html  archivedate=April 8, 2014  deadurl=no  df=mdy }}</ref> However his career received another upturn in 1987, when he appeared on Rodney Dangerfields Young Comedians Special.<ref>{{cite book last1=Arp first1=Robert title=The Devil and Philosophy: The Nature of His Game (Popular Culture and Philosophy #83) date=2014 publisher=Open Court Pub Co isbn=978-0812698541}}</ref> The same year, he moved to New York City, and for the next five years performed about 300 times a year.<ref name=officialbio>{{cite web last1=Outhwaite first1=Paul title=Bio url=http://www.billhicks.com/bio.html website=Arizona Bay Production Company, Inc. language=en}}</ref> On the album Relentless, he jokes that he quit using drugs because "once youve been taken aboard a UFO, its kind of hard to top that", although in his performances, he continued to extol the virtues of Lysergic acid diethylamide LSD, cannabis (drug) marijuana, and psilocybin mushroom psychedelic mushrooms.<ref>See Sane Man and Rant in E Minor.</ref>

He eventually fell back to chain smoking,<ref>{{cite web author=Jason Ankeny  url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-hicks-mn0000077267/biography  title=Bill Hicks &#124; Biography  publisher=AllMusic  accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref> a theme that would figure heavily in his performances from then on. His nicotine addiction, love of smoking, and occasional attempts to quit became a recurring theme in his act throughout his later years.

In 1988, Hicks signed on with his first professional business manager, Jack Mondrus.<ref>{{cite web last1=Strongman first1=Phil title=Bill Hicks: 25 years on from the cult comedians big break • The Register url=https://m.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/19/feature_comedy_bill_hicks/ website=The Register publisher=Situation Publishing language=en}}</ref>

On the track "Modern Bummer" of his 1990 album Dangerous (Bill Hicks album) Dangerous, Hicks says he quit drinking alcohol in 1988.

In 1989, he released his first video, Sane Man; a remastered version with 30 minutes of extra footage was released in 1999.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2000-06-02/bill-hicks-sane-man/  title=Bill Hicks ...

In 1990, Hicks released his first album, Dangerous, performed on the HBO special One Night Stand, and performed at Montreals Just for Laughs festival.<ref name=official /> He was also part of a group of American stand-up comedians performing in Londons West End in November. Hicks was a huge hit in the UK and Ireland and continued touring there throughout 1991.<ref>{{cite web title=Bill Hicks url=http://www.icomedytv.com/Top-Comedians/ID/366/Bill-Hicks.aspx publisher=icomedytv accessdate=July 16, 2013 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703084554/http://www.icomedytv.com/Top-Comedians/ID/366/Bill-Hicks.aspx archivedate=July 3, 2013 df=mdy-all}}</ref> That year, he returned to Just for Laughs and filmed his second video, Relentless.

Hicks made a brief detour into musical recording with the Marble Head Johnson album in 1992 collaborating with Houston high school friend Kevin Booth and Austin Texas drummer Pat Brown. During the same year he toured the UK, where he recorded the Revelations video<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.billhicks.com/  title=Flash Intro Page  publisher= Bill Hicks family official site  date=December 9, 2013  accessdate=2013-12-21}}</ref> for Channel 4. He closed the show with his soon-to become-famous philosophy regarding life, "Its Just a Ride." Also in that tour he recorded the stand-up performance released in its entirety on a double CD entitled, Salvation. Hicks was voted "Hot Standup Comic" by Rolling Stone Rolling Stone magazine in 1993. He moved to Los Angeles in 1992.{{Citation needed date=August 2011}}

===Hicks and Tool===
Progressive metal band Tool (band) Tool invited Hicks to open a number of concerts in its 1993 Lollapalooza appearances, where Hicks once asked the audience to look for a contact lens he had lost. Thousands of people complied.<ref>{{cite web  url = http://www.fadetoblack.com/interviews/billhicks/13.html   title = Its Only a Ride: Bill Hicks Question & Answer with Kevin Booth   publisher= FadeToBlack.com   author = Interview with Kevin Booth accessdate = March 3, 2006  archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050829101024/http://www.fadetoblack.com/interviews/billhicks/13.html  archivedate = August 29, 2005}}</ref>

Members of Tool felt that they and Hicks "were resonating similar concepts".<ref name="austinkeenanhicks">{{Cite news  url=http://toolshed.down.net/articles/index.php?action=view-article&id=May_1997--The_Austin_Chronicle.html  title = Another Dead Hero

An alternate version of the Ænima artwork shows a painting of Bill Hicks, calling him "Another Dead Hero," and mentions of Hicks are found both in the liner notes and on the record.

===Censorship and aftermath===
In 1984, Hicks was invited to appear on Late Night with David Letterman for the first time. He had a joke that he used frequently in comedy clubs about how he caused a serious accident that left a classmate using a wheelchair. NBC had a policy that no handicapped jokes could be aired on the show, making his stand-up routine difficult to perform without mentioning words such as "wheelchair."{{citation needed date=February 2015 reason=Quotations must be verifiably attributed to a reliable source per MOS:QUOTE}}

On October 1, 1993, Hicks was scheduled to appear on Late Show with David Letterman on CBS, where Letterman had recently moved. It was his 12th appearance on a Letterman late-night show, but his entire performance was removed from the broadcast: until that point the only occasion where a comedians entire routine was cut after taping.<ref name=Lahr>{{Cite news  authorlink = John Lahr first = John last= Lahr  title = The Goat Boy Rises  url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/11/01/1993_11_01_113_TNY_CARDS_000365503?currentPage=all   work = The New Yorker date=November 1, 1993  archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430075226/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/11/01/1993_11_01_113_TNY_CARDS_000365503?currentPage=all   archivedate= April 30, 2008   deadurl=no}}</ref> Hicks stand-up routine was removed from the show, Hicks said, because Lettermans producers believed the material, which included jokes involving religion and the Opposition to the legalization of abortion anti-abortion movement, was unsuitable for broadcast.<ref name=Lahr/> Producer Robert Morton initially blamed CBS, which denied responsibility; Morton later conceded it was his decision.<ref name=Lahr/> Although Letterman later expressed regret at the way Hicks had been handled, Hicks did not appear on the show again.<ref name= Lahr/> Hicks was actively undergoing chemotherapy at the time of his final Late Show appearance, unbeknownst to Letterman and most others outside of Hicks immediate family, and died less than four months later.<ref>True, 2002, pp. 193–214)</ref>

Letterman finally aired the censored routine in its entirety on January 30, 2009. Hickss mother, Mary, was present in the studio and appeared on-camera as a guest. Letterman took responsibility for the original decision to remove Hickss set from the 1993 show. "It says more about me as a guy than it says about Bill," he said, after the set aired, "because there was absolutely nothing wrong with that."<ref>{{Citation  last=Korn first=Steven title=David Letterman Airs the Lost Bill Hicks Routine  work= Entertainment Weekly  date=February 3, 2009  url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/02/03/david-letterman/  accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref><ref name = Letterman>{{Cite news  last=Crosbie  first=Lynn  title=The Globe Review Column; Pop Rocks; A Pop-Culture Epiphany; David Lettermans Apology to Mary Hicks  publisher=The Globe and Mail  date=February 3, 2009  page=R1}}</ref>

===Influence on Denis Leary===
For many years, Hicks was friends with fellow comedian Denis Leary. But in 1993, Hicks was angered by Learys album No Cure for Cancer, which featured lines and subject matter similar to Hicks routine.<ref name="Outhwaite"><!-- cite book --> Outhwaite, Paul (November 2003). One Consciousness: An Analysis of Bill Hickss Comedy, 3rd edition, D.M. Productions. {{ISBN 0-9537461-3-5}}.</ref> According to American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story by Cynthia True, upon hearing the album Bill was furious. "All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Learys lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff, and even bought bits from one another. Milton Berle and Robin Williams were famous for it. This was different. Leary had practically taken line for line huge chunks of Bills act and recorded it."<ref name = "oouuos"/> The friendship ended abruptly as a result.<ref name="evolutionBook">{{Cite book  title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution  first=Kevin  last=Booth  first2= Michael last2= Bertin  year=2005   publisher=Harper Collins

At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole Hickss material as well as his persona and attitude.<ref>{{cite web  url = http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92  archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070607224107/http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/92  archivedate = June 7, 2007  title = Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief

This joke was cut from the final broadcast.<ref>{{Cite news  title=Roasting a Comic They Turn Up the Flames Gently  work=Boston Globe  url=http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml  archiveurl=https://archive.is/20030811054820/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml  archivedate=August 11, 2003  date=August 10, 2003  deadurl=yes  df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The controversy surrounding plagiarism is also mentioned in American Scream:

{{quote text=Leary was in Montreal hosting the "Nasty Show" at Club Soda, and Colleen [McGarr?] was coordinating the talent so she stood backstage and overheard Leary doing material incredibly similar to old Hicks riffs, including his perennial Jim Fixx joke: "Keith Richards outlived Jim Fixx, the runner and health nut. The plot thickens." When Leary came offstage, Colleen, more stunned than angry, said, "Hey, you know thats Bill Hickss material! Do you know thats his material?" Leary stood there, stared at her without saying a word, and briskly left the dressing room.<ref name = "oouuos">{{Cite book  first = Cynthia last= True  title = American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story  year=2002  publisher=Harper Paperbacks  isbn=0-380-80377-1}}</ref>}}

==Material and style==
Hickss performance style was seen as a play on his audiences emotions. He expressed anger, disgust, and apathy while addressing the audience in a casual and personal manner, which he likened to merely conversing with his friends. He would invite his audiences to challenge authority and the existential nature of "accepted truth." One such message, which he often used in his shows, was delivered in the style of a news report (in order to draw attention to the negative slant news organizations give to any story about drugs):
{{quote Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration—that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and were the imagination of ourselves. Heres Tom with the weather.<ref>Extract from Revelations (Bill Hicks) Revelations, London, 1993. The extract is part of the concluding track to the album, called "Its Just a Ride", in which he essentially outlines his world view.</ref>}}

The American philosopher and ethnomycology ethnomycologist Terence McKenna was a frequent source of Hicks most controversial psychedelic and philosophical counter-cultural material; he infamously acted out an abridged version of McKennas "Stoned Ape" model of human evolution as a routine during several of his final shows.<ref name="McKenna2013">{{cite web last1=McKenna first1=Terrence title=Terrence Mckenna – The stoned ape theory url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnEKoFrx1rI website=YouTube.com accessdate=September 3, 2016 date=August 15, 2013}}</ref><ref name="StonedApe1993">{{cite web title=Bill Hicks – The stoned ape- theory in 3 minutes url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hreGAxAjt1c website=YouTube.com publisher=Anders Jacobsson accessdate=September 3, 2016 date=1993}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media  first= Bill  last= Hicks  authorlink= Bill Hicks  year= 1997  origyear= November 1992 – December 1993  title= Rant in E-Minor (CD and MP3)  time= 0:58  chapter= Pt. 1: Ch. 2: Gifts of Forgiveness  at= Track 8  publisher= Rykodisc  oclc= 38306915}}</ref>

Another of Hickss most quoted lines was delivered during a gig in Chicago in 1989 (later released as the bootleg Im Sorry, Folks). After a heckler repeatedly shouted "Free Bird#Legacy Free Bird", Hicks screamed that "Adolf Hitler Hitler had the right idea; he was just an underachiever!" Hicks followed this remark with a misanthropic tirade calling for unbiased genocide against the whole of humanity.<ref>True, Cynthia, American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story, Pan Macmillan, 2008, p.127.</ref><ref>Hound, Rufus, Stand-Up Put-Downs, Random House, 2011, p.59.</ref>

Much of Hickss routine involved direct attacks on mainstream society, religion, politics, and consumerism. Asked in a BBC interview why he cannot do a routine that appeals "to everyone", he said that such an act was impossible. He responded by repeating a comment that an audience member once made to him, "We dont come to comedy to think!", to which he replied, "Gee, where do you go to think? Ill meet you there!" When asked whether there was a "half way" point between audience expectations and his own, he said: "but my way is half-way between, I mean, this is a night-club, and, you know, these are adults, and what do you expect?"<ref>Hicks, Bill, Love All the People: Letters, Lyrics, Routines, Hachette UK, 2009, unpaginated.</ref>

Hicks often discussed popular conspiracy theories in his performances, most notably the Assassination of John F. Kennedy assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He mocked the Warren Report and the official version of Lee Harvey Oswald as a "lone nut assassin." He also questioned the guilt of David Koresh and the Branch Davidian compound during the Waco Siege. Hicks would end some of his shows, especially those being recorded in front of larger audiences as albums, with a mock "assassination" of himself on stage, making gunshot sound effects into the microphone while falling to the ground.

==Cancer diagnosis==
On June 16, 1993, Hicks was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer that had spread to his liver.<ref name="hicks-lastword">{{cite web  first = Bill last= Hicks  title = Last Word  url = http://www.billhicks.com/last-word.html  publisher= Bill Hicks  work=Bill Hicks family official site   accessdate = June 5, 2007 archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070521205803/http://www.billhicks.com/last-word.html  archivedate = May 21, 2007}}</ref>
He started receiving weekly chemotherapy, while still touring and also recording his album, Arizona Bay, with Booth. He was also working with comedian Fallon Woodland on a pilot episode of a new talk show, entitled Counts of the Netherworld for Channel 4 at the time of his death. The budget and concept had been approved, and a pilot episode pilot was filmed. The Counts of the Netherworld pilot was shown at the various Tenth Anniversary Tribute Night events around the world on February 26, 2004. After being diagnosed with cancer, Hicks would often joke that any given performance could be his last; the public, however, was unaware of his condition, and only a few close friends and family members knew of the disease. He performed the final show of his career at Carolines in New York on January 6, 1994; he moved back to his parents house in Little Rock, Arkansas Little Rock, Arkansas, shortly thereafter. He called his friends to say goodbye before he stopped speaking on February 14.<ref>{{cite web last1=Outhwaite first1=Paul url=http://billhicks.com/Bio.html title=Bio publisher=Arizona Production Company, Inc. accessdate=2016-03-03}}</ref>

In early 1995 his family released a brief essay that Hicks had written a week prior to his death:

{{quote text=I was born William Melvin Hicks on December 16, 1961 in Valdosta, Georgia. Ugh. Melvin Hicks from Georgia. Yee Har! I already had gotten off to life on the wrong foot.

All of this came out years down the line, in my multitude of creative interests that are the tools I now bring to the Party. Writing, acting, music, comedy. A deep love of literature and books. Thank God for all the artists whove helped me. Id read these words and off I went – dreaming my own imaginative dreams. Exercising them at will, eventually to form bands, comedy, more bands, movies, anything creative. This is the coin of the realm I use in my words – Vision. On June 16, 1993 I was diagnosed with having "liver cancer that had spread from the pancreas." One of lifes weirdest and worst jokes imaginable. Id been making such progress recently in my attitude, my career and realizing my dreams that it just stood me on my head for a while. "Why me!?" I would cry out, and "Why now!?" Well, I know now there may never be any answers to those particular questions, but maybe in telling a little about myself, we can find some other answers to other questions. That might help our way down our own particular paths, towards realizing my dream of New Hope and New Happiness. Amen. I left in love, in laughter, and in truth and wherever truth, love and laughter abide, I am there in spirit.<ref name = "hicks-lastword"/>}}
