From 1947, Arthur studied at the Dramatic Workshop of The New School in New York, N.Y. with German director Erwin Piscator. Arthur began her acting career as a member of an off Broadway theater group at the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York City in the mid 1940s. On stage, her roles included Lucy Brown in the 1954 Off-Broadway premiere of Marc Blitzsteins English-language adaptation of Kurt Weills The Threepenny Opera, Nadine Fesser in the 1957 premiere of Herman Wouks Natures Way at the Coronet Theatre, Yente the Matchmaker in the 1964 premiere of Fiddler on the Roof on Broadway, and a 1966 Tony Award-winning portrayal of Vera Charles to Angela Lansburys Mame (musical) Mame. She reprised the role in the Mame (film) unsuccessful 1974 film version opposite Lucille Ball. In 1981, she appeared in Woody Allens The Floating Light Bulb.<ref>{{cite web title=Bea Arthur url=http://www.playbillvault.com/Person/Detail/24703/Bea-Arthur work=Playbill.com publisher=Playbill, Inc accessdate=November 15, 2013}}</ref>

She made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1994 portraying the Duchess of Krakenthorp, a speaking role, in Gaetano Donizettis La fille du régiment.<ref name="opera">{{cite news url=http://www.operanews.com/operanews/templates/content.aspx?id=2299 title=Obituaries: Actors Dom DeLuise and Beatrice Arthur; mezzo Margreta Elkins; soprano Anne Brown, Gershwins original Bess; composer Lukas Foss dies at eighty-six. work=Opera News date=July 2009 volume=74 issue=1 accessdate=December 28, 2010}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

===Television===
In 1971, Arthur was invited by Norman Lear to guest-star on his sitcom All in the Family, as Maude Findlay, the cousin of Edith Bunker. An outspoken liberal feminist, Maude was the antithesis role to the conservative Republican character Archie Bunker, who described her as a "New Deal fanatic". Nearly 50, Arthurs tart turn on All in the Family impressed viewers as well as executives at CBS who, she would later recall, asked "Who is that girl? Lets give her her own series."<ref>{{cite news title=Golden Girls Star Be Arthur Dies at 86 publisher=NPR date=April 25, 2009 url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103494550 accessdate=April 27, 2009 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427165314/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103494550 archivedate= April 27, 2009 deadurl=no}}</ref>

That series, previewed in her second All in the Family appearance, would be simply titled "Maude (pilot) Maude". The show, debuting in 1972, found her living in the affluent community of Tuckahoe, Westchester County, New York, with her fourth husband Walter (Bill Macy) and divorced daughter Carol (Adrienne Barbeau). Her performance in the role garnered Arthur several Emmy and Golden Globe nominations, including her Emmy win in 1977 for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. Maude would also earn a place for Arthur in the history of the womens liberation movement.<ref>{{cite web author= title=Feminist Timeline: United States url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_timeline/plain_text.php work=Feminist Timeline: United States publisher=Brooklyn Museum accessdate=April 27, 2009 quote="The television show Maude, a spin-off of All in the Family, premiers, starring Beatrice Arthur as Maude Findlay, a leftist feminist who supports abortion and civil rights."}}</ref>

The series addressed serious sociopolitical topics of the era that were considered taboo for a sitcom, including the Vietnam War, the Nixon Administration, Maudes bid for a United States Congress Congressional seat, divorce, menopause, Substance abuse drug use, alcoholism, nervous breakdown, mental illness, womens lib, gay rights, abortion, and spousal abuse. A prime example is "Maudes Dilemma", a two-part episode airing near Thanksgiving of 1972 in which Maudes character grapples with a late-life pregnancy, ultimately deciding to have an abortion.<ref>Maudes Dilemma. IMDB. September 2017. https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0793153/</ref> 
Even though abortion was legal in New York State since 1970, as well as in California since its states 1969 on-demand ruling, it was illegal in many other regions of the country and, as such, sparked controversy. As a result, dozens of Network affiliate affiliates refused to broadcast the episode when it was originally scheduled, substituting either a repeat from earlier in the season or a Thanksgiving TV special in its place. However, by the time of the summer rerun season six months later all the flak had died down, and the stations that refused to air the episode upon its first run reinstated it for the reruns the following summer. As a result, a reported 65 million viewers watched the two episode arc either in their first run that November or during the following summer as a rerun.<ref>{{cite web author= title=Susan Harris  url=http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=32  accessdate=April 27, 2009  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021142015/http://www.shemadeit.org/meet/biography.aspx?m=32  archivedate=October 21, 2007  df=mdy }}</ref> The episode initially aired two months before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized the procedure nationwide in the Roe v.

By 1978, however, Arthur decided to move on from the series. Later the same year (1978), she costarred in Star Wars Holiday Special, in which she had a song and dance routine in the Mos Eisley Cantina. She hosted The Beatrice Arthur Special on CBS on January 19, 1980, which paired the star in a musical comedy revue with Rock Hudson, Melba Moore and Wayland Flowers and Madame.<ref>{{cite news last=Hall first=Phil title=The Bootleg Files: "the Beatrice Arthur Special" url=http://www.filmthreat.com/features/1010 accessdate=November 15, 2013 newspaper=Film Threat date=March 26, 2004 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127021641/http://www.filmthreat.com/features/1010 archivedate=January 27, 2011}}</ref>

Arthur returned to television in the short-lived 1983 sitcom Amandas (an adaptation of the British series Fawlty Towers). Unfortunately, the show was a not a hit with audiences and only 10 of the 13 filmed episodes actually aired.

In 1985, Arthur was cast in The Golden Girls, in which she played Dorothy Zbornak, a divorced substitute teacher living in a Miami house owned by widow Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan). Her other roommates included widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and Dorothys Sicily Sicilian mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty). Getty was actually a year younger than Arthur in real life. The series was a hit, and remained a top-ten ratings fixture for six of its seven seasons. Her performance led to several Emmy nominations over the course of the series and an Emmy win in 1988. Arthur decided to leave the show after seven years, and in 1992 the show was moved from NBC to CBS and retooled as The Golden Palace in which the other three actresses reprised their roles, with Cheech Marin as their new foil. Arthur made a guest appearance in a two-part episode, but the new series lasted only one season.<ref>{{cite news last1=Hayward first1=Anthony title=Bea Arthur: Actress who found fame as the acid-tongued Dorothy in The Golden Girls sitcom url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/bea-arthur-actress-who-found-fame-as-the-acidtongued-dorothy-in-the-golden-girls-sitcom-1675213.html accessdate=June 13, 2014 work=The Independent date=April 28, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news last1=Ferguson first1=Lee title=And then theres Bea: Remembering Bea Arthur url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/arts/things-that-go-pop-blog/2009/04/and-then-theres-bea-remembering-bea-arthur.html accessdate=June 13, 2014 work=CBC News date=April 27, 2009}}</ref>

Regarding politics, Arthur herself was a liberalism liberal Democratic Party (United States) Democrat who confirmed her views by saying, "Ive been a Democrat my whole life.

Arthur was also a mentor, surrogate mother and a friend to Adrienne Barbeau, who co-starred, opposite her on Maude. For 6 seasons, they had a wonderful chemistry together, while her younger co-star was unavailable for the last 2 seasons, due to her busy scheduling, Barbeau remained close to Arthur, and stayed in touch until Arthurs passing. Barbeau said in a 2018 interview with Dread Central.com about her on- and off-screen chemistry with her TV mother was: "I was doing an interview for this 1-woman show that I am doing and the interviewer asked that... she asked: What do people usually ask you, and I said, They always want to know ... What It Was Like Working with Bea? She was fantastic and you know, I realized years later, how much I took it for granted, because it was my first experience on television... I just assumed that everyone was as giving as she was, as professional a she was that everyone who was doing a TV show, showed up, knowing their lines and showed up on time and was willing to say to the writers: I think this line was funnier if Adie had said it, or Conrad had said it or Bill had said it, I mean, she was just the best, she was the best, very funny, she was not Maude, when she wasnt saying those lines. I dont know if I say she was quiet, she was a homebody. She had her sons, her dog and her cooking and she wasnt into the celebrity scene and she was a great lady. I loved her dearly, and we had a great cast and they were my family for 6 years that I loved each of them and all of them and it was the best experience anyone couldve had, being introduced to television, like that!"<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/268471/brainwaves-episode-80-legendary-actress-adrienne-barbeau-listen-now title=Brainwaves Episode 80: Legendary Actress Adrienne Barbeau publisher=dreadcentral.com date=March 8, 2018  accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref>
