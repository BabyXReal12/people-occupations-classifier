Seinfeld created The Seinfeld Chronicles with Larry David in 1988 for NBC. The show was later renamed Seinfeld to avoid confusion with the short-lived teen sitcom The Marshall Chronicles. By its fourth season, it had become the most popular and successful sitcom on American television. The final episode aired in 1998, and the show has been a popular Television syndication syndicated re-run.

Along with Seinfeld, the show starred Saturday Night Live veteran Julia Louis-Dreyfus and experienced actors Michael Richards and Jason Alexander. Alexander played George, a caricature of Larry David. Seinfeld is the only actor to appear in every episode of the show.<ref>Jason Alexander did not appear in "The Pen"; Julia Louis-Dreyfus did not appear in The Seinfeld Chronicles the pilot, "The Trip, Part 1", or "The Trip, Part 2"; and Michael Richards did not appear in "The Chinese Restaurant" or "The Pen."</ref>

Seinfeld has said that his show was influenced by the 1950s sitcom The Abbott and Costello Show. In the "Seinfeld Season 6" DVD set, commenting on the episode "The Gymnast", Seinfeld cited Jean Shepherd as an influence, saying, "He really formed my entire comedic sensibility—I learned how to do comedy from Jean Shepherd."

From 2004 to 2007, the former Seinfeld cast and crew recorded audio commentaries for episodes of the DVD releases of the show. Seinfeld provided commentary for multiple episodes.

===Post-Seinfeld===
After he ended his sitcom, Seinfeld returned to New York City to make a comeback with his stand-up comedy rather than stay in Los Angeles and continue his acting career. In 1998 he went on tour and recorded a comedy special, titled Im Telling You for the Last Time. The process of developing and performing new material at clubs around the world was chronicled in a 2002 documentary, Comedian (film) Comedian, which also featured fellow comic Orny Adams and was directed by Christian Charles. Seinfeld has written several books, mostly archives of past routines.

In the late 1990s, Apple Computer came up with the advertising slogan "Think different" and produced a 60-second commercial to promote the slogan. This commercial showed people who were able to "think differently", such as Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., and many others. It was later cut short to 30 seconds and altered such that Seinfeld was included at the end, whereas he had not been in the original cut. This shorter version of the commercial aired only once, during the The Finale (Seinfeld) series finale of Seinfeld.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/mov/jerrysteinfield.mov  title=Seinfelds commercial  accessdate=August 22, 2011  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716221221/http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/mov/jerrysteinfield.mov  archivedate=July 16, 2011  df=mdy-all }}</ref>
