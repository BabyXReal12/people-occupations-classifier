==Career==
Reiner performed in several Broadway theatre Broadway musicals (including Inside U.S.A. and Alive and Kicking (musical) Alive and Kicking) and had the lead role in Call Me Mister. In 1950, he was cast by Max Leibman in Sid Caesars Your Show of Shows, appearing on air in skits while also working alongside writers, such as Mel Brooks and Neil Simon. Reiner also worked on Caesars Hour with Brooks, Simon, Larry Gelbart, Mel Tolkin, Mike Stewart, Aaron Ruben, Sheldon Keller, and Gary Belkin.

Starting in 1960, Reiner teamed with Brooks as a Double act comedy duo on The Steve Allen Show. Their performances on television and stage included Reiner playing the straight man in 2000 Year Old Man. Eventually, the routine expanded into a series of 5 comedy albums and a 1975 animated television special, with the last album in the series winning a Grammy Award for Spoken Comedy Album.<ref>video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI7wDpBRqjo "The 2000 Year Old Man - Created and Performed by Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner"]</ref><ref>{{cite web title=41st Annual Grammy Awards winners url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=The+2000+Year+Old+Man&year=1998 publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, Inc accessdate=April 17, 2011}}</ref> The act gave Brooks "an identity as a comic performer for the first time," said Reiner.<ref name=Nachman>Nachman, Gerald.

{{quote The routine relies totally on the teams mental agility and chemistry. Its almost heresy to imagine Brooks performing it with any other straight man.

In 1959, Reiner developed a television pilot titled Head of the Family, based on his own personal and professional life. However, the network did not like Reiner in the lead role for unknown reasons. In 1961, it was recast and re-titled The Dick Van Dyke Show and became an iconic series, making stars of his lead actors Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore. In addition to writing many of the episodes, Reiner occasionally appeared as temperamental show host Alan Brady. The series ran from 1961 to 1966. In 1966, Reiner co-starred in The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming.

On The Dick Van Dyke Show, he began his directing career. After the series ended its run, his first film feature was an adaptation of Joseph Steins play Enter Laughing (1967), which, in turn, was based on Reiners semi-autobiographical 1958 novel of the same name. Balancing directing, producing, writing, and acting, Reiner has worked on a wide range of films and television programs. Films from his early directing career included Wheres Poppa? (1970), Oh, God! (film) Oh, God! (1977), and The Jerk (film) The Jerk (1979).

In one of his memoirs, he writes, "Of all the films I have directed, only Wheres Poppa? is universally acknowledged as a cult classic. A cult classic, as you may know, is a film that was seen by a small minority of the worlds film goers, who insist it is one of the greatest, most daring, and innovative moving pictures ever made. Whenever two or more cult members meet, they will quote dialogue from the classic and agree that the film was ahead of its time. To be designated a genuine cult classic, it is of primary importance that the film fail to earn back the cost of making, marketing, and distributing it. Where’s Poppa? was made in 1969 for a little over $1 million. According to the last distribution statements I saw, it will not break even until it earns another $650,000."<ref>Carl Reiner, My Anecdotal Life (New York: St. Martins, 2003).</ref>

Reiner had a large role in the early career of Steve Martin, by directing and co-writing four films for the comedian: The Jerk in 1979, Dead Men Dont Wear Plaid in 1982, The Man with Two Brains in 1983, and All of Me (1984 film) All of Me in 1984. Reiner also appeared in both The Jerk and Dead Men Dont Wear Plaid.

In 1989, he directed Bert Rigby, Youre a Fool. In 1990, he narrated the Grimm childrens story "The Musicians of Bremen" (music by Bernard Rogers) for a CD of classical music for children. In 2000, Reiner was honored with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. A year later, he portrayed Saul Bloom in Steven Soderberghs remake of Oceans Eleven (2001 film) Oceans Eleven, and later reprised the role in Oceans Twelve (2004) and Oceans Thirteen (2007). From 2004 to 2005, Reiner voiced Sarmoti in Father of the Pride.

Reiner is the author of several books, including his 2004 memoir My Anecdotal Life: A Memoir and novels, such as his 2006 novel NNNNN: A Novel. In American Film, he expressed his philosophy on writing comedy: "You have to imagine yourself as not somebody very special, but somebody very ordinary. If you imagine yourself as somebody really normal and if it makes you laugh, its going to make everybody laugh. If you think of yourself as something very special, youll end up a pedant and a bore. If you start thinking about whats funny, you wont be funny, actually. Its like walking. How do you walk? If you start thinking about it, youll trip."

In May 2009, he guest-starred as a clinic patient on the Both Sides Now (House) season finale of House (TV series) House. Reiner also voiced Santa Claus Santa in Merry Madagascar and reprised his role in the The Penguins of Madagascar Penguins of Madagascar episode "The All Nighter Before Christmas." In December 2009, he guest-starred as a television producer on Two and a Half Men.

In June 2010, Reiner guest starred in Hot in Cleveland as Elka Ostrovskys date and reprised the role in July. He also made appearances in The Cleveland Show as Murray and wrote the story for the episode "Your Show of Shows (The Cleveland Show) Your Show of Shows", named after the program that started his career. In October 2013 and January 2014, Reiner reprised his role on Two and a Half Men.
