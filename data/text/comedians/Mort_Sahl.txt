Morton Lyon "Mort" Sahl (born May 11, 1927) is a Canadians Canadian-born American stand-up comedian, actor and social satirist, considered the first modern stand-up comedian since Will Rogers.<ref name=Weide/><ref name=Time/> Sahl pioneered a style of social satire which pokes fun at political and current event topics using improvised monologues and only a newspaper as a prop.

Sahl spent his early years in Los Angeles and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where he made his professional stage debut at the hungry i nightclub in 1953. His popularity grew quickly, and after a year at the club he traveled the country doing shows at established nightclubs, theaters and college campuses. In 1960 he became the first comedian to have a cover story written about him by Time magazine. He appeared on various television shows, played a number of film roles, and performed a one-man show on Broadway.

Television host Steve Allen claimed that Sahl was "the only real political philosopher we have in modern comedy." His social satire performances broke new ground in live entertainment, as a stand-up comic talking about the real world of politics at that time was considered "revolutionary." It inspired many later comics to become stage comedians, including Lenny Bruce, Jonathan Winters, George Carlin and Woody Allen. Allen credits Sahls new style of humor with "opening up vistas for people like me."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 545}}

Numerous politicians became his fans, with John F. Kennedy asking him to write his jokes for campaign speeches. After Kennedys assassination in 1963, however, Sahl became obsessed with what he saw as the Warren Reports inaccuracy and conclusions, and spoke about it often during his shows. This alienated much of his audience and led to a decline in his popularity for the remainder of the 1960s. By the 1970s, however, his shows and popularity staged a partial comeback which continues to the present.<ref name=Hopper>[http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/weekend-post/mort-sahl-invented-stand-up-comedy-so-whats-he-doing-at-a-community-theatre-in-northern-california "Mort Sahl invented stand-up comedy — so what’s he doing at a community theatre in Northern California?"], National Post, May 25, 2015</ref> A biography of Sahl, Last Man Standing, by James Curtis (biographer) James Curtis, was released in 2017.<ref name=bio>[http://www.ocregister.com/2017/06/02/comedian-mort-sahl-and-biographer-james-curtis-talk-about-last-man-standing-the-story-of-sahls-fearless-funny-life/ "Comedian Mort Sahl and biographer James Curtis talk about ‘Last Man Standing,’ the story of Sahl’s fearless, funny life"], Orange County Register, June 2, 2017</ref>

==Early life==
Sahl was born on May 11, 1927 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada,<ref name=master/> the only child of Jewish parents.<ref name=Nachman>{{cite book last1=Nachman first1=Gerald author-link1=Gerald Nachman (journalist) title=Seriously Funny  script-title=The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s url=http://geraldnachman.com/about.html location=New York publisher=Pantheon Books publication-date=2003 page=659 isbn=9780375410307 oclc=50339527}}</ref> His father, Harry Sahl, came from an immigrant family on New Yorks Lower East Side, and hoped to become a Broadway playwright. He met his wife when she responded to an advertisement he took out in a poetry magazine. Unable to break into the writing field they moved to Canada where he owned a tobacco store in Montreal.<ref name=Time>Time magazine, August 15, 1960, pp. 44-48</ref>

The family later relocated to Los Angeles Los Angeles, California where his father, unable to become a Hollywood writer, worked as a clerk and court reporter for the FBI. Sahl notes, "My dad was disappointed in his dreams and he distrusted that world for me."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 55}} Sahl went to Belmont High School (Los Angeles, California) Belmont High School in Los Angeles where he wrote for the schools newspaper. Actor Richard Crenna was a classmate.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 55}}

When the U.S. entered World War II after Pearl Harbor, Sahl, then fourteen, joined the schools Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC). He won a medal for marksmanship and an American Legion Americanism award.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 55}} Wanting to express his patriotism, he wore his ROTC uniform to school and in public<ref name=Time/> and, when he turned fifteen, he dropped out of high school to join the Army by lying about his age.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 55}} His mother tracked him down and brought him back home two weeks later after she revealed his true age.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 55}}

Upon graduating from high school, his father tried to get him into West Point and had received his Congressmans help.<ref name=Time/> But Sahl had by then already enlisted in the United States Air Force. He was later stationed in Alaska with the 93rd Air Depot Group. In the military, however, he resisted the discipline and authoritarian control it had over his life. He expressed his nonconformity by growing a beard and refusing to wear a cap as required. He also wrote articles for a small newspaper criticizing the military, which resulted in his being penalized with three months of KP duty.<ref name=Time/>

He was discharged in 1947 and enrolled in Compton College, followed by the University of Southern California. He received a B.S. degree in 1950 with majors in traffic engineering (transportation) traffic engineering and city management.<ref name=Time/><ref name=master/> He continued with the masters program but dropped out to become an actor and playwright.<ref name=Time/>

==Career==

===Breaking into comedy===
Between 1950 and 1953 he tried to get jobs as a stand-up comedian in about 30 nightclubs throughout Los Angeles, but with no success. NBC, where he once auditioned, told him he would never succeed as a comedian.<ref name=Time/> He even offered to perform free during intermissions for the chance to show his talent. He recalls that period: "Despite all the folklore about the faith of friends in the struggling young artist, my friends constantly discouraged me."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 56}} He and a friend then rented an old theater, which they called Theater X, for "experimental," and he began writing and staging one-act plays. One of his plays was titled "Nobody Trusted the Truth."<ref name=Time/> But unable to attract a large enough audience, they eventually closed the theater.

For income, Sahl began doing odd jobs and writing. He worked as a used car salesman and a messenger, and wrote an unpublished novel and short stories. He went to New York hoping to sell his plays, but only managed to earn about eighteen dollars a week. He recalls, "I couldnt get a thing going. I was working on a novel, I was out of work, and I was out of gas."<ref name=Nachman/> As a result, he decided to try something different, by performing his plays as monologues. He felt it would be easier to do his monologue on stage instead of trying to sell it to others.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 56}} "I knew that if I was going to get anything done, Id have to do it myself," he says.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 56}} He returned to Los Angeles where he appeared at some clubs but his new style of monologue comedy received little attention.

In 1953 he began dating Sue Babior. When she moved to Berkeley to study at the University of California, Berkeley University of California, Sahl hitchhiked there to be with her. He spent his time auditing classes and hanging out at local coffee houses. For income he wrote for a few avant-garde publications. He slept in the back seat of a friends car since Babior was living with roommates. "Things were simple then," he says. "All we had to worry about was the destiny of man."<ref name=Playboy>Playboy magazine, February, 1969</ref> He felt at home in the San Francisco Bay Area, commenting, "I was born in San Francisco." The three years he lived in Berkeley were a valuable experience, he said.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 57}}

He sought out any clubs where he could perform as a stand-up, and Babior suggested he audition for the hungry i, a nightclub in San Francisco.<ref name=master/> Its owner, Enrico Banducci, took an immediate liking to Sahls comedy style and offered him a job at $75 a week, which became his first steady job as a stand-up comedian.<ref name=Time/>

Word about Sahls satirical comedy acts spread quickly. He received good reviews from influential newspaper columnist, Herb Caen, which gave him instant credibility: "I dont know where Mr. Sahl came from but Im glad hes here," he wrote after watching his show.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 62}} Caen began inviting his own friends, such as film comedians Danny Kaye and Eddie Cantor, to watch Sahls performances.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 62}} Cantor took him "under his wing" and gave him suggestions.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 71}}By the end of his first year at the hungry i, Sahl was earning $3,000 a week and performing to packed houses. "Id be washing cars if it werent for Enrico," he said later in his career, appreciating that Banducci was the first club owner to give him the chance to perform as a stand-up comedian.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 62}}

===Nightclub shows and national acclaim===
After a year at the hungry i, Sahl began appearing at clubs throughout the country, including the The Black Orchid (nightclub) Black Orchid and Mister Kellys in Chicago, the Crescendo in Los Angeles, and the Village Vanguard and
the Blue Angel nightclub (New York) Blue Angel in New York City.<ref>Hashagen, Paul. Fire Department, City of New York, Turner Publishing (2002) p. 148</ref> Many of the clubs had never before had a stand-up comedian perform, which required Sahl to break in as a new kind of act. "I had to build up my own network of places to play," he says.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 68}}

{{quote box  align=right width=25em bgcolor = LightCyan quote=He was the best thing I ever saw. There was a need for revolution, everybody was ready for revolution, but some guy had to come along who could perform the revolution and be great. Mort was the one. He was the tip of the iceberg.

The Comedians, Grove Press (2015)</ref>{{rp 160}}}}

Numerous celebrities dropped by to see his shows after they heard about the "new phenomenon," referring to Sahls unique style of comedy. Woody Allen, who saw his show at the Blue Angel in 1954, commented that "he was suddenly this great genius that appeared who revolutionized the medium."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 68}} British comedy actor John Cleese became immediately interested in Sahls radical style of humor, and accorded to him the same level of respect that the Beatles once reserved for Elvis Presley.<ref name=Hopper/>

Television host Steve Allen, who originated the Tonight Starring Steve Allen Tonight Show, said he was "struck by how amateur he seemed," but added that the observation was not meant as a criticism, but as a "compliment". He noted that all the previous successful comics dressed formally, were glib and well-rehearsed, and were always in control of their audiences.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 63}} Allen said that Sahls "very un-show business manner was one of the things I liked when I first saw him work."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 63}}

Sahl dressed casually, with no tie and usually wearing his trademark V-neck campus-style sweater. His stage presence was seen as being "candid and cool, the antithesis of the slick comic," states theater critic Gerald Nachman (journalist) Gerald Nachman.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 50}} And although Sahl acquired a reputation for being an intellectual comedian, it was an image he disliked and disagreed with: "It was absurd. I was barely a C student," he said.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 67}} His naturalness on stage was partly due to his preferring improvisation over carefully rehearsed monologues. Sahl explained:

{{quote I never found you could write the act. You cant rehearse the audiences responses. You adjust to them every night. I come in with only an outline. Youve got to have a spirit of adventure. I follow my instincts and the audience is my jury.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 64}}}}

His casual style of stand-up, where he seemed to be one-on-one with his audience, influenced new comedians, including Lenny Bruce and Dick Gregory. Sahl was the least controversial, however, because he dressed and looked "collegiate" and focused on politics, while Bruce confronted sexual and language conventions and Gregory focused on the civil rights movement. After seeing Mort Sahl on stage, Woody Allen, whose writings were often about his personal life, decided to give it a try: "Id never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 545}}

Commenting about Sahls monologues, Nachman describes him as a "gifted narrator, so good at taking you along on his travels that you didnt quite realize until the show was over that you had been on a labyrinthine journey."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 64}} The speed with which Sahl gave his monologues was also notable. British film critic Penelope Gilliatt recalls how Sahls improvisation "goes on a breakneck stammering loop and you think it will never make the circle. It always does." For her it was like watching a circus act: "He freewheels a bike on a high wire tightrope with his brain racing and his hands off the handlebars."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 65}}

Sahls popularity "mushroomed like an Atomic cloud during the 50s," says filmmaker Robert B. Weide, adding, "Simply put, Mort Sahl reinvented stand-up comedy."<ref name=Weide/> Time magazine in 1960 published a cover story about him and his rise to fame, in which they described him as "the best of the New Comedians [and] the first notable American political satirist since Will Rogers."<ref name=Time/> Along with his nightclub performances, he appeared in some films and on television shows, including his network debut on The NBC Comedy Hour in May 1956.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoEUZMSTYjo "The Big Party" (1959, NBC)] (on YouTube.com); accessed February 14, 2015.</ref>

His audience had also widened to include not only students and a "hip" public, but now even noted politicians sought out his shows. Some became friends, such as presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, who asked him to prepare a bank of political jokes he could use at public functions.<ref name=Time/> Kennedy liked his style of political satire and what he described as Sahls "relentless pursuit of everybody."<ref name=Time/> Adlai Stevenson II Adlai Stevenson and Hubert Humphrey were fans, Humphrey stating that "whenever there is a political bloat, Mort sticks a pin in it."<ref name=Time/>

They valued the fact that he stayed current and took material from major newspapers and magazines. He kept his material fresh, wrote few notes, and entertained his audiences by presenting otherwise serious news with his brand of humor.<ref name=Time/> He was not fond of television news, however, which he blamed in 1960 for "spoon-feeding" the public, and was therefore responsible for the "corruption and ignorance that may sink this country."<ref name=Time/>

As a result of Sahls popularity, besides getting on the cover of Time, he also became the first comedian to make a record album, the first to do college concerts and was the first comedian to win a Grammy.<ref>[http://www.goldstar.com/events/san-francisco-ca/mort-sahl-and-dick-gregory "Legendary Comedians Mort Sahl and Dick Gregory at the Rrazz Room"], Goldstar</ref>

===Declining career from mid 1960s===
Following John F. Kennedy assassination Kennedys assassination in 1963, Sahls interest in who was responsible was so great that he became a Sheriff deputized member of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrisons team to investigate the assassination.<ref name=master/> As a result, Sahls comedy would often reflect his politics and included readings and commentary about the Warren Commission Report, of which he consistently disputed the accuracy.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL6bo3DxwOw&t=28m58s "Mors Sahl Live in New York City"], January 17, 1992</ref> He alienated much of his audience, was effectively blacklisting blacklisted and more of his planned shows were cancelled. His income dropped from $1 million to $19,000 by 1964.{{citation needed date=February 2016}} According to Nachman, the excessive focus on the Kennedy assassination details was Sahls undoing and wrecked his career. Sahl later admitted that "theres never been anything that had a stronger impact on my life than this issue," but added that he nonetheless "thought it was a wonderful quest."<ref name=Playboy/>

===Partial comeback in the 1970s to the present===
{{quote box  align=right width=30em bgcolor = Cornsilk quote=Mort Sahl has charted one of the most precipitous courses in American entertainment for last thirty years and has gone from celebrity to internal exile. There was no precedent for what he did. There were no prototypes. Hes a genuinely self-created man and a true existential in that sense. Once he passes from the scene, people will begin to lionize him and call him the great American and take to heart all the things he said. source= — Los Angeles Times, 1983<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 54}}}}

By the 1970s the rising tide of counterculture eventually fueled Sahls partial comeback as a veteran comedian, and he was included along with the new comedians breaking into the field, such as George Carlin, Lily Tomlin and Richard Pryor.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 89}} In the 1980s he headlined for Banduccis new clubs in San Francisco. In the late 1980s he was trying to write screenplays, besides doing sporadic shows around the country. In 1987 he had a successful multiweek run in Australia.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1987-03-21/entertainment/ca-4466_1_mort-sahl "L.A. To Get Another Taste Of The Biting Wit Of Mort Sahl"], Los Angeles Times, March 21, 1987.</ref>

In 1988 Sahl was back in New York and performed a one-man Off-Broadway show, Mort Sahls America, which, despite getting good reviews from critics was not a box office success. The New York Times stated, "History has returned Mort Sahl to the spotlight when he is most needed. His style has an intuitive spontaneity. His presence is tonic."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 92}} Robert Weide produced a biographical documentary, Mort Sahl: The Loyal Opposition, which ran  on PBS in 1989.<ref name=Weide>[http://duckprods.com/projects/mortsahl/index.html Mort Sahl: The Loyal Opposition], Whyaduck Productions, March 2, 2012.</ref>

However, the level of success he once had now eluded him. One Los Angeles Times critic wrote, "Sahl is a man with a country but not a stage."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 96}} A number of television specials gave him a venue to perform in front of live audiences. The Monitor Channel broadcast a series of eight shows called Mort Sahl Live beginning in November 1991.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnHUStTmm3A "Mort Sahl Live #1 Atlantic City 11/16/91"], The Monitor Channel, November 16, 1991</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3YlYRkR6I4 "Mort Sahl Live #2 Anaheim 2/21/91"], The Monitor Channel, December 12, 1991.</ref><!--Note: these are fair use videos uploaded by their producer, Bob Burns-->

From the 1990s on he has performed, but less often and mostly in theaters and college auditoriums.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1992-10-22/news/ol-977_1_mort-sahl "BARK AND BITE : For Nearly Four Decades, Mort Sahl Has Been the Voice of Social Satire; Dont Expect Him to Back Off Now"], Los Angeles Times, October 22, 1992</ref> When Woody Allen saw him perform in 2001 at one of his rare New York club appearances, Allen told him, "this is crazy—you should be working all the time."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 96}} Allen then called his manager Jack Rollins (producer) Jack Rollins: "Listen, this guy is hilarious. We gotta bring him to New York."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 96}} Sahl then did shows at Joes Pub in Manhattan to standing-room only audiences.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 97}}

Sahl is #40 on Comedy Centrals list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time, ranked between Billy Crystal and Jon Stewart.<ref>{{Cite episode   title = Comedy Centrals 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time   url = http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/100greatest/list.jhtml   access-date = 21 September 2016   series = Comedy Central Presents   network = Comedy Central   date = 17 April 2004   deadurl = yes   archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040605175309/http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/100greatest/list.jhtml   archivedate = 5 June 2004   df =  }}</ref> In 2003 he received the Fifth Annual Alan King (comedian) Alan King Award in American Jewish Humor from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture.<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/article/mort-sahl-13850 "Mort Sahl"], A.V.

In 2011, the Library of Congress placed his 1955 recording, At Sunset, on the National Recording Registry.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/essays/Mort%20Sahl%20At%20Sunset%20--%20laptop%20version5.pdf title=Mort Sahl at Sunset (1955) first=Daniel last=Blazek work=National Recording Registry publisher=Library of Congress year=2011}}</ref>

===Satire comedy style===
Sahls humor is based on current events, especially politics, which led Milton Berle to describe him as "one of the greatest political satirists of all time."<ref name=Hopper/> His trademark persona is to enter the stage with a newspaper in hand, casually dressed in a V-neck sweater. He would often recite some news stories combined with satire.<ref name=master>{{cite web url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/mort-sahl/about-mort-sahl/694 title=About Mort Sahl quote=In his trademark V-neck sweater, with the days newspaper tucked under his arm, Mort Sahl has satirized—and entertained—presidents from Eisenhower to Clinton. date=March 19, 2006 work=American Masters}}</ref> He was dubbed "Will Rogers with fangs" by Time magazine in 1960.<ref>{{cite journal  url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826502,00.html title=Comedians: Will Rogers with Fangs journal=Time (magazine) Time date=July 25, 1960 issn=0040-781X}}</ref>

He would discuss people or events almost as if he were reporting them for the first time, and would digress into related stories or his own experiences. TV executive Roger Ailes said he saw him read the paper one day and after a few hours Sahl got up onstage with an entire evenings worth of new material. "With no writers, he just did what he had seen in the afternoon paper. He was a genius."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 52}}

Sahls presentation of news commentary as a form of social satire created a wide assortment of celebrity and political fans, including Adlai Stevenson II Adlai Stevenson, Marlene Dietrich, S.J. Perelman, Saul Bellow and Leonard Bernstein. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. said his popularity was due to the publics "yearning for youth, irreverence, trenchancy, satire, [and] a clean break with the past."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 71}} And Steve Allen introduced him on one of his shows as being "the only real political philosopher we have in modern comedy."<ref>{{cite av media url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrSfyzuXS2M title=MORT SAHL DISCUSSES LENNY BRUCE date=23 October 2010 accessdate=February 6, 2016 via=YouTube}}</ref>

Combined with his improvisational skill, Sahls naturalness was also considered unique for a stage performer. Woody Allen notes that other comics were jealous of Sahls stage persona and did not understand how he could perform by simply talking to the audience.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 52}} Nachman states that the "mere idea of a stand-up comic talking about the real world was in itself revolutionary...[and] the comedians who followed him—Lenny Bruce, Woody Allen, Dick Gregory, Phyllis Diller, Shelley Berman, Jonathan Winters—were cast in a familiar nightclub mold."<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 51}}
