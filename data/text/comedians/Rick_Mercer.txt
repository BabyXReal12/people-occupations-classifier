==Career==

===Early work===
Mercer first came to national attention in 1990, when he created and presented his one-man stage show Show Me the Button, Ill Push It, or Charles Burchill Lynch Charles Lynch Must Die at the National Arts Centre National Arts Centres Atelier in Ottawa.<ref name=canenc>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/rick-mercer/ Rick Mercer] at The Canadian Encyclopedia.</ref> A pointed, satirical political commentary on Canadian life after Meech Lake Accord Meech Lake, Show Me the Button made Mercer a national star as he toured the show across Canada.<ref name=canenc /> In 1992, he created and performed his second stage show, Ive Killed Before, Ill Kill Again at the National Arts Centre National Arts Centres Studio Theatre, which also became a popular touring show.<ref name=canenc />

===This Hour has 22 Minutes===
In 1992 he began to work with former CODCO members Cathy Jones, Mary Walsh (actress) Mary Walsh and with fellow Newfoundlander Greg Thomey, to create a new television series for CBC Television which became This Hour Has 22 Minutes. In the first eight seasons of 22 Minutes, Mercer provided some of the shows signature moments, including an Internet petition (on the  22 Minutes website) to force Canadian Alliance leader Stockwell Day to Doris Day change his first name to Doris.

Mercers tightly scripted and performed two-minute "rants", in which he would speak directly to the camera about a current political issue, shot in a style similar to those Denis Leary used in MTV commercials, quickly became the shows signature segment. In 1998, he published a book, Streeters, which compiled many of his most famous 22 Minutes rants. It quickly became a national bestseller. In 2007 he published his second book, Rick Mercer Report: The Book.

In November 2010, Mercer contributed a rant he had previously recorded in 2007 on the subject of teen bullying in high schools to Dan Savages It Gets Better Project.<ref name="It gets better">{{cite web url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/rick-mercer-joins-it-gets-better-campaign-1.967052 title=Rick Mercer joins It Gets Better campaign publisher=CBC News date=November 2, 2010 accessdate=2015-09-16}}</ref>

====Talking to Americans====
{{main Talking to Americans}}
One of Mercers trademark comedy routines on 22 Minutes was Talking to Americans, in which he would travel to a major American city or institution and conduct on-the-street interviews with average Americans regarding Canadian politics, the weather, etc., often with hilarious results as the subjects ignorance about Canada was illustrated. One famous example saw Mercer asking Americans opinion on whether Canada should change its "20 Hour Clock" to the 24-hour one used by the United States.  He received approval from citizens and from the Governor of Iowa, Tom Vilsack. On another occasion he got the support of Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee in calling on Canadians to save the "National Igloo".

Mercer made international headlines in 2000 when he pulled a Talking to Americans stunt on then-presidential candidate George W. Bush. He successfully got Bush to answer questions about non-existent Canadian Prime Minister "Jean Poutine". Bush was not amused at the time, and thereafter refused to accept interviews from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation CBC.{{Citation needed date=October 2009}} However, he did make a joking reference to this incident during his visit to Canada in 2004. In the same US election campaign, Mercer asked Democratic candidate Al Gore to promise to visit the "Canadian capital city" of Toronto after his election. Gore did not question Mercers incorrect identification of the capital of Canada.

In 2001, Mercer co-produced a CBC special based on Talking to Americans, which attracted 2.7&nbsp;million Canadian viewers—the highest-rated television special in Canadian history. Later, the respected ABC News program Nightline (US news program) Nightline would devote a show to it.  This was his last major project related to 22 Minutes—at the end of the 2000–2001 season, he announced his departure from that show.  It was rumoured that he had decided to leave because of friction between Mercer and co-star Mary Walsh (actress) Mary Walsh{{Citation needed date=November 2008}}, although other reasons include focusing on his other television show, Made in Canada. Talking to Americans was nominated for a Gemini Award, but following the 9/11 attacks, Mercer declined the nomination.

===Made in Canada===
{{main Made in Canada}}
Mercer co-created the series Made in Canada, which ran for five seasons on CBC Television from 1998–2003. The show was a fast-paced situation comedy which self-reference self-referentially satirized the Canadian TV production industry, often drawing from details of its own production companies and including thinly veiled parodies of contemporary programs. It was syndicated abroad as The Industry and won several Gemini Awards (which were themselves satirized in subsequent episodes).

===The Rick Mercer Report===
{{main Rick Mercer Report}}
In 2003, Made in Canada ended its run as well, and Mercer began to work on a new CBC series, Rick Mercer Report Rick Mercers Monday Report. Similar in format to 22 Minutes and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, the show debuted in January 2004. Also in 2003, Mercer went to Afghanistan to visit the Canadian troops stationed there (See: Operation Athena), resulting in the television special Christmas in Kabul.

Despite reports of a long-standing feud Mercer invited Walsh to appear on Monday Report as a special guest to promote her own series Hatching, Matching and Dispatching.

At the end of its second season, Monday Report was the highest rated arts and entertainment show on the CBC. Mercer has had a whos who from the world of Canadian entertainment and politics appear as guests on his show. Ex-Prime Minister Paul Martin gave him a private tour of 24 Sussex Drive and former New Democratic Party of Canada New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent made snow angels with Mercer on Parliament Hill. Other prominent guests were New Democratic Party of Canada NDP leader Jack Layton (who was Mercers own MP); Conservative Party of Canada Conservative Party leader Stephen Harper (former Prime Minister); Green Party of Canada Green Party leader Elizabeth May; then-Conservative MP Belinda Stronach; Conservative MP Peter MacKay; former Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams (politician) Danny Williams; Olympic gold medallist Kyle Shewfelt; author Pierre Berton; recording artists Jann Arden, Bif Naked, Rush (band) Rush bassist Geddy Lee and drummer and lyricist Neil Peart, and Sarah McLachlan; publishing mogul Conrad Black; and former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. When Mercer hosted a relief benefit concert for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami at the Pengrowth Saddledome in Calgary, Alberta Calgary, musical guests Barenaked Ladies appeared in a segment Mercer shot backstage completely naked.

In 2005, the CBC moved Monday Report to Tuesday nights, which caused the shows name to be changed to The Rick Mercer Report. On his blog, Mercer wrote of the time slot shift that "we ended the season as the highest rated comedy show on the network. Clearly some drastic changes were needed."

In 2017, it was announced that the Rick Mercer Report will air for its 15th and final season which concluded on April 10, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://mediaincanada.com/2018/05/01/mercers-final-rant-gets-big-ratings/ title=Mercer’s final rant gets big ratings last= first= date= website= archive-url= archive-date= dead-url= access-date=}}</ref>
