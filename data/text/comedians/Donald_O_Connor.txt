==Career==
OConnor began performing in movies in 1937, making his debut aged 11 in Columbias It Cant Last Forever (1937).

===Paramount===
OConnor signed a contract at Paramount. He appeared in Men with Wings (1938) as Fred MacMurrays character as a boy, and in Sing You Sinners (film) Sing You Sinners (1938) as Bing Crosbys younger brother.

In 1940, when he had outgrown child roles, he returned to vaudeville.

===Universal===
In 1941, O’Connor signed with Universal Pictures, where he began by appearing in seven B-picture musicals in a row, starting with Whats Cookin? (1942) with The Andrews Sisters, Gloria Jean and Peggy Ryan.<ref>Zylstra, Freida. (July 25, 1950) "Chicago Born Donald OConnor Is a Veteran of Stage and Films at 25" Chicago Daily Tribune</ref>  He and Ryan were in Private Buckaroo (1942) and Give Out, Sisters (1942), both with the Andrews Sisters.

He, Ryan and Jean were in Get Hep to Love (1942) and When Johnny Comes Marching Home (film) When Johnny Comes Marching Home (1942). He made It Comes Up Love (1942) with Jean but without Ryan.

==="A" Films===
OConnor, Jean and Ryan were in Mister Big (1943 film) Mister Big (1943). Before this film was released, O’Connor’s popularity soared.  Universal added $50,000 in musical numbers to the film and promoted the "B" movie to "A" status.

OConnor and Ryan were in Top Man (film) Top Man (1943) and Chip Off the Old Block (1944). They both had cameos in Universals all-star Follow the Boys (1944).

On his 18th birthday in August 1943, during World War II OConnor was drafted into the United States Army.  Before he reported for induction on February 6, 1944, Universal already had four O’Connor films completed. They rushed production to complete four more by that date, all with Ryan: This Is the Life (1944 film) This Is the Life (1944), The Merry Monahans (1944), Bowery to Broadway (1945) and Patrick the Great (1945).

With a backlog of seven features, deferred openings kept O’Connor’s screen presence uninterrupted during the two years he was overseas.

===Return from War Service===
Upon his return, a merger in 1946 had reorganized the studio as Universal-International. The studio paired OConnor opposite their biggest female star, Deanna Durbin, in Something in the Wind (1947). He starred in Are You with It? (1948), Feudin, Fussin and A-Fightin (1949), and Yes Sir, Thats My Baby (film) Yes Sir, Thats My Baby (1949).

===Francis===
In 1949, he played the lead role in Francis (1950 film) Francis, the story of a soldier befriended by a talking mule. The film was a huge success. As a consequence, his musical career was constantly interrupted by production of one Francis film per year until 1955. OConnor later said the films "were fun to make. Actually, they were quite challenging. I had to play straight in order to convince the audience that the mule could talk."<ref>Donald OConnors musical Journey keeps him on road
Dale, Steve. Chicago Tribune (1963-Current file) [Chicago, Ill] 20 Dec 1985: n_a50.</ref>

OConnor followed the first Francis with comedies: Curtain Call at Cactus Creek (1950), The Milkman (1950), Double Crossbones (1951). He did Francis Goes to the Races (1951), another big hit.

===Singin in the Rain===
OConnor then received an offer to play Cosmo the piano player in Singin in the Rain (1952) at MGM. This earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy or Musical. The film featured his widely known rendition of "Make Em Laugh". OConnor said he smoked around 4 packs of cigarettes a day during filming.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.eviltwinltd.com/muppetlabs/oconnor/donald.htm title=Donald OConnor Web Site first=Teresa and Tracy Ann Murray, T n last=T publisher=}}</ref>

In 1952 OConnor signed a three-picture deal with Paramount.<ref>PARAMOUNT SIGNS DONALD OCONNOR: Actor Will Make 3 Pictures for Studio -- Betty Huttons Film May Be One of Them By THOMAS M. PRYOR Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES.. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 24 Jan 1952: 23.</ref> He went back to Universal for Francis Goes to West Point (1952) then returned to MGM for I Love Melvin (1953) a musical with Debbie Reynolds.

He supported Ethel Merman in Call Me Madam (film) Call Me Madam (1953) at 20th Century Fox, later saying the film contained his best dancing.<ref>{{cite web url=http://danceviewtimes.com/dvny/features/2003/oconnor.html title=Donald OConnor interview - Mindy Aloff publisher= accessdate=March 30, 2016}}</ref></blockquote>

After Francis Covers the Big Town (1953), Universal put OConnor in a musical in colour, Walking My Baby Back Home (film) Walking My Baby Back Home (1953). He did Francis Joins the WACS (1954) then played Tim Donahue in the 20th Century Fox musical Theres No Business Like Show Business (1954), which featured Irving Berlins music and also starred with Ethel Merman, Marilyn Monroe, Dan Dailey, Mitzi Gaynor and Johnnie Ray.

It was because of the Francis series that OConnor missed playing Bing Crosbys partner in White Christmas (film) White Christmas (1954). OConnor was unavailable because he contracted an illness transmitted by the mule, and was replaced in the film by Danny Kaye.

He starred in The Donald OConnor Show (1954–55) for one season. OConnor was a regular host of NBCs Colgate Comedy Hour.<ref name=severo/>

OConnor was reluctant to keep making Francis films but agreed to Francis in the Navy (1955).<ref>Donald OConnor Scheduled for Another Francis Film
Hopper, Hedda. Chicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963) [Chicago, Ill] 18 Oct 1954: b16.</ref> Arthur Lubin who directed the films later recalled that OConnor "got very difficult" to work with after a while. "He started drinking and I think he had problems at home. He started swearing at me and being late on set."<ref>{{cite book last=Davis first=Ronald L. page=183 title=Just Making Movies year=2005 publisher=University Press of Mississippi}}</ref>

OConnor and Crosby united on Anything Goes (1956 film) Anything Goes (1956) at Paramount. That studio also released The Buster Keaton Story (1957), in which OConnor had the title role. He hosted a color television special on NBC in 1957, one of the earliest color programs to be preserved on a color kinescope; an excerpt of the telecast was included in NBCs 50th anniversary special in 1976.

===1960s films===
OConnor teamed with Glenn Ford in Cry for Happy (1961) and played the title role in The Wonders of Aladdin (1961). He subsequently focused on theatre work then returned to films in the Sandra Dee comedy That Funny Feeling (1965).

In 1968, OConnor hosted a Television syndication syndicated talk show also called The Donald OConnor Show.<ref>Alex McNeil, Total Television, p. 231</ref> He suffered a heart attack in 1971.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.things-and-other-stuff.com/movies/profiles/donald-oconnor.html title=Donald OConnor by Susan M. Kelly publisher=}}</ref>

===1970s===
OConnor overcame alcoholism after being hospitalized for three months after collapsing in 1978.<ref name=severo/> His career had a boost when he hosted the Academy Awards, which earned him two Primetime Emmy nominations. He appeared as a gaslight-era entertainer in the 1981 film Ragtime (film) Ragtime, notable for similar encore performances by James Cagney and Pat OBrien (actor) Pat OBrien. It was his first feature film role in 16 years.

OConnor appeared in the short-lived Bring Back Birdie on Broadway theatre Broadway in 1981 and continued to make film and television appearances into the 1990s, including the Robin Williams film Toys (film) Toys as the president of a toy-making company. He had guest roles in 1996 in a pair of popular TV comedy series, The Nanny and Frasier.

In 1998, he received a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Palm Springs Walk of Stars Walk of Stars.<ref name="stars">{{cite web  title=Palm Spring Walk of Stars  url=http://www.palmsprings.com/stars/  publisher=PalmSprings.com  accessdate=2012-08-24}}</ref>

OConnors last feature film was the Jack Lemmon-Walter Matthau comedy Out to Sea, in which he played a dance host on a cruise ship. O’Connor was still making public appearances well into 2003.

The most distinctive characteristic of OConnors dancing style was its athleticism, for which he had few rivals.  Yet it was his boyish charm that audiences found most engaging, and which remained an appealing aspect of his personality throughout his career.  In his early Universal films, OConnor closely mimicked the smart alec, fast-talking personality of Mickey Rooney of rival MGM Studio.  For Singin in the Rain, however, MGM cultivated a much more sympathetic sidekick persona, and that remained OConnors signature image. {{Citation needed date=June 2013}}
