==Career==
{{BLP sources section date=January 2015}}

===Saturday Night Live===
In May 2000, Rudolph joined the cast of Saturday Night Live as a featured player for the final three episodes of the 1999–2000 season, after a stint as a member of The Groundlings improvisational theatre improv troupe, where she met future Saturday Night Live cast member Will Forte.<ref name=Itzkoff /> Rudolphs musical talents were frequently employed on Saturday Night Live. She sang as Beyoncé Knowles in the Prince (artist) Prince Show sketches, as the "Space Creature" in the Gays in Space sketches, except for the one on the season 31 episode hosted by Peter Sarsgaard, because it aired around the time Rudolph was on maternity leave. Friend, Will Forte, substituted for her during that episode. Her ability to change her looks and her command of many accents also led to her playing an unusually wide range of ethnicities on the show, often with only a change of wigs. As "Nuni Shoener," Rudolph, along with Fred Armisen, created a couple from an unspecified Scandinavian country, who have unplaceable accents and bewilderingly foreign manners. Rudolph was also able to play male characters such as Scott Joplin, Justin Guarini, and Mario Vazquez.

Her final episode as a cast member was on November 3, 2007, with host Brian Williams and musical guest Feist (singer) Feist, the last episode before the writers strike. She returned on October 25, 2008, in a featured guest appearance as Michelle Obama and sang a duet with Kenan Thompson about Amy Poehlers newborn. She then also appeared in the 2008 Christmas episode, where she reprised her role in the sketch Bronx Beat, with Amy Poehler. She also appeared in two sketches in the 2008–09 season finale with Will Ferrell. She appeared in a Weekend Update Thursday sketch during the fall 2009–10 season as Oprah Winfrey speaking on behalf of Chicagos bid for the 2016 Olympics. She also appeared on the show in May 2010 to perform in skits including "The Manuel Ortiz Show" with Betty White. She returned to Saturday Night Live for the season 36 premiere, hosted by Amy Poehler, performing the "Bronx Beat" sketch and that same season for episode 700, hosted by Tina Fey.<ref>{{Cite news  last =McGlynn first =Katla  title = SNL: Pregnant Tina Fey & Maya Rudolph Sing Duet About Doin It    work=Huffington Post www.huffingtonpost.com  date = May 8, 2011 url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/08/snl-pregnant-tina-fey-maya-rudolph-sing-duet_n_859117.html    accessdate =May 9, 2011}}</ref> On February 18, 2012 she returned to Saturday Night Live as a host for the first time and reprised her roles in sketches such as "Bronx Beat". She once again returned to SNL on December 19, 2015 for the Christmas episode hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler to reprise her role in the "Bronx Beat" sketch.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.people.com/article/amy-poehler-maya-rudolph-bronx-beat-snl-tina-fey title=Amy Poehler Reunites with Maya Rudolph in ‘Bronx Beat’ date=20 December 2015 publisher=}}</ref> She appeared once more on the Saturday Night Live (season 41) 41st season finale (hosted by Fred Armisen) as Dilma Rousseff on Weekend Update.
