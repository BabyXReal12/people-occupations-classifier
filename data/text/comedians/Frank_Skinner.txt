==Career==
After graduating, he spent three and a half years on unemployment benefit before finding work as a lecturer in English at Halesowen College.

In 1990, he co-wrote and starred in the comedy variety show Packet of Three (TV series) Packet Of Three on Channel 4 but continued to see his reputation as a stand-up grow. Before becoming a full-time performer in 1989, he suffered a bout of influenza in September 1986 that made him give up drinking, and he remains a high-profile recovering alcoholic.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14934650  location=London work=BBC News  title=Frank Skinner tells 5 live about his alcohol addiction date=15 September 2011  accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref>

The song reached #1 in the UK charts both times. In 2001, he released his autobiography Frank Skinner by Frank Skinner, which became a bestseller. The accompanying TV show, Frank Skinner on Frank Skinner, in which Skinner showed where he lived as a child and interviews with Skinner, his friends and family members, was recorded and shown on ITV (TV network) ITV in 2001.

In 1998, he took part in a documentary titled A Little Bit Of Elvis. He paid over pound sterling £11,000 at auction for a shirt which he believed was worn by Elvis Presley at his famous 1956 Tupelo concert. Skinner visited the US to find out if the shirt was the genuine article. After a slightly awkward conversation with Dave Hebler, Presleys bodyguard, it appeared the shirt did once belong to Presley, but it was not worn at the concert.  Skinner had been a fan of Elvis as a child and used to buy Elvis Monthly.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/elvis-presley-the-sun-years-by-frank-skinner-feature title=Elvis Presley: The Sun Years by Frank Skinner - Uncut date=2 March 2012 publisher=}}</ref>
