Stephen Glenn Martin (born August 14, 1945) is an American actor, comedian, writer, producer, playwright, author, and musician. Martin came to public notice in the 1960s as a writer for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, and later as a frequent guest on The Tonight Show. In the 1970s, Martin performed his offbeat, surreal humor absurdist comedy routines before packed houses on national tours. Since the 1980s, having branched away from comedy, Martin has become a successful actor, as well as an author, playwright, pianist, and banjo player, eventually earning him an Emmy, Grammy, and American Comedy Awards American Comedy awards, among other honors.

In 2004, Comedy Central<ref>{{cite web url=http://everything2.com/title/Comedy+Central%2527s+100+Greatest+Stand-Ups+of+all+Time title=Comedy Centrals 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of all Time publisher=}}</ref> ranked Martin at sixth place in a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics. He was awarded an Honorary Academy Award at the Academys 5th Annual Governors Awards in 2013.<ref>{{cite web title=Academy Unveils 2013 Governors Awards: Honorees Angelina Jolie, Angela Lansbury, Steve Martin, Piero Tosi url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/09/governors-awards-2013-winners-academy-oscars/ publisher=Deadline.com accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref>

While he has played banjo since an early age, and included music in his comedy routines from the beginning of his professional career, he has increasingly dedicated his career to music since the 2000s, acting less and spending much of his professional life playing banjo, recording, and touring with various bluegrass acts, including Earl Scruggs, with whom he won a Grammy for Best Country Instrumental Performance in 2002. He released his first solo music album, The Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo, in 2009, for which he won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album.

During World War II, in the United Kingdom, Martins father had appeared in a production of Our Town with Raymond Massey. Expressing his affection through gifts, like cars and bikes, Martins father was stern, and not emotionally open to his son.<ref Name="Mild"/> He was proud but critical, with Martin later recalling that in his teens his feelings for his father were mostly ones of hatred.<ref>{{cite web  last=Wills  first=Dominic  title= Steve Martin – Biography

Martins first job was at Disneyland, selling guidebooks on weekends and full-time during the schools summer break. That lasted for three years (1955–1958). During his free time, he frequented the Main Street, U.S.A.#Shopping Main Street Magic shop, where tricks were demonstrated to potential customers.<ref Name="Mild"/>  While working at Disneyland, he was captured in the background of the home movie that was made into the short-subject film Disneyland Dream, coincidentally becoming his first film appearance.  By 1960, he had mastered several of the tricks and illusions and took a paying job at the Magic shop in Fantasyland in August. There he perfected his talents for magic, juggling, and creating balloon animals in the manner of mentor Wally Boag,<ref name=Boag>Martin (2007) p18–19</ref> frequently performing for tips.<ref>Martin (2007) p 39</ref> In his authorized biography, close friend Morris Walker suggests that Martin could "be described most accurately as an agnostic [...] he rarely went to church and was never involved in organized religion of his own volition".<ref>Walker (1999) p40</ref>

===Comedy===
After high school graduation, Martin attended Santa Ana College, taking classes in drama and English poetry. In his free time, he teamed up with friend and Garden Grove High School classmate Kathy Westmoreland to participate in comedies and other productions at the Bird Cage Theatre. He joined a comedy troupe at Knotts Berry Farm.<ref Name="Mild"/> Later, he met budding actress Stormie Omartian Stormie Sherk, and they developed comedy routines and became romantically involved. Sherks influence caused Martin to apply to the California State University, Long Beach, for enrollment with a major in philosophy.<ref Name="Mild"/> Sherk enrolled at UCLA, about an hours drive north, and the distance eventually caused them to lead separate lives.<ref>Martin (2007) p 65</ref>

Inspired by his philosophy classes, Martin considered becoming a professor instead of an actor-comedian. His time at college changed his life. {{cquote It changed what I believe and what I think about everything. I majored in philosophy. Something about Non sequitur (absurdism) non-sequiturs appealed to me. In philosophy, I started studying logic, and they were talking about Causality cause and effect, and you start to realize, Hey, there is no cause and effect! There is no logic! There is no anything! Then it gets real easy to write this stuff because all you have to do is twist everything hard—you twist the climax (narrative) punch line, you twist the Non sequitur (absurdism) non-sequitur so hard away from the things that set it up.<ref name=RS>Fong-Torres, Ben (1982) "Steve Martin Sings: The Rolling Stone Interview". Rolling Stone February 18, 1982. Issue 363</ref>}} Martin recalls reading a treatise on comedy that led him to think: {{cquote What if there were no punch lines? What if there were no indicators? What if I created tension and never released it? What if I headed for a climax, but all I delivered was an anticlimax? What would the audience do with all that tension? Theoretically, it would have to come out sometime. But if I kept denying them the formality of a punch line, the audience would eventually pick their own place to laugh, essentially out of desperation.<ref>{{cite magazine  last=Martin  first=Steve  date=February 2008  title=Being Funny: How the path-breaking comedian got his act together  url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/being-funny-17061140 magazine=Smithsonian  access-date=August 14, 2010}}</ref>}} Martin periodically spoofed his philosophy studies in his 1970s stand-up act, comparing philosophy with studying geology. {{cquote If youre studying geology, which is all facts, as soon as you get out of school you forget it all, but philosophy you remember just enough to screw you up for the rest of your life.<ref>{{IMDb name 0000188}}</ref>}}

In 1967, Martin transferred to UCLA and switched his major to theater. While attending college, he appeared in an episode of The Dating Game. Martin began working local clubs at night, to mixed notices, and at twenty-one, he dropped out of college.<ref>[http://www.stevemartin.com/stop_the_presses/newsweek_78.php "SteveMartin.com   Stop the Presses"] {{webarchive  url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227054918/http://www.stevemartin.com/stop_the_presses/newsweek_78.php  date=February 27, 2009 }}</ref>

==Career==

===Early career: stand-up===

In 1967, his former girlfriend Nina Goldblatt, a dancer on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, helped Martin land a writing job with the show by submitting his work to head writer Mason Williams.<ref>Martin, (2007) p. 76</ref> Williams initially paid Martin out of his own pocket. Along with the other writers for the show, Martin won an Emmy Award<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/steve-martin title=Steve Martin work=Television Academy}}</ref> in 1969, aged 23.<ref name="Mild"/> He also wrote for John Denver (a neighbor of his in Aspen, Colorado now, at one point), The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, and The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour. Martins first TV appearance was on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in 1968. He says: {{cquote [I] appeared on The Virginia Graham Show, circa 1970. I looked grotesque. I had a hairdo like a helmet, which I blow-dried to a puffy bouffant, for reasons I no longer understand. I wore a frock coat and a silk shirt, and my delivery was mannered, slow and self-aware. I had absolutely no authority. After reviewing the show, I was depressed for a week.<ref name="Smith" />}} During these years his roommates included comedian Gary Mule Deer and singer/guitarist Michael Johnson (singer) Michael Johnson.<ref>Martin, (2007) p. 77</ref> Martin opened for groups such as The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (who returned the favor by appearing in his 1980 television special All Commercials), The Carpenters, and Toto (band) Toto. He appeared at San Franciscos The Boarding House (nightclub) The Boarding House, among other venues. He continued to write, earning an Emmy nomination for his work on Dick Van Dyke Van Dyke and Company in 1976.

Radner died of ovarian cancer on May 20, 1989; a visibly shaken Martin hosted SNL that night and featured footage of himself and Radner together in a 1978 sketch.

In the 1970s, his TV appearances led to the release of comedy albums that went Music recording sales certification platinum.<ref name="Mild"/> The track "Excuse Me" on his first album, Lets Get Small (1977), helped establish a national catch phrase.<ref name="Mild"/> His next album, A Wild and Crazy Guy (1978), was an even bigger success, reaching the No. 2 spot on the U.S. sales chart, selling over a million copies. "Just a wild and crazy guy" became another of Martins known catch phrases.<ref name="Mild"/> The album featured a character based on a series of Saturday Night Live sketches where Martin and Dan Aykroyd played the Festrunk Brothers; Yortuk and Georgi (respectively) were bumbling Czechoslovak would-be playboys. The album ends with the song "King Tut (song) King Tut", sung and written by Martin and backed by the "Toot Uncommons", members of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.

Both albums won Grammys for Best Comedy Recording in 1977 and 1978, respectively. Martin performed "King Tut" on the edition of April 22, 1978, of SNL.

Decades later, in 2012, The A.V. Club described Martins unique style and its impact on audiences:
{{cquote [Martin was] both a consummate entertainer and a glib, knowing parody of a consummate entertainer. He was at once a hammy populist with an uncanny, unprecedented feel for the tastes of a mass audience and a sly intellectual whose goofy shtick cunningly deconstructed stand-up comedy.<ref>{{cite web last=Rabin first=Nathan title=Steve Martin: The Television Stuff url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/steve-martin-the-television-stuff,88419/ publisher=Onion Inc. accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>}}

On his comedy albums, Martins stand-up is self-referential and sometimes self-mocking. It mixes philosophical riffs with sudden spurts of "happy feet", banjo playing with balloon depictions of concepts like venereal disease, and the "controversial" kitten juggling (he is a master juggler; the "kittens" were stuffed animals). His style is off-kilter and ironic and sometimes pokes fun at stand-up comedy traditions, such as Martin opening his act (from A Wild and Crazy Guy) by saying: {{cquote I think theres nothing better for a person to come up and do the same thing over and over for two weeks. This is what I enjoy, so Im going to do the same thing over and over and over [...] Im going to do the same joke over and over in the same show, itll be like a new thing.}}  Or: "Hello, Im Steve Martin, and Ill be out here in a minute."<ref name="Frum"/><ref>[http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/40968/"Rationalist of the Absurd: Steve Martins extraordinarily calculated comedy".New York Books November 18, 2007].

The riff took on a life of its own. There is a Gern Blanston website, and for a time a rock band took the moniker as their name.<ref>Martin (2007) p176–77</ref>

With this kind of outstanding success, Martins show soon required full sized stadiums for the audiences he was drawing. Concerned about his visibility in venues on such a scale, Martin began to wear a distinctive three piece suit three piece white suit that became a trademark for his act.<ref>{{cite news last1=OReilly first1=Terry title=How A Wardrobe Change Transformed Steve Martins Career url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/how-a-wardrobe-change-transformed-steve-martin-s-career-1.4525782 accessdate=18 February 2018 work=Under the Influence agency=Pirate Radio publisher=CBC Radio One date=8 February 2018}}</ref>

Martin stopped doing stand-up comedy in 1981 to concentrate on movies and did not return for 35 years.<ref name="Mild"/> About this decision, he states: {{cquote My act was conceptual. Once the concept was stated, and everybody understood it, it was done. [...] It was about coming to the end of the road. There was no way to live on in that persona.

===Acting career===

By the end of the 1970s, Martin had acquired the kind of following normally reserved for rock stars, with his tour appearances typically occurring at sold-out arenas filled with tens of thousands of screaming fans. But unknown to his audience, stand-up comedy was "just an accident" for him; his real goal was to get into film.<ref name=RS/>

Martin had a small role in the 1972 film Another Nice Mess. His first substantial film appearance was in a short film short titled The Absent-Minded Waiter (1977). The seven-minute-long film, also featuring Buck Henry and Teri Garr, was written by and starred Martin.

Stanley Kubrick met with him to discuss the possibility of Martin starring in a screwball comedy version of Dream Story Traumnovelle (Kubrick later changed his approach to the material, the result of which was 1999s Eyes Wide Shut). Martin was executive producer for Domestic Life, a prime-time television series starring friend Martin Mull, and a late-night series called Twilight Theater. It emboldened Martin to try his hand at his first serious film, Pennies from Heaven (1981 film) Pennies from Heaven, based on the Pennies from Heaven (TV series) 1978 BBC serial by Dennis Potter. He was anxious to perform in the movie because of his desire to avoid being typecasting (acting) typecast. To prepare for that film, Martin took acting lessons from director Herbert Ross and spent months learning how to tap dance. The film was a financial failure; Martins comment at the time was "I dont know what to blame, other than its me and not a comedy."<ref>American film Volume 7. 1981. American Film Institute, Arthur M. Sackler Foundation</ref>

Martin was in three more Reiner-directed comedies after The Jerk: Dead Men Dont Wear Plaid in 1982, The Man with Two Brains in 1983 and All of Me (1984 film) All of Me in 1984, his most critically acclaimed performance up to that point.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1000640-all_of_me/  title=All of Me publisher=Rotten Tomatoes accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E05EEDA143AF932A1575AC0A962948260 "Steve Martin In All Of Me"].

===Music===
Martin first picked up the banjo when he was around 17 years of age. Martin has stated in several interviews and in his memoir, Born Standing Up, that he used to take 33 rpm Bluegrass music bluegrass records and slow them down to 16 rpm and tune his banjo down, so the notes would sound the same. Martin was able to pick out each note and perfect his playing.

Martin learned how to play the banjo with help from John McEuen, who later joined the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. McEuens brother later managed Martin as well as the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Martin did his stand-up routine opening for the band in the early 1970s. He had the band play on his hit song "King Tut", being credited as "The Toot Uncommons" (as in Tutankhamun).

The banjo was a staple of Martins 1970s stand-up career, and he periodically poked fun at his love for the instrument.<ref Name="Smith"/> On the Comedy Is Not Pretty! album, he included an all-instrumental jam, titled "Drop Thumb Medley", and played the track on his 1979 concert tour. His final comedy album, The Steve Martin Brothers (1981), featured one side of Martins typical stand-up material, with the other side featuring live performances of Steve playing banjo with a bluegrass band.

Investigators at Berlins state criminal police office (LKA) think that Martin was a victim of German art forger Wolfgang Beltracchi. In July 2004, Martin purchased what he believed to be a 1915 work by the German-Dutch painter Heinrich Campendonk, Landschaft mit Pferden (Landscape With Horses) from a Paris gallery for what should have been a bargain price of around €700,000 (around $850,000 at the time). Before the purchase, an expert authenticated the work and identified the painters signature on a label attached to the back. Fifteen months later, the painting was sold at auction to a Swiss businesswoman for €500,000 – a loss of €200,000. Police believe the fake Campendonk originated from an invented art collection devised by a group of German swindlers caught in 2010. Skillfully forged paintings from this group were sold to French galleries like the one where Martin bought the forgery.<ref>{{cite web
