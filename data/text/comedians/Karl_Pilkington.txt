==Career==

===Early work===
Pilkington moved to London from Manchester to work with XFM London XFM as a producer.  While there, he unintentionally caused Gail Porter to leave the station in tears after only one show; he criticised her performance, which Pilkington says was an attempt to encourage improvement.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.absoluteradio.co.uk/player/Christian-O-Connell-Breakfast-Show/8302/Karl-Pilkington--Ricky-Gervais-and-Stephen-Merchant-Conned-Me-Into-TV-Show.html  title=Karl Pilkington: Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant Conned Me Into TV Show - On The Christian OConnell Breakfast Show - Video  publisher=Absolute Radio  date=  accessdate=26 August 2013  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002183231/http://www.absoluteradio.co.uk/player/Christian-O-Connell-Breakfast-Show/8302/Karl-Pilkington--Ricky-Gervais-and-Stephen-Merchant-Conned-Me-Into-TV-Show.html  archivedate= 2 October 2013  df= }}</ref> After several years he began work on The Ricky Gervais Show. Initially, Pilkington was solely the programmes producer. As Gervais and Merchant began to invite him to make the odd comment, Pilkingtons persona came to light and his popularity increased. Pilkington was eventually included as a main element of the broadcasts, with large amounts of airtime often given over to his thoughts on various subjects, or various childhood stories. In December 2005, Pilkington stood in for two BBC 6 Music shows for Nemone, and co-presented the shows with Russell Brand.

===Celebrity===
Pilkingtons presence on The Ricky Gervais Show podcasts significantly increased his popularity. He has often been mentioned in interviews given by Gervais, and is often the butt of Gervais practical jokes. After saying "I could eat a knob at night" on the podcast (in relation to Im a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! Im a Celebrity contestants Im a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)#Bushtucker trial eating a kangaroo penis), Gervais encouraged his listeners to sample the sound bite and mix it into dance music. The phrase spawned several dance music mixes, T-shirts, and other merchandise. Many of Pilkingtons quotes have since gained publicity, particularly on the Internet. Reuters, commenting on this issue, described Pilkington as a "phenomenon" who had made "Internet history".<ref>{{cite web date=August 2004  url=http://www.rickygervais.com/karlisacult.php  title=Ricky Gervais... Obviously  publisher=Rickygervais.com  accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref>

On 23 November 2010, while appearing live on Richard Bacon (TV presenter) Richard Bacons BBC Radio 5 Live Radio 5 Live afternoon show, Gervais surprised Pilkington with an on-air phone call. This led to a conversation where Pilkington, who claimed to have been interrupted while grouting his kitchen, said he had not yet been paid for his work on An Idiot Abroad and concluded the interview with an off-the-cuff link into the hourly news.<ref>{{cite news  url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11815230   work=BBC News   title=Ricky Gervais makes a surprise call to Karl Pilkington   date=22 November 2010}}</ref> Pilkington has worked independently of Gervais and Merchant on several projects. He appeared as a guest on the shows Flipside TV and The Culture Show,<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.rlslog.net/the-culture-show-s08e03-ws-pdtv-xvid-remax/  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204012546/http://www.rlslog.net/the-culture-show-s08e03-ws-pdtv-xvid-remax/  dead-url=yes  archive-date=4 February 2008  title=Releaselog &#124; RLSLOG.net » The Culture Show S08E03 WS PDTV XviD-REMAX  publisher=RLSLOG.net  date=  accessdate=18 March 2010 }}</ref> and appeared in several short films as part of the Channel 4 project 3 Minute Wonders.

Merchant and Gervais have repeatedly denied claims that Pilkingtons comic persona is their creation. In an on-air response to similar claims made by Chris Campling during a broadcast on XFM, Merchant stated that he would be "ashamed" if the radio show was scripted, and added that "I would not have squandered a character that good on this poxy radio station".<ref>Pilkington, K. (Producer) & Merchant, S., Gervais, R. (Presenters). (June 2005)</ref> Gervais concurred, pointing out that writing a single series worth of six half-hour episodes of shows such as The Office and Extras took the two of them up to a year. An interviewer for The Daily Telegraph concluded that Pilkingtons persona is genuine.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3655386/The-idiot-philosopher.html  title=The idiot philosopher publisher= The Daily Telegraph  accessdate=28 May 2012   date=17 September 2006}}</ref>
