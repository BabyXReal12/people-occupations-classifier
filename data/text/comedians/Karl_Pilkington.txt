==Career==

===Early work===
Pilkington moved to London from Manchester to work with XFM London XFM as a producer.  While there, he unintentionally caused Gail Porter to leave the station in tears after only one show; he criticised her performance, which Pilkington says was an attempt to encourage improvement.
After several years he began work on The Ricky Gervais Show. Initially, Pilkington was solely the programmes producer. As Gervais and Merchant began to invite him to make the odd comment, Pilkingtons persona came to light and his popularity increased. Pilkington was eventually included as a main element of the broadcasts, with large amounts of airtime often given over to his thoughts on various subjects, or various childhood stories. In December 2005, Pilkington stood in for two BBC 6 Music shows for Nemone, and co-presented the shows with Russell Brand.

===Celebrity===
Pilkingtons presence on The Ricky Gervais Show podcasts significantly increased his popularity. He has often been mentioned in interviews given by Gervais, and is often the butt of Gervais practical jokes. After saying "I could eat a knob at night" on the podcast (in relation to Im a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! Im a Celebrity contestants Im a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)#Bushtucker trial eating a kangaroo penis), Gervais encouraged his listeners to sample the sound bite and mix it into dance music. The phrase spawned several dance music mixes, T-shirts, and other merchandise. Many of Pilkingtons quotes have since gained publicity, particularly on the Internet. Reuters, commenting on this issue, described Pilkington as a "phenomenon" who had made "Internet history".
On 23 November 2010, while appearing live on Richard Bacon (TV presenter) Richard Bacons BBC Radio 5 Live Radio 5 Live afternoon show, Gervais surprised Pilkington with an on-air phone call. This led to a conversation where Pilkington, who claimed to have been interrupted while grouting his kitchen, said he had not yet been paid for his work on An Idiot Abroad and concluded the interview with an off-the-cuff link into the hourly news.
Pilkington has worked independently of Gervais and Merchant on several projects. He appeared as a guest on the shows Flipside TV and The Culture Show,
and appeared in several short films as part of the Channel 4 project 3 Minute Wonders.

Merchant and Gervais have repeatedly denied claims that Pilkingtons comic persona is their creation. In an on-air response to similar claims made by Chris Campling during a broadcast on XFM, Merchant stated that he would be "ashamed" if the radio show was scripted, and added that "I would not have squandered a character that good on this poxy radio station".
Gervais concurred, pointing out that writing a single series worth of six half-hour episodes of shows such as The Office and Extras took the two of them up to a year. An interviewer for The Daily Telegraph concluded that Pilkingtons persona is genuine.
===Television and DVD===
Pilkington appeared in an interview on Ricky Gervaiss live stand-up comedy DVD, Politics (comedy) Politics. The DVD of Gervaiss film The Invention of Lying contains a special feature called Meet Karl Pilkington
which documents his participation in the movie as a non-speaking caveman in another special feature, The Dawn of Lying.
{{unreliable source? date=September 2015}} He was given a small role in the final episode of Extras (TV series) Extras.

He wrote a book to accompany the series.
Following the success of the first series, Pilkington starred in the second series subtitled The Bucket List, which debuted on 23 September 2011 on Sky 1. The premise of the series involves Pilkington trying to experience "ultimate things to do before you die" except that the list of activities is not entirely of his choosing.
