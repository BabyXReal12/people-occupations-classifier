===1976–1981: WRNW, WCCC, and WWWW===
In his search for radio work following his graduation, Stern declined an offer to work evenings at WXPK WRNW, a progressive rock station in Briarcliff Manor, New York Briarcliff Manor, New York.{{sfn Stern Sloman 1993 p=118}} He stopped and was unsure of his talent and questioned his future as a professional in the industry, writing "I freaked out. I got real nervous that I wasnt good enough".{{sfn Stern Sloman 1993 p=118}} Stern accepted a marketing role at Benton & Bowles, a New York advertising agency, which he soon "quit without giving notice" in favor of a position in the creative department. He lasted three hours before he was fired "because their personnel department realized that I was the guy who just quit."{{sfn Stern Sloman 1993 p=118}} Stern then worked in Queens as a radio salesman selling advertising time without considerable success. He wrote, "All of a sudden ... I realized I had turned down a job in radio".

In 1979, Stern spotted an advertisement in Radio & Records for a "wild, fun morning guy" at rock station WCCC (FM) WCCC in Hartford, Connecticut Hartford, Connecticut.{{sfn Stern Sloman 1993 p=125}} He used some morning air time to assemble an aircheck with more outrageous bits, including Robert Klein and Cheech and Chong records with added flatulence routines and one-liners.{{sfn Colford 1997 p=45}} Stern was hired for the same salary but worked a more intense schedule. After four hours on the air, he voiced and produced commercials for another four. On Saturdays, following a six-hour show, he did production work for the next three. He also completed duties as the stations public affairs director and hosted a Sunday morning talk show which he favored above playing records{{sfn Stern Sloman 1993 pp=126–127}} as it "represented what I wanted to do on the radio more than anything. Take the average guy and dissect what he does".{{sfn Luerssen 2009 p=157}} In the summer of the 1979 energy crisis, Stern urged listeners to a two-day boycott of Shell Oil Company, a stunt which attracted media attention.{{sfn Colford 1997 p=48}} It was at WCCC where Stern first met Fred Norris, the overnight disc jockey, who went on to become Sterns writer and producer since 1981.{{sfn Colford 1997 p=74}} Stern left WCCC in early 1980 after he was denied a "lousy, stinking twenty-five-dollar-a-week raise."{{sfn Stern Sloman 1993 p=128}} At the same time, local rival station WHCN had assembled tapes and press clippings of Stern and forwarded them to Burkhart/Abrams, a radio consulting firm, to get Stern out of the Hartford media market market as a rise in his ratings increased his threat to the stations numbers.{{sfn Colford 1997 p=51}} The tapes were received by Dwight Douglas, a consultant at Burkhart/Abrams, who offered Stern work in Columbus, Ohio Columbus, Ohio, but Stern declined.{{sfn Stern Sloman 1993 p=128}}

In his search for new work, Stern found an advertised position in Radio & Records for a morning host at WDTW-FM WWWW, a struggling rock station in Detroit, Michigan. His aircheck was well received by management who made an offer,{{sfn Colford 1997 p=52}} but Douglas advised Stern against the move and suggested to wait for an offer from a better station.

===1981–1985: WWDC and WNBC ===
Douglas found Sterns next job, hosting mornings at album-oriented rock station WWDC (FM) WWDC in Washington, D.C. Stern was cautious about the offer at first as the general manager "was not really aware of what I did," but accepted the offer and started on March 2, 1981.{{sfn Colford 1997 p=62, 67}} During his time relocating from Detroit, Stern spent several weeks planning out a new show, determined to become more successful as the station presented a good chance for him to work in New York City, his career goal. He was determined to "kill my competition. I was going to say whatever the fuck I was going to say ... The first step was to put my team together". He sought a co-host with a sense of humor to riff with on news and current events.{{sfn Stern Sloman 1993 p=135}} The station then paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a former nurse in the United States Air Force air force and news reporter at WJZ (AM) WFBR in Baltimore.{{sfn Colford 1997 p=63}} Quivers was sent a tape of Stern interviewing a prostitute on the air, and accepted the job without meeting him. She assumed she "would come in and do the news ... but it wasnt that way".{{sfn Colford 1997 p=68}} Despite several issues management had over content, which led to the installation of a Broadcast delay seven-second delay to censor questionable moments,<ref name=washpost1982>{{Cite web url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1982/03/13/howard-stern-to-leave-dc/7eef442c-94a3-4acf-9040-5ed08f0e729e/ title=Howard Stern To Leave D.C. date=March 13, 1982 first=Joe last=Brown work=The Washington Post accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref> Stern "kept chipping away at managements archaic approach and we began to assemble the program I had envisioned," which included the addition of Norris as his writer and producer. In one incident, Stern revealed his wifes miscarriage on the air. In January 1982, Stern had the second highest rated morning show in the city.{{sfn Stern Sloman 1993 pp=138–140}}

Impressed with his rapid rise in the ratings, WWDC management offered Stern an initial one-year extension to his contract, but Stern wished for a more long-term deal.{{sfn Colford 1997 p=78}} At the same time, he was offered a five-year deal worth $1 million to work afternoons at WNBC (AM) WNBC in New York City, then an Adult contemporary music adult contemporary station, after radio manager Jerry Nachman became a fan of Sterns and suggested his name to the station.<ref name=washpost1982/> Stern signed with WNBC in March 1982, four months before his contract with WWDC was to expire.{{sfn Colford 1997 p=81}} His relationship with station management declined there on, and repeatedly criticized them and other deejays on the air, including an incident whereby he revealed the managers salary.{{sfn Colford 1997 p=87}} The situation culminated on June 25, 1982, when Stern was terminated from the station. Towards the end of his stay, Stern had more than tripled his ratings since he began and Washingtonian (magazine) The Washingtonian named him the citys best disc jockey.{{sfn Colford 1997 pp=87–89}} In his last few months, Stern secured a $35,000 advance deal with Wren Records to produce a comedy album of song parodies with Norris titled Howard Stern videography and discography 50 Ways to Rank Your Mother, released in 1982. It was reissued in November 1994 as Unclean Beaver.{{sfn Colford 1997 p=82}} It was often believed that Stern was in fact suspended over a controversial bit regarding the January 1982 crash of Air Florida Flight 90 that made people believe he called the airline and asked for prices to the 14th Street Bridges 14th Street bridge, the site of the crash, and if it would be a "regular stop." But Stern said it was false, claiming "no one ever complained about it."
