Lyda and Roberts Kiev-born younger sister, Mary Pecjak, was briefly an actress, known as Manya Roberti (1908-1983),
who later disappeared from show business.
Manya Pecjak (aka Roberti) married an American, Irvin Russell Deibert (1899-1937), on November 8, 1924, aged 16, in Shanghai Shanghai, China; the couple had a daughter, Lorraine Roberta, later Mrs. Bass (1926–1996). They divorced {{When date=October 2017}}, and, in 1933, Manya Deibert later remarried, to Louis Schneider. It is not known if any children resulted from this union.
Lyda made her Broadway theatre Broadway debut in You Said It in 1931, and with its success became an overnight sensation. During her run with the show, she was nicknamed "Broadways preferred Polish blonde". Historian Edward Jablonski found that "much of her appeal to the audiences at the time was due to her Polish accent" and cited instances where her pronunciation of certain consonants would "stir audiences to gales of laughter."
She also appeared in the short-lived Gershwin musical Pardon My English in 1933. She moved to Hollywood and during the 1930s played in a string of films. Her sexy but playful characterisations, along with the unusual accent she had acquired during her years in Europe and Asia, made her popular with audiences.

She starred in Edward F. Clines comedy Million Dollar Legs (1932 film) Million Dollar Legs (1932) as "Mata Machree, The Woman No Man Can Resist", a Mata Hari-based spy character who is hired to undermine the President of Klopstokia (played by W. C. Fields) in his efforts to secure money for his destitute country. Her plan is to seduce the athletes that Klopstokia is sending to the Olympic Games, and thereby prevent them from medaling. Highlights of the film include Mata Machrees steamy rendition of "When I Get Hot in Klopstokia", and the dance she performs to inspire Fieldss opponent in the weightlifting competition.{{citation needed date=October 2017}}
