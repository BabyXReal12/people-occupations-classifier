Born in Warsaw, then part of Imperial Russia, Lyda Roberti was the daughter of a German father (surnamed Pecjak), a professional clown, {{citation needed date=September 2017}} and a Polish mother. As a child she performed in the circus as a trapeze artist, and was a vaudeville singer.

As her family toured Europe and Asia, Robertis mother left her husband. To escape the upheaval in Russia after the Communist revolution in 1917, they settled in Shanghai, China, where Lyda earned money singing. She had an elder brother, also born in Poland, [http://search.ancestrylibrary.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?_phsrc=fPn9&_phstart=successSource&usePUBJs=true&gss=angs-g&new=1&rank=1&gsfn=Manya%20&gsfn_x=0&gsln=Schneider&gsln_x=0&msbdy_x=1&msbdp=2&msbdy=1908&catbucket=rstp&MSAV=0&uidh=57k&pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&h=55319678&recoff=12%2013&dbid=3693&indiv=1&ml_rpos=2 Robert Pecjak (later Robert Roberti; 1905-1996)].

Lyda made her Broadway theatre Broadway debut in You Said It in 1931, and with its success became an overnight sensation. During her run with the show, she was nicknamed "Broadways preferred Polish blonde". Historian Edward Jablonski found that "much of her appeal to the audiences at the time was due to her Polish accent" and cited instances where her pronunciation of certain consonants would "stir audiences to gales of laughter."<ref name="Jablonski1998">{{cite book author=Edward Jablonski title=Harold Arlen: Rhythm, Rainbows, and Blues url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsgCHeS69q8C&pg=PA63 date=September 1, 1998 publisher=UPNE isbn=978-1-55553-366-3 pages=63–}}</ref> She also appeared in the short-lived Gershwin musical Pardon My English in 1933. She moved to Hollywood and during the 1930s played in a string of films. Her sexy but playful characterisations, along with the unusual accent she had acquired during her years in Europe and Asia, made her popular with audiences.

She starred in Edward F. Clines comedy Million Dollar Legs (1932 film) Million Dollar Legs (1932) as "Mata Machree, The Woman No Man Can Resist", a Mata Hari-based spy character who is hired to undermine the President of Klopstokia (played by W. C. Fields) in his efforts to secure money for his destitute country. Her plan is to seduce the athletes that Klopstokia is sending to the Olympic Games, and thereby prevent them from medaling. Highlights of the film include Mata Machrees steamy rendition of "When I Get Hot in Klopstokia", and the dance she performs to inspire Fieldss opponent in the weightlifting competition.{{citation needed date=October 2017}}

Roberti had replaced Thelma Todd in a couple of films after Todds death, but Robertis own health was failing due to heart disease.
