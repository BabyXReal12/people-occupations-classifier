Terrence Vance Gilliam ({{IPAc-en ˈ ɡ ɪ l i ə m}}; born 22 November 1940)<ref name="Gilliam">{{cite web   url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/7fc7a75a-fd8e-4c58-9072-7fa1873ceb3a   title=BBC Music biography   publisher=BBC Music   accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref> is an American-born British screenwriter, film director, animator, actor, comedian and former member of the Monty Python comedy troupe.

Gilliam has directed 12 feature films, including Time Bandits (1981), Brazil (1985 film) Brazil (1985), The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), The Fisher King (1991), 12 Monkeys (1995), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film) Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), The Brothers Grimm (film) The Brothers Grimm (2005), Tideland (film) Tideland (2005), and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009). The only "Python" not born in Britain, he became a naturalised British subject in 1968 and formally Renunciation of United States citizenship renounced his American citizenship in 2006.

Gilliam was born in Minnesota, but spent his high school and college years in Los Angeles. He started his career as an animator and strip cartoonist. He joined Monty Python as the animator of their works, but eventually became a full member and was given acting roles. He became a feature film director in the 1970s. Most of his films explore the theme of imagination and its importance to life, express his opposition to bureaucracy and authoritarianism, and feature characters facing dark or paranoid situations. His own scripts feature black comedy and tragicomedy elements, combined with Plot twist#Surprise ending surprise endings.

==Early life==
Gilliam was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Beatrice (née Vance) and James Hall Gilliam. His father was a travelling salesman for Folgers before becoming a carpenter. Soon after, they moved to nearby Medicine Lake, Minnesota.<ref>{{cite book title=The Pythons: Autobiography by the Pythons year=2005 publisher=St. Martins Griffin location=New York isbn=978-0312311452}}</ref>

The family moved to the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Panorama City, Los Angeles Panorama City in 1952. Gilliam attended Birmingham High School, where he was the president of his class and senior prom king. He was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" and achieved straight As. During high school, he began to avidly read Mad (magazine) Mad magazine, then edited by Harvey Kurtzman, which would later influence Gilliams work.<ref>{{cite book last1=Gilliam first1=Terry last2=Sterritt first2=David  authorlink2=David Sterritt last3=Rhodes first3=Lucille title=Terry Gilliam: Interviews url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8eDE0hce0kEC&pg=PA65 accessdate=7 October 2010 date=April 2004 publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi isbn=978-1-57806-624-7 page=67 quote=Mad (magazine) Mad comics inspired everything we ever did. (p. 67)}}</ref>

Gilliam graduated from Occidental College in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science.<ref name="OXY">{{cite web  url=https://www.oxy.edu/news/terry-gilliam-62-honored-british-film-academy  title=Terry Gilliam 62 Honored by British Film Academy  work=Oxy  publisher=Occidental College  date=9 February 2009}}</ref>

Gilliam told Salman Rushdie about defining experiences in the 1960s that, he said, set the foundations for his views on the world:

{{quote I became terrified that I was going to be a full-time, bomb-throwing terrorist if I stayed [in the U.S.] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was 66–67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.&nbsp;... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.&nbsp;... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night Id be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guys foolish daughter. And I said, "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop.&nbsp;...

And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, Ive got to get out of here—Im a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. Thats why so much of the U.S. is still standing.<ref name="rushdie">[http://www.believermag.com/issues/200303/?read=interview_gilliam "Salman Rushdie Talks with Terry Gilliam"]. The Believer.

==Career==

===Animation===
Gilliam began his career as an animator and Cartoonist strip cartoonist. One of his early Photonovel photographic strips for Help! (magazine) Help! magazine featured future Python cast member John Cleese.<ref name="lambiek.net">{{cite web url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/gilliam_tery.htm title=Terry Gilliam website=lambiek.net}}</ref> When Help! folded, Gilliam went to Europe, jokingly announcing in the very last issue that he was "being transferred to the European branch" of the magazine,<ref name="rushdie" /> which, of course, did not exist. Moving to England, he animated sequences for the childrens series Do Not Adjust Your Set, which also featured Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin.<ref name="lambiek.net"/>

===Monty Python===
Gilliam was a part of Monty Pythons Flying Circus from its outset, credited at first as an animator (his name was listed separately after the other five in the closing credits) and later as a full member. His cartoons linked the shows sketches together and defined the groups visual language in other media (such as LP and book covers and the title sequences of their films). His animations mix his own art, characterised by soft gradients and odd, bulbous shapes, with backgrounds and moving cutouts from antique photographs, mostly from the Victorian era.

In 1978, Gilliam published Animations of Mortality, an illustrated, tongue-in-cheek, semi-autobiographical how-to guide to his animation techniques and the visual language in them.<ref>[http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/tgbooks.htm Dreams: Terry Gilliam Books]. Dreams: The Terry Gilliam Fanzine.</ref> Roughly 15 years later, between the release of the CD-ROM game Monty Pythons Complete Waste of Time in 1994, which used many of Gilliams animation templates, and the making of Gilliams film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film) Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), Gilliam was in negotiations with Enteractive, a software company, to tentatively release in the autumn of 1996 a CD-ROM under the same title as his 1978 book, containing all of his thousands of 1970s animation templates as license-free clip arts for people to create their own flash animations, but the project hovered in limbo for years,<ref>Cate, Hans ten (1996) [http://www.dailyllama.com/news/1996/llama020.html "Animations of Mortality:" Terry Gilliams New Interactive CD-ROM Game]. Monty Pythons Daily Llama. 16 January 1996.</ref><ref name="TGinterviews">Sterrit, David; Rhodes, Lucille (2004).

Around the time of Gilliams film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009), the project had changed into the idea of releasing his 1970s animation templates as a license-free download of Adobe After Effects or similar files.

Besides creating the animations, he also appeared in several sketches, though he rarely had main roles and did considerably less acting in the sketches. He did, however, have some notable sketch roles, such as Cardinal Fang of the The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python) Spanish Inquisition; the bespectacled commenter who said, "I cant add anything to that!" in the sketch "Election Night Special"; Kevin Garibaldi, the brat on the couch shouting "I want more beans!" in the sketch "Most Awful Family in Britain 1974" (episode 45); the Screaming Queen in a cape and mask in The Visitors; and Percy Bysshe Shelly in Ant Poetry Reading. More frequently, he played parts that no one else wanted to play, generally because they required a lot of makeup or uncomfortable costumes (such as the recurring character of a knight in armour who ended sketches by walking on and hitting one of the other characters over the head with a plucked chicken). He took a number of small roles in the films, including Patsy (Monty Python) Patsy in Monty Python and the Holy Grail (which he co-directed with Terry Jones; Gilliam was responsible for photography, while Jones guided the actors performances) and the jailer in Monty Pythons Life of Brian. He also designed the covers of most of the Monty Python albums, including Another Monty Python Record, The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief and Monty Python Live at Drury Lane, and their film soundtrack albums.

===Directing===
With the gradual breakup of the Python troupe between Life of Brian in 1979 and Monty Pythons The Meaning of Life The Meaning of Life in 1983, Gilliam became a screenwriter and director, building upon the experience he had acquired during the making of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. He says he used to think of his films in terms of trilogies, starting with Time Bandits: the "Trilogy of Imagination" (written by Gilliam) about "the ages of man" in Time Bandits (1981), Brazil (1985), and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). All are about the "craziness of our awkwardly ordered society and the desire to escape it through whatever means possible."<ref name="essay">Matthews, Jack (1996). Dreaming Brazil. Essay accompanying the The Criterion Collection Criterion Collection DVD.</ref> All three movies focus on these struggles and attempts to escape them through imagination; Time Bandits through the eyes of a child, Brazil through the eyes of a man in his thirties, and Munchausen, through the eyes of an elderly man.

In the 1990s, Gilliam directed a trilogy of Americana: The Fisher King (1991), 12 Monkeys (1995), and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), which played on North American soil and, while still surreal, had less fantastical plots than his previous trilogy.<ref>Pirie, Chris (2002).

===Themes and philosophy===
{{quote Well, I really want to encourage a kind of fantasy, a kind of magic. I love the term magic realism, whoever invented it&nbsp;– I do actually like it because it says certain things. Its about expanding how you see the world. I think we live in an age where were just hammered, hammered to think this is what the world is. Televisions saying, everythings saying Thats the world. And its not the world. The world is a million possible things.<ref name="rushdie" />}}

As for his philosophical background in screenwriting and directing, Gilliam said on the TV show First Hand on RoundhouseTV, "Theres so many film schools, so many media courses which I actually am opposed to. Because I think its more important to be educated, to read, to learn things, because if youre gonna be in the media and if youll have to say things, you have to know things. If you only know about cameras and the media, whatre you gonna be talking about except cameras and the media? So its better learning about philosophy and art and architecture [and] literature, these are the things to be concentrating on it seems to me. Then, you can fly...!"<ref>{{YouTube 1v7YjOCC-cM Terry Gilliam}}. Uploaded by RoundhouseTV.</ref>

His films are usually imaginative fantasy fantasies. His long-time co-writer Charles McKeown commented, "the theme of imagination, and the importance of imagination, to how you live and how you think and so on&nbsp;... thats very much a Terry theme."<ref>Stubbs, Phil (2008). [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/parncmck.htm "Charles McKeown on writing the Dr Parnassus script"]. Dreams.</ref> Most of Gilliams movies include plotlines that seem to occur partly or completely in the characters imaginations, raising questions about the definition of Personal identity identity and sanity. He often shows his opposition to bureaucracy and authoritarian regimes. He also distinguishes "higher" and "lower" layers of society, with a disturbing and ironic style. His movies usually feature a fight or struggle against a great power which may be an emotional situation, a human-made Cult image idol, or even the person himself, and the situations do not always end happily. There is often a dark, paranoia paranoid atmosphere and unusual characters who used to be normal members of society. His scripts feature black comedy and often end with a dark tragicomedy tragicomic twist.

Gilliam is fascinated with the Baroque period because of the pronounced struggle between spirituality and rationality in that era.<ref>"The clash between the baroque and the Newtonian view of the world is my message in a bottle." [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/bmfact.htm "Dreams: The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"].</ref><ref name="hamel">"In [Max] Webers view, the technological world of modernity tries to eliminate any need for magic, fantasy, or any irrational forces. Gilliam presents this idea of change from without through certain aspects of his mise-en-scene." Hamel, Keith James. [http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue06/features/brazil.htm "Modernity and Mise-en-Scene: Terry Gilliam and Brazil"]. Images: Journal of Film and Popular Culture, issue 6.</ref> There is often a rich baroqueness and dichotomous eclecticism about his movies, with, for instance, high-tech computer monitors equipped with Fresnel lens low-tech magnifying lenses in Brazil and a red knight covered with flapping bits of cloth in The Fisher King. He also is given to incongruous juxtapositions of beauty and ugliness or antique and modern. Regarding Gilliams theme of modernitys struggle between spirituality and rationality whereas the individual may become dominated by a tyrannical, soulless machinery of Disenchantment disenchanted society, the film critic Keith James Hamel observed a specific affinity of Gilliams movies with the writings of the economic historian Arnold Toynbee and the sociologist Max Weber, specifically the latters concept of the "iron cage" of rationality.<ref name="hamel" />

===Look and style===
File:Terry Gilliam(CannesPhotoCall).jpg thumb upright Gilliam at Cannes, 2001
Gilliams films have a distinctive look, not only in mise-en-scène but even more so in photography, often recognisable from just a short clip; to create a surreal atmosphere of psychological unrest and a world out of balance, he frequently uses unusual camera angles, particularly low-angle shots, high-angle shots, and Dutch angles. Roger Ebert said that "his world is always hallucination hallucinatory in its richness of detail."<ref>{{cite news url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050825/REVIEWS/50822002/1023  title=The Brothers Grimm Review  work=Chicago Sun-Times  accessdate=1 June 2011  first=Chazs  last=Blog}}</ref> Most of his movies are shot almost entirely with rectilinear lens rectilinear ultra wide angle lens ultra-wide-angle lenses with focal lengths of 28mm or less to achieve a distinctive style defined by extreme perspective distortion (photography) perspective distortion and extremely deep focus. Gilliams long-time director of photography Nicola Pecorini has said, "with Terry and me, a long lens means something between a 40mm and a 65mm."<ref>Stubbs, Phil (2011). [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/wholnico.htm Dreams: Nicola Pecorini on The Wholly Family]. Dreams: The Terry Gilliam Fanzine.</ref> This attitude markedly differs from the common definition in photography, by which 40 to 65&nbsp;mm is the focal length of a normal lens, resembling the natural human field of view, unlike Gilliams signature style, defined by extreme perspective distortion due to his usual choice of focal length. The 14-mm lens has become informally known as "The Gilliam" among filmmakers because of his frequent use of it at least since Brazil.<ref>Stubbs, Phil: [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/tidegill.htm "Terry Gilliam Talks Tideland." Dreams.]</ref> Gilliam has explained his preference for using wide-angle lenses in his films:

{{quote The wide-angle lenses, I think I choose them because it makes me feel like Im in the space of the film, Im surrounded. My prevalent vision is full of detail, and thats what I like about it. Its actually harder to do, its harder to light. The other thing I like about wide-angle lenses is that Im not forcing the audience to look at just the one thing that is important. Its there, but theres other things to occupy, and some people dont like that because Im not pointing things out as precisely as I could if I was to use a long lens where Id focus just on the one thing and everything else would be out of focus.&nbsp;...<br>
[M]y films, I think, are better the second and third time, frankly, because you can now relax and go with the flow that may not have been as apparent as the first time you saw it and wallow in the details of the worlds were creating.&nbsp;... I try to clutter [my visuals] up, theyre worthy of many viewings.<ref>Bianculli, David (2009).

Fresh Air. National Public Radio. 22 December 2009.</ref>}}

In another interview, Gilliam mentioned, in relation to the 9.8-mm Kinoptic lens he had first used on Brazil, that wide-angle lenses make small film sets "look big".<ref>Sheehan, Henry (2006).

===Production problems===
File:Terry Gilliam at IFC Center 2006.jpg thumb upright Gilliam at an IFC Center on 4 October 2006
Gilliam has made a few extremely expensive movies beset with production problems. After the lengthy quarrelling with Universal Studios over Brazil (1985 film) Brazil, Gilliams next picture, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, cost around US$46&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=adventuresofbaronmunchausen.htm  title=Box Office Mojo  publisher=Box Office Mojo  date=20 June 1989  accessdate=1 June 2011}}</ref> and then earned only about US$8&nbsp;million in US ticket sales. The film saw no wide domestic release from Columbia Pictures, which was in the process of being sold at the time.

In the mid-1990s, Gilliam and Charles McKeown developed a script for Time Bandits 2, a project that was never produced because several of the original actors had died. Gilliam also attempted to direct a version of Charles Dickenss A Tale of Two Cities, which collapsed due to disagreements over its budget and the choice of a lead actor.<ref>{{cite book

Gilliam attempted twice to adapt Alan Moores Watchmen comics into a film, in 1989 and 1996. Both attempts were unsuccessful.

In 1999, Gilliam attempted to film The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, budgeted at US$32.1&nbsp;million, among the highest-budgeted films to use only European financing; but in the first week of shooting, the actor playing Don Quixote (Jean Rochefort) suffered a Spinal disc herniation herniated disc, and a flood severely damaged the set. The film was cancelled, resulting in an insurance claim of US$15&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite book

From 2002 to 2006, Gilliam tried to get funding for an adaptation of Good Omens, by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, with Robin Williams and Johnny Depp rumored as possible stars, but movie studios found the apocalyptic theme unacceptable in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, and funding never materialized.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/tvandradioblog/2016/apr/15/good-omens-neil-gaiman-to-adapt-terry-pratchett-collaboration-for-tv title=Good Omens: Neil Gaiman to adapt Terry Pratchett collaboration for TV first=Sian last=Cain date=14 April 2016 publisher= accessdate=3 July 2017 via=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.neilgaiman.com/FAQs/Books,_Short_Stories,_and_Films#q15 title=Neil Gaiman - FAQs - Books, Short Stories, and Films website=www.neilgaiman.com accessdate=3 July 2017}}</ref>

More recently, unforeseeable problems again befell a Gilliam project when the actor Heath Ledger died in New York City during the filming of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.

===Box office===
Gilliams first successful feature, Time Bandits (1981), earned more than eight times its original budget in the United States alone. The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), although it was a flop at the box office, was nominated for four Academy Awards (and won, among other European prizes, three British Academy Film Awards BAFTA Awards). The Fisher King (1991), his first film not to feature a member of the Monty Python troupe, had a budget of $24&nbsp;million and grossed more than $41&nbsp;million at United States box office. 12 Monkeys grossed more than US$168&nbsp;million worldwide. The Brothers Grimm (film) The Brothers Grimm, despite a mixed critical reception, grossed over US$105&nbsp;million worldwide. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, with a budget of $30&nbsp;million, has been an international success at the box office, grossing over $60&nbsp;million in worldwide theatrical release.
According to Box Office Mojo, his films have grossed an average of $21,602,510.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=terrygilliam.htm title=Terry Gilliam publisher=}}</ref>

===Recurring collaborators===
Since his first feature, Gilliam has shown a propensity to work with particular actors in numerous productions. Up until the 1990s, each of Gilliams non-Python films has featured at least one of his fellow Monty Python alumni (particularly Palin, Cleese, and Idle), and for his finished projects Gilliam has worked with the following actors at least twice (in order of first film appearance):
* Derrick OConnor (Jabberwocky, Time Bandits, Brazil)
* Derek Deadman (Jabberwocky, Time Bandits, Brazil)
* Jack Purvis (actor) Jack Purvis (Time Bandits, Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen)
* Charles McKeown (Time Bandits, Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen)
* Katherine Helmond (Time Bandits, Brazil, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas)
* Ray Cooper (Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, The Zero Theorem)
* Jonathan Pryce (Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Brothers Grimm, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote)
* Stephen Bridgewater (The Fisher King, 12 Monkeys, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas)
* Peter Stormare (The Brothers Grimm, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, The Zero Theorem)

Other recurring collaborators include Gilliams cinematographers Roger Pratt (cinematographer) Roger Pratt (Brazil, The Fisher King, 12 Monkeys) and Nicola Pecorini (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Brothers Grimm, Tideland, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, The Zero Theorem, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote), and his co-writer McKeown (Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus).

===Gilliam and Harry Potter===
J. K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, is a fan of Gilliams work. Consequently, he was Rowlings first choice to direct Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone (film) Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone in 2000, but Warner Bros. ultimately chose Chris Columbus (filmmaker) Chris Columbus for the job.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000416/bio IMDb: Biography for Terry Gilliam]. Retrieved 22 April 2007.</ref> In response to this decision, Gilliam said that "I was the perfect guy to do Harry Potter. I remember leaving the meeting, getting in my car, and driving for about two hours along Mulholland Drive just so angry. I mean, Chris Columbus versions are terrible. Just dull. Pedestrian."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.wizardnews.com/story.20050829.html  title=Terry Gilliam Bitter About Potter  publisher=Wizardnews.com  date=29 August 2005  accessdate=1 June 2011}}</ref> In 2006, Gilliam said that he found Alfonso Cuaróns Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to be "really good... much closer to what I wouldve done."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1543143/terry-gilliam-tilts-at-hollywood-yet-again.jhtml  title=Terry Gilliam Tilts at Hollywood Yet Again  publisher=MTV  accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref> In retrospect, however, Gilliam has stated that he wouldnt have liked to direct any Harry Potter (film series) Potter film. In a 2005 interview with Total Film, he said that he would not enjoy working on such an expensive project because of interference from studio executives.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/gilliam%20vows%20never%20to%20direct%20harry%20potter  title=Gilliam Vows Never to Direct Harry Potter  publisher=Contactmusic.com  accessdate=1 June 2011}}</ref>

===Projects in development or shelved===
Gilliam has several projects in various states of development, including an adaptation of Neil Gaimans and Terry Pratchetts comic fantasy novel Good Omens.

While promoting the US theatrical release of The Zero Theorem, Gilliam revealed he and LaGravenese were meeting to see if The Defective Detective script could be made into a miniseries. If this comes together, it would be the first time Gilliam has ever directed for television.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Batman-Become-Religion-More-From-Zero-Theorem-Terry-Gilliam-67291-p2.html title=Batmans Become a Religion and More from the Zero Theorems Terry Gilliam publisher=cinemablend.com}}</ref> Stanley Kubrick had Gilliam in mind to direct a sequel to Dr. Strangelove.<ref>{{cite web url=http://twitchfilm.com/2013/10/stanley-kubrick-wanted-terry-gilliam-to-direct-son-of-strangelove.html title=Stanley Kubrick Wanted Terry Gilliam to Direct Son of Stragelove last=Brown first=Todd publisher=Twitch Film date=12 October 2013 accessdate=13 October 2013 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013215342/http://twitchfilm.com/2013/10/stanley-kubrick-wanted-terry-gilliam-to-direct-son-of-strangelove.html archivedate=13 October 2013 df=dmy-all}}</ref>
