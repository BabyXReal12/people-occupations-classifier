Terrence Vance Gilliam ({{IPAc-en ˈ ɡ ɪ l i ə m}}; born 22 November 1940)
is an American-born British screenwriter, film director, animator, actor, comedian and former member of the Monty Python comedy troupe.

Gilliam has directed 12 feature films, including Time Bandits (1981), Brazil (1985 film) Brazil (1985), The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), The Fisher King (1991), 12 Monkeys (1995), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film) Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), The Brothers Grimm (film) The Brothers Grimm (2005), Tideland (film) Tideland (2005), and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009). The only "Python" not born in Britain, he became a naturalised British subject in 1968 and formally Renunciation of United States citizenship renounced his American citizenship in 2006.

Gilliam was born in Minnesota, but spent his high school and college years in Los Angeles. He started his career as an animator and strip cartoonist. He joined Monty Python as the animator of their works, but eventually became a full member and was given acting roles. He became a feature film director in the 1970s. Most of his films explore the theme of imagination and its importance to life, express his opposition to bureaucracy and authoritarianism, and feature characters facing dark or paranoid situations. His own scripts feature black comedy and tragicomedy elements, combined with Plot twist#Surprise ending surprise endings.

==Early life==
Gilliam was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Beatrice (née Vance) and James Hall Gilliam. His father was a travelling salesman for Folgers before becoming a carpenter. Soon after, they moved to nearby Medicine Lake, Minnesota.
The family moved to the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Panorama City, Los Angeles Panorama City in 1952. Gilliam attended Birmingham High School, where he was the president of his class and senior prom king. He was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" and achieved straight As. During high school, he began to avidly read Mad (magazine) Mad magazine, then edited by Harvey Kurtzman, which would later influence Gilliams work.
Gilliam graduated from Occidental College in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science.
Gilliam told Salman Rushdie about defining experiences in the 1960s that, he said, set the foundations for his views on the world:

{{quote I became terrified that I was going to be a full-time, bomb-throwing terrorist if I stayed [in the U.S.] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was 66–67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles. ... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way. ... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night Id be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guys foolish daughter. And I said, "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop. ...

And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, Ive got to get out of here—Im a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. Thats why so much of the U.S. is still standing.

==Career==

===Animation===
Gilliam began his career as an animator and Cartoonist strip cartoonist. One of his early Photonovel photographic strips for Help! (magazine) Help! magazine featured future Python cast member John Cleese.
When Help! folded, Gilliam went to Europe, jokingly announcing in the very last issue that he was "being transferred to the European branch" of the magazine,
which, of course, did not exist. Moving to England, he animated sequences for the childrens series Do Not Adjust Your Set, which also featured Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin.
===Monty Python===
Gilliam was a part of Monty Pythons Flying Circus from its outset, credited at first as an animator (his name was listed separately after the other five in the closing credits) and later as a full member. His cartoons linked the shows sketches together and defined the groups visual language in other media (such as LP and book covers and the title sequences of their films). His animations mix his own art, characterised by soft gradients and odd, bulbous shapes, with backgrounds and moving cutouts from antique photographs, mostly from the Victorian era.

In 1978, Gilliam published Animations of Mortality, an illustrated, tongue-in-cheek, semi-autobiographical how-to guide to his animation techniques and the visual language in them.
Roughly 15 years later, between the release of the CD-ROM game Monty Pythons Complete Waste of Time in 1994, which used many of Gilliams animation templates, and the making of Gilliams film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film) Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), Gilliam was in negotiations with Enteractive, a software company, to tentatively release in the autumn of 1996 a CD-ROM under the same title as his 1978 book, containing all of his thousands of 1970s animation templates as license-free clip arts for people to create their own flash animations, but the project hovered in limbo for years,
probably because Enteractive was about to downsize greatly in mid-1996 and changed its focus from CD-ROM multimedia presentations to internet business solutions and web hosting in 1997
(in the introduction to their 2004 book Terry Gilliam: Interviews,
David Sterrit and Lucille Rhodes claimed that the internet had overwhelmed the "computer-communications market" and gave this as the reason that the Animations of Mortality CD-ROM never materialised). Around the time of Gilliams film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009), the project had changed into the idea of releasing his 1970s animation templates as a license-free download of Adobe After Effects or similar files.

Besides creating the animations, he also appeared in several sketches, though he rarely had main roles and did considerably less acting in the sketches. He did, however, have some notable sketch roles, such as Cardinal Fang of the The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python) Spanish Inquisition; the bespectacled commenter who said, "I cant add anything to that!" in the sketch "Election Night Special"; Kevin Garibaldi, the brat on the couch shouting "I want more beans!" in the sketch "Most Awful Family in Britain 1974" (episode 45); the Screaming Queen in a cape and mask in The Visitors; and Percy Bysshe Shelly in Ant Poetry Reading. More frequently, he played parts that no one else wanted to play, generally because they required a lot of makeup or uncomfortable costumes (such as the recurring character of a knight in armour who ended sketches by walking on and hitting one of the other characters over the head with a plucked chicken). He took a number of small roles in the films, including Patsy (Monty Python) Patsy in Monty Python and the Holy Grail (which he co-directed with Terry Jones; Gilliam was responsible for photography, while Jones guided the actors performances) and the jailer in Monty Pythons Life of Brian. He also designed the covers of most of the Monty Python albums, including Another Monty Python Record, The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief and Monty Python Live at Drury Lane, and their film soundtrack albums.

===Directing===
With the gradual breakup of the Python troupe between Life of Brian in 1979 and Monty Pythons The Meaning of Life The Meaning of Life in 1983, Gilliam became a screenwriter and director, building upon the experience he had acquired during the making of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. He says he used to think of his films in terms of trilogies, starting with Time Bandits: the "Trilogy of Imagination" (written by Gilliam) about "the ages of man" in Time Bandits (1981), Brazil (1985), and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). All are about the "craziness of our awkwardly ordered society and the desire to escape it through whatever means possible."
All three movies focus on these struggles and attempts to escape them through imagination; Time Bandits through the eyes of a child, Brazil through the eyes of a man in his thirties, and Munchausen, through the eyes of an elderly man.

In the 1990s, Gilliam directed a trilogy of Americana: The Fisher King (1991), 12 Monkeys (1995), and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), which played on North American soil and, while still surreal, had less fantastical plots than his previous trilogy.
===Themes and philosophy===
{{quote Well, I really want to encourage a kind of fantasy, a kind of magic. I love the term magic realism, whoever invented it – I do actually like it because it says certain things. Its about expanding how you see the world. I think we live in an age where were just hammered, hammered to think this is what the world is. Televisions saying, everythings saying Thats the world. And its not the world. The world is a million possible things.
}}

As for his philosophical background in screenwriting and directing, Gilliam said on the TV show First Hand on RoundhouseTV, "Theres so many film schools, so many media courses which I actually am opposed to. Because I think its more important to be educated, to read, to learn things, because if youre gonna be in the media and if youll have to say things, you have to know things. If you only know about cameras and the media, whatre you gonna be talking about except cameras and the media? So its better learning about philosophy and art and architecture [and] literature, these are the things to be concentrating on it seems to me. Then, you can fly...!"
His films are usually imaginative fantasy fantasies. His long-time co-writer Charles McKeown commented, "the theme of imagination, and the importance of imagination, to how you live and how you think and so on ... thats very much a Terry theme."
Most of Gilliams movies include plotlines that seem to occur partly or completely in the characters imaginations, raising questions about the definition of Personal identity identity and sanity. He often shows his opposition to bureaucracy and authoritarian regimes. He also distinguishes "higher" and "lower" layers of society, with a disturbing and ironic style. His movies usually feature a fight or struggle against a great power which may be an emotional situation, a human-made Cult image idol, or even the person himself, and the situations do not always end happily. There is often a dark, paranoia paranoid atmosphere and unusual characters who used to be normal members of society. His scripts feature black comedy and often end with a dark tragicomedy tragicomic twist.

Gilliam is fascinated with the Baroque period because of the pronounced struggle between spirituality and rationality in that era.
There is often a rich baroqueness and dichotomous eclecticism about his movies, with, for instance, high-tech computer monitors equipped with Fresnel lens low-tech magnifying lenses in Brazil and a red knight covered with flapping bits of cloth in The Fisher King. He also is given to incongruous juxtapositions of beauty and ugliness or antique and modern. Regarding Gilliams theme of modernitys struggle between spirituality and rationality whereas the individual may become dominated by a tyrannical, soulless machinery of Disenchantment disenchanted society, the film critic Keith James Hamel observed a specific affinity of Gilliams movies with the writings of the economic historian Arnold Toynbee and the sociologist Max Weber, specifically the latters concept of the "iron cage" of rationality.
===Look and style===
File:Terry Gilliam(CannesPhotoCall).jpg thumb upright Gilliam at Cannes, 2001
Gilliams films have a distinctive look, not only in mise-en-scène but even more so in photography, often recognisable from just a short clip; to create a surreal atmosphere of psychological unrest and a world out of balance, he frequently uses unusual camera angles, particularly low-angle shots, high-angle shots, and Dutch angles. Roger Ebert said that "his world is always hallucination hallucinatory in its richness of detail."
Most of his movies are shot almost entirely with rectilinear lens rectilinear ultra wide angle lens ultra-wide-angle lenses with focal lengths of 28mm or less to achieve a distinctive style defined by extreme perspective distortion (photography) perspective distortion and extremely deep focus. Gilliams long-time director of photography Nicola Pecorini has said, "with Terry and me, a long lens means something between a 40mm and a 65mm."
This attitude markedly differs from the common definition in photography, by which 40 to 65 mm is the focal length of a normal lens, resembling the natural human field of view, unlike Gilliams signature style, defined by extreme perspective distortion due to his usual choice of focal length. The 14-mm lens has become informally known as "The Gilliam" among filmmakers because of his frequent use of it at least since Brazil.
Gilliam has explained his preference for using wide-angle lenses in his films:

{{quote The wide-angle lenses, I think I choose them because it makes me feel like Im in the space of the film, Im surrounded. My prevalent vision is full of detail, and thats what I like about it. Its actually harder to do, its harder to light. The other thing I like about wide-angle lenses is that Im not forcing the audience to look at just the one thing that is important. Its there, but theres other things to occupy, and some people dont like that because Im not pointing things out as precisely as I could if I was to use a long lens where Id focus just on the one thing and everything else would be out of focus. ...
<br/>
[M]y films, I think, are better the second and third time, frankly, because you can now relax and go with the flow that may not have been as apparent as the first time you saw it and wallow in the details of the worlds were creating. ... I try to clutter [my visuals] up, theyre worthy of many viewings.
}}

In another interview, Gilliam mentioned, in relation to the 9.8-mm Kinoptic lens he had first used on Brazil, that wide-angle lenses make small film sets "look big".
The widest lens he has used so far is an 8-mm Carl Zeiss AG Zeiss lens employed in filming The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.
===Production problems===
File:Terry Gilliam at IFC Center 2006.jpg thumb upright Gilliam at an IFC Center on 4 October 2006
Gilliam has made a few extremely expensive movies beset with production problems. After the lengthy quarrelling with Universal Studios over Brazil (1985 film) Brazil, Gilliams next picture, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, cost around US$46 million,
and then earned only about US$8 million in US ticket sales. The film saw no wide domestic release from Columbia Pictures, which was in the process of being sold at the time.

In the mid-1990s, Gilliam and Charles McKeown developed a script for Time Bandits 2, a project that was never produced because several of the original actors had died. Gilliam also attempted to direct a version of Charles Dickenss A Tale of Two Cities, which collapsed due to disagreements over its budget and the choice of a lead actor.
Gilliam attempted twice to adapt Alan Moores Watchmen comics into a film, in 1989 and 1996. Both attempts were unsuccessful.

In 1999, Gilliam attempted to film The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, budgeted at US$32.1 million, among the highest-budgeted films to use only European financing; but in the first week of shooting, the actor playing Don Quixote (Jean Rochefort) suffered a Spinal disc herniation herniated disc, and a flood severely damaged the set. The film was cancelled, resulting in an insurance claim of US$15 million.
Despite the cancellation, the aborted project did yield the documentary Lost in La Mancha, produced from film from a second crew that had been hired by Gilliam to document the making of Quixote. After the cancellation, both Gilliam and the films co-lead, Johnny Depp, wanted to revive the project. The insurance company involved in the failed first attempt withheld the rights to the screenplay for several years
but the production was restarted in 2008.
From 2002 to 2006, Gilliam tried to get funding for an adaptation of Good Omens, by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, with Robin Williams and Johnny Depp rumored as possible stars, but movie studios found the apocalyptic theme unacceptable in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, and funding never materialized.
More recently, unforeseeable problems again befell a Gilliam project when the actor Heath Ledger died in New York City during the filming of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.

===Box office===
Gilliams first successful feature, Time Bandits (1981), earned more than eight times its original budget in the United States alone. The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), although it was a flop at the box office, was nominated for four Academy Awards (and won, among other European prizes, three British Academy Film Awards BAFTA Awards). The Fisher King (1991), his first film not to feature a member of the Monty Python troupe, had a budget of $24 million and grossed more than $41 million at United States box office. 12 Monkeys grossed more than US$168 million worldwide. The Brothers Grimm (film) The Brothers Grimm, despite a mixed critical reception, grossed over US$105 million worldwide. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, with a budget of $30 million, has been an international success at the box office, grossing over $60 million in worldwide theatrical release.
According to Box Office Mojo, his films have grossed an average of $21,602,510.
===Recurring collaborators===
Since his first feature, Gilliam has shown a propensity to work with particular actors in numerous productions. Up until the 1990s, each of Gilliams non-Python films has featured at least one of his fellow Monty Python alumni (particularly Palin, Cleese, and Idle), and for his finished projects Gilliam has worked with the following actors at least twice (in order of first film appearance):
* Derrick OConnor (Jabberwocky, Time Bandits, Brazil)
* Derek Deadman (Jabberwocky, Time Bandits, Brazil)
* Jack Purvis (actor) Jack Purvis (Time Bandits, Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen)
* Charles McKeown (Time Bandits, Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen)
* Katherine Helmond (Time Bandits, Brazil, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas)
* Ray Cooper (Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, The Zero Theorem)
* Jonathan Pryce (Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Brothers Grimm, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote)
* Stephen Bridgewater (The Fisher King, 12 Monkeys, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas)
* Peter Stormare (The Brothers Grimm, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, The Zero Theorem)

Other recurring collaborators include Gilliams cinematographers Roger Pratt (cinematographer) Roger Pratt (Brazil, The Fisher King, 12 Monkeys) and Nicola Pecorini (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Brothers Grimm, Tideland, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, The Zero Theorem, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote), and his co-writer McKeown (Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus).

===Gilliam and Harry Potter===
J. K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, is a fan of Gilliams work. Consequently, he was Rowlings first choice to direct Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone (film) Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone in 2000, but Warner Bros. ultimately chose Chris Columbus (filmmaker) Chris Columbus for the job.
In response to this decision, Gilliam said that "I was the perfect guy to do Harry Potter. I remember leaving the meeting, getting in my car, and driving for about two hours along Mulholland Drive just so angry. I mean, Chris Columbus versions are terrible. Just dull. Pedestrian."
In 2006, Gilliam said that he found Alfonso Cuaróns Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to be "really good... much closer to what I wouldve done."
In retrospect, however, Gilliam has stated that he wouldnt have liked to direct any Harry Potter (film series) Potter film. In a 2005 interview with Total Film, he said that he would not enjoy working on such an expensive project because of interference from studio executives.
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1, director David Yates paid homage to Gilliams 1985 film Brazil (1985 film) Brazil, portraying the Death Eater–infiltrated Ministry of Magic in a fashion reminiscent of Gilliams totalitarian bureaucracy.
===Secret Tournament===
In 2002, Gilliam directed a series of television advertisements called Secret Tournament.
The advertisements were part of Nike, Inc. Nikes FIFA World Cup campaign and featured a secret three-on-three tournament between the worlds best football players inside a huge tanker ship, accompanied by the Elvis Presley song "A Little Less Conversation".

===Slavas Diabolo===
File:Terry Gilliam KVIFF.jpg thumb right Gilliam at the 41st Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, April 2006
In 2006, Gilliam directed the stage show Slavas Diabolo, created and staged by the Russian clown artist Slava Polunin. The show combined Polunins clown style, characterised by deep nonverbal expression and interaction with the audience, with Gilliams rich visuals and surrealistic imagery. The show premiered at the Noga Hall of the Gesher Theatre in Jaffa, Israel.

===The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus===
The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, directed and co-written by Gilliam, was released in 2009.
In January 2007, Gilliam announced that he had been working on a new project with his writing partner Charles McKeown. One day later, the fansite Dreams reported
that the new project was titled The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. In October 2007, Dreams confirmed that this would be Gilliams next project and was slated to star Christopher Plummer and Tom Waits.
Production began in December 2007 in London.
On 22 January 2008, production of the film was disrupted following the death of Heath Ledger in New York City. Variety (magazine) Variety reported that Ledgers involvement had been a "key factor" in the films financing.
Production was suspended indefinitely by 24 January,
but in February the actors Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell signed on to continue Ledgers role, transforming into multiple incarnations of his character in the "magical" world of the film.
Thanks to this arrangement the principal photography was completed on 15 April 2008, on schedule. Editing was completed in November 2008.
According to the official ParnassusFilm Twitter channel
launched on 30 March 2009, the films post-production FX work finished on 31 March. During the filming, Gilliam was accidentally hit by a bus and suffered a broken back.
The film had successful screenings including a premiere at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival 62nd Cannes Film Festival. The UK release for the film was scheduled for 6 June 2009 but was pushed back to 16 October 2009. The USA release was on 25 December 2009. Eventually, this $30 million-budgeted film had grossed more than $60 million in worldwide theatrical release and received two Academy Award nominations.

The films end credit states that the film is dedicated to the memories of Ledger and William Vince. Depp, Farrell, and Law donated their proceeds from the film to Ledgers daughter.
===The Zero Theorem===
In July 2012, Gilliam revealed plans for a film which would be shot in Bucharest, Romania. He denied that it would be Don Quixote but refused to give any further details.
The actor David Walliams reportedly entered into talks with Gilliam to play a part in it and was told that hed have to "be willing to work with Johnny Depp and fly to Bucharest where the movie is to be filmed."
Depp, to that point, had made no mention of his involvement but was seen in Bucharest around the same time in mid-July
as Romanian news outlets reported Gilliam was staying in the city for negotiations on studio work with the Romanian film production company MediaPro Studios.
On 13 August 2012, this project was announced to be The Zero Theorem, set to start shooting in Bucharest on 22 October, produced by Dean Zanuck (son of the late Richard D. Zanuck, who was originally to produce the film in 2009), with worldwide sales handled by Voltage Pictures, Toronto, and starring the Academy Award–winner Christoph Waltz in the lead (replacing Billy Bob Thornton, who had been attached to the project in 2009).
The Zero Theorem premiered at the 70th Venice International Film Festival on 2 September 2013.
===Opera director===
Gilliam made his opera debut at Londons English National Opera (ENO) in May 2011, directing The Damnation of Faust, by Hector Berlioz.
The production received positive reviews in the British press
On 16 September 2012, the production opened at the Vlaamse Opera in Ghent, Belgium, in the operas original French-language version and received praise from critics and audiences alike. After a number of performances in Ghent, the production moved to the opera house in Antwerp for sold-out run of performances.

In June 2014, Gilliam followed up on his success with Faust with a new ENO production of another opera by Berlioz, the rarely performed Benvenuto Cellini (opera) Benvenuto Cellini.
===Projects in development or shelved===
Gilliam has several projects in various states of development, including an adaptation of Neil Gaimans and Terry Pratchetts comic fantasy novel Good Omens. Other projects Gilliam has been trying to get off the ground since the 1990s are an adaptation of Charles Dickenss A Tale of Two Cities (starring Mel Gibson); an adaptation of Mark Twains A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court, which has been List of films based on Arthurian legend#Connecticut Yankee adapted as movies several times before; and a script entitled The Defective Detective, which Gilliam wrote with Richard LaGravenese (who wrote The Fisher King). While promoting the US theatrical release of The Zero Theorem, Gilliam revealed he and LaGravenese were meeting to see if The Defective Detective script could be made into a miniseries. If this comes together, it would be the first time Gilliam has ever directed for television.
Stanley Kubrick had Gilliam in mind to direct a sequel to Dr. Strangelove.
It was rumoured that Gilliam may direct or be involved in the production of the animated band Gorillaz movie. In a September 2006 interview with Uncut (magazine) Uncut, Damon Albarn was reported to have said, "were making a film. Weve got Terry Gilliam involved."
However, in a more recent interview with Gorillaz-Unofficial, Jamie Hewlett, the co-creator of the band, stated that since the time of the previous interview, Damons and his own interest in the film had lessened. In an August 2008 The Observer Observer interview, Gorillaz band members Albarn and Hewlett revealed the nature and title of the project, Journey to the West, a movie adaptation of the Monkey: Journey to the West opera of the same name, based on a 16th-century Chinese adventure story also known as Monkey (novel) Monkey.
In January 2008, while on set of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, Gilliam stated that he was looking forward to the project, "But Im still waiting to see a script!"
===The Man Who Killed Don Quixote===
After regaining the rights to the screenplay of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, Gilliam restarted preproduction in 2008, with Johnny Depp still attached to the project.
The film was to be reshot completely, with Rocheforts role recast. Michael Palin reportedly entered into talks with Gilliam about stepping in for Rochefort and playing Don Quixote.
However, Gilliam revealed on the Canadian talk show The Hour (Canadian TV series) The Hour on 17 December 2009 that Robert Duvall had been cast to play Quixote, before the film was postponed once again.
In January 2014, Gilliam wrote on Facebook that "Dreams of Don Quixote have begun again".
At the Cannes Film Festival in 2016, it was confirmed that The Man Who Killed Don Quixote was going to be made, with Michael Palin and Adam Driver in starring roles.
In March 2017, filming finally began, with Driver and Jonathan Pryce starring.
On 4 June 2017, Gilliam announced that the shooting of the film was complete.
The film premiered on 19 May 2018 as the closing film of the 2018 Cannes Film Festival (where it received a standing ovation), and was released in French theaters the same day.
===Future projects===
On 16 December 2010, Variety (magazine) Variety reported that Gilliam was to "godfather" a film called 1884, described as an animated steampunk parody of George Orwells Nineteen Eighty-Four, with several former Pythons lending their voices to the project; Gilliam was to be credited as "creative advisor".
During the second half of 2011, Gilliam and Paul Auster wrote a screenplay for a film adaptation of Austers novel Mr. Vertigo.
In June 2018, Gilliam announced at the Brussels International Film Festival that he was working again on Mr. Vertigo, and that it might be his next film, and that he had Ralph Fiennes attached to star in it.
He is in talks to make his first animated feature film with Laika (company) Laika, the studio behind Coraline (film) Coraline and ParaNorman.
In October 2015, in a webchat hosted by The Guardian, Gilliam announced that he was working on "a TV series based on Time Bandits" and "another based on a script by Richard LaGravanese and I wrote after Fisher King, called The Defective Detective."
==Charitable activities==
Gilliam has been involved with a number of charitable and humanitarian causes. In 2009, he became a board member of Videre Est Credere (Latin for "to see is to believe"), a UK human rights charity.
Videre describes itself as giving "local activists the equipment, training and support needed to safely capture compelling video evidence of human rights violations. This captured footage is verified, analysed and then distributed to those who can create change."
He participates alongside movie producer Uri Fruchtmann, music producer Brian Eno and executive director of Greenpeace UK John Sauven.

==Personal life==
Gilliam has been married to British makeup and costume designer Maggie Weston since 1973. She worked on Monty Pythons Flying Circus, many of the Python movies, and Gilliams movies up to The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. They have three children, Amy Rainbow Gilliam (born 1978), Holly Dubois Gilliam (born in October 1980), and Harry Thunder Gilliam (born on 3 April 1988), who have also appeared in or worked on several of his films.

In 1968, Gilliam obtained British citizenship. He held dual American and British citizenship for the next 38 years, until he renounced his American citizenship in January 2006.
In an interview with Der Tagesspiegel,
he described the action as a protest against then-President George W. Bush, and in an earlier interview with The A.V. Club, he also indicated that it was related to concerns about future tax liability for his wife and children.
As a result of renouncing his citizenship, Gilliam was permitted to spend 30 days each year in the US over the next 10 years, "less than any European".
He maintains a residence in Italy near the Umbria–Tuscany border. He has been instrumental in establishing the annual Umbria Film Festival,
held in the nearby town of Montone. Gilliam also resides in Highgate, London.
On 8 September 2015, Variety (magazine) Variety mistakenly published a false obituary claiming that Gilliam died.
In May 2018, Gilliam suffered a perforated medullary artery that was erroneously reported in the media as a stroke.
