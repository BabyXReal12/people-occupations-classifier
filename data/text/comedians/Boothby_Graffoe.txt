Boothby Graffoe (born James Martyn Rogers, 20 October 1962), is an England English comedian, singer, songwriter and playwright. He is particularly known for his surreal sense of humour and work with Canadian band Barenaked Ladies.

==Early life==
Rogers was born in 1962 in Kingston upon Hull Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. For the latter part of his schooling, he attended the Queen Elizabeths Grammar School, Horncastle Queen Elizabeths Grammar School in Horncastle, Lincolnshire Horncastle. At the age of 18, he became a member of the Redcoats (Butlins) redcoats at a Butlins on the south coast. He named his alter ego after an Boothby Graffoe English village while driving back from a gig in the late 1980s. His family still live in the Tattershall area. He claims to be the only comedian in the world named after a Lincolnshire village.

==Stand-up comedy==
Graffoe often incorporates guitar playing into his stage act, through his oddball (and usually slightly twisted) songs, including such titles as "Planet Dog", "Woof" and his albums title track, "Wot Italian" (sometimes referred to as "Umbrella Head Boy"). Some of his song titles are still more surreal, in that they do not reflect the subject matter, such as "Giraffes Dont Play Harmonicas, So It Cant Be a Giraffe" and "The Consequences of Living in a Container". He is currently accompanied by the violinist Nick Pynn, having previously toured with acoustic guitarist Antonio Forcione.

He explained his reasons for increasingly irrelevant song titles as — essentially — ways to avoid giving away the key phrases or punchlines in his songs. For instance, he renamed "Umbrella Head Boy" to "Wot Italian" after realising that audiences familiar with his work would ask him to "Play Umbrella Head Boy", thus rendering the surprise element of this line in the song redundant to others.

In 2005 he participated in the Danish stand-up tour "Stand-up DK UK OK" with Danish comedians Rune Klan, Carsten Eskelund and Christian Geo Heltboe Geo, this went on tour around Denmark and was never released on DVD.

On a tour of Scotland in February–March 2007, Graffoe announced his intention to retire from stand-up comedy and concentrate on writing for Omid Djalili. He subsequently toured as a warm-up act for Djalili and Barenaked Ladies, but has recently announced a new tour<ref name="TROBG">{{Cite web  url=http://www.thereturnofboothbygraffoe.co.uk  title=The Return of Boothby Graffoe  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521105656/http://www.thereturnofboothbygraffoe.co.uk/  archivedate=21 May 2013}}</ref> and album (Songs for Dogs Funerals).

Boothby mostly performs solo, with various members of the band joining him to play bass (Jim Creeggan), keyboard (Kevin Hearn) and drums (guitarist Ed Robertson) for some of the songs.
