George Denis Patrick Carlin (May 12, 1937 – June 22, 2008) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, author, and social critic.

Carlin was noted for his black comedy and reflections on politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and various taboo subjects. He and his "seven dirty words" comedy routine were central to the 1978 Supreme Court of the United States U.S. Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, in which a 5–4 decision affirmed the governments power to Censorship in the United States#Broadcast censorship regulate indecent material on the public airwaves. He is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential stand-up comics; one newspaper called Carlin "the dean of counterculture of the 1960s counterculture comedians".<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.cleveland.com/people/index.ssf/2008/06/george_carlin_counterculture_c.html  title=George Carlin, counterculture comedians dean, dies at 71  first=Michael  last=Norman  work=The Plain Dealer  location=Cleveland, Ohio  date=June 23, 2008  accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref> In April 2004, he placed second on the Comedy Central list of "Top 10 Comedians of US Audiences".<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/index.htm  title=Stand Up Comedy & Comedians  publisher=Comedy Zone  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123214352/http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/index.htm  archivedate=November 23, 2005  accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref>

The first of Carlins 14 stand-up comedy specials for HBO was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s, Carlins routines focused on sociocultural criticism of American society. He often commented on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirized the excesses of American culture. He was a frequent performer and guest host on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson The Tonight Show during the three-decade Johnny Carson era, and hosted the first episode of Saturday Night Live in 1975. His final HBO special, Its Bad for Ya, was filmed less than four months before his death. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.  In 2017, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him second (behind Richard Pryor) on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199 The 50 Best Stand-up Comics of All Time].

In the 1960s, Carlin began appearing on television variety shows, where he played various characters:<ref name=timeline />
* The Indian Sergeant&nbsp;– "There will be a rain dance tonight ... weather permitting ..."
* Stupid disc jockeys ("Wonderful WINO radio...")&nbsp;– "The Beatles latest record, when played backwards at slow speed, says, Dummy! Youre playing it backwards at slow speed!"
* Al Sleet, the Hippie-Dippie Weatherman&nbsp;– "Tonights forecast: Dark. Continued mostly dark tonight, changing to widely scattered light towards morning."

Variations on these routines appear on Carlins 1967 debut album, Take-Offs and Put-Ons, which was recorded live in 1966 at The Roostertail in Detroit Detroit, Michigan and issued by RCA Victor in 1967.<ref name=timeline>{{cite web  url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/home/home.html  title=George Carlins official site (see Timeline)  publisher=Georgecarlin.com  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008001351/http://www.georgecarlin.com/home/home.html  archivedate=October 8, 2009  accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref>

During this period, Carlin became a frequent performer and guest host on The Tonight Show, initially with Jack Paar as host, then with Johnny Carson. Carlin became one of Carsons most frequent substitutes during the hosts three-decade reign. Carlin was also cast in Away We Go, a 1967 comedy show that aired on CBS.<ref>{{cite web   url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061235/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast   title=Away We Go (1967– ) Full Cast & Crew   website=IMDb   access-date=June 18, 2016}}</ref> His material during his early career and his appearance, which consisted of suits and short-cropped hair, had been seen as "conventional", particularly when contrasted with his later anti-establishment material.<ref>ABC World News Tonight; June 23, 2008.</ref>

Carlin was present at Lenny Bruces arrest for obscenity. As the police began attempting to detain members of the audience for questioning, they asked Carlin for his identification. Telling the police he did not believe in government-issued IDs, he was arrested and taken to jail with Bruce in the same vehicle.<ref>{{cite episode title=Profanity episodelink=List of Bullshit! episodes series=Penn & Teller: Bullshit! serieslink=Penn & Teller: Bullshit! network=Showtime (TV network) Showtime airdate=August 12, 2004 season=2 number=10}}</ref>

Eventually, Carlin changed his routines and his appearance. Carlin hired talent managers – Jeff Wald and Ron De Blasio – to help him reinvent his image, making him look more Hip (slang) hip for a younger audience. Wald put Carlin into much smaller clubs such as The Troubadour, West Hollywood The Troubadour in West Hollywood and The Bitter End in New York City. Wald says that Carlins income was thus reduced by 90%, but his later career arc was greatly improved.<ref name=Zoglin>{{cite book  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xg1h5lBheQC&pg=PT34  pages=34–35  last=Zoglin  first=Richard  title=Comedy at the Edge: How Stand-up in the 1970s Changed America  publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing  year=2008  isbn=9781596919440  accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> In 1970, record producer Monte Kay formed the Little David Records subsidiary of Atlantic Records, with comedian Flip Wilson as co-owner.<ref>Sullivan 2010, p. 114.</ref> Kay and Wilson signed Carlin away from RCA Records, and recorded a Carlin performance at Washington, D.C.s The Cellar Door in May 1971—this was released as FM & AM in January 1972.

Using his own persona as a springboard for his new comedy, he was presented by Ed Sullivan in a performance of "The Hair Piece" and quickly regained his popularity as the public caught on to his sense of style.<ref name="GoldmarkBio">{{cite web last1=Goldmark first1=Tony title=George Carlin – Biography url=http://www.amoeba.com/george-carlin/artist/146678/bio website=Amoeba Music accessdate=September 1, 2016 quote=He bridged these two sides of his persona with The Hair Piece, a whimsical poem about public aversion to long hair that he performed on Ed Sullivan, effectively reintroducing and reinventing himself to America.

Starting in 1972, singer-songwriter Kenny Rankin was Carlins label mate on Little David Records, and Rankin served many times as Carlins musical guest or opening act during the early 1970s. The two flew together in Carlins private jet; Carlin says that Rankin relapsed into using cocaine while on tour since Carlin had so much of the drug available.<ref name=Jet/>

The album FM & AM proved very popular. It marked Carlins change from mainstream to counterculture comedy. The "AM" side was an extension of Carlins previous style, with zany but relatively clean routines parodying aspects of American life. The "FM" side introduced Carlins new style, with references to marijuana and birth control pills, and a playful examination of the word "shit." In this manner, Carlin renewed a style of radical social commentary comedy that Lenny Bruce had pioneered in the late 1950s.<ref name=Zoglin/>

In this period Carlin perfected his well-known routine, "Seven dirty words Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television", recorded on Class Clown. On July 21, 1972, Carlin was arrested after performing this routine at Milwaukees Summerfest and charged with violating obscenity laws.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471 title=Carlins naughty words still ring in officers ears author=Jim Stingl publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel date=June 30, 2007 accessdate=March 23, 2008 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124942/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471 archivedate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> The case, which prompted Carlin to refer to the words for a time as "the Milwaukee Seven", was dismissed in December of that year; the judge declared that the language was indecent but Carlin had the freedom to say it as long as he caused no disturbance. In 1973, a man complained to the Federal Communications Commission after listening with his son to a similar routine, "Filthy Words", from Occupation: Foole, broadcast one afternoon over WBAI, a Pacifica Foundation FM radio station in New York City. Pacifica received a citation from the FCC for violating regulations that prohibit broadcasting "obscene" material. The Supreme Court of the United States U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC action by a vote of 5 to 4, ruling that the routine was "indecent but not obscene" and that the FCC had authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience (F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978); the court documents contain a complete transcript of the routine).<ref name="EFF">{{cite web  url=https://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/FCC_v_Pacifica/fcc_v_pacifica.decision  title=FCC vs. Pacifica Foundation  date=July 3, 1978  publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation  accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref>

The controversy increased Carlins fame. He eventually expanded the dirty-words theme with a seemingly interminable end to a performance (ending with his voice fading out in one HBO version, and accompanying the credits in the Carlin at Carnegie special for the 1982–83 season) and a set of 49 web pages organized by subject and embracing his "Incomplete List of Impolite Words."<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/dirty/2443.html  title=BBS – Incomplete List of Impolite Words  publisher=George Carlin  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406052624/http://www.georgecarlin.com/dirty/2443.html  archivedate=April 6, 2012  accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref>

On stage, during a rendition of his "Dirty Words" routine, Carlin learned that his previous comedy album FM & AM had won the Grammy. Midway through the performance on the album Occupation: Foole, he can be heard thanking someone for handing him a piece of paper. He then exclaimed "Shit!" and proudly announced his win to the audience.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55pfcmUzGhw#t=2355  title=George Carlin – Occupation: Foole}}</ref>

Carlin continued doing HBO specials every year or every other year over the following decade and a half.

Carlin began to achieve prominence as a film actor with a major supporting role in the 1987 comedy hit Outrageous Fortune (film) Outrageous Fortune, starring Bette Midler and Shelley Long; it was his first notable screen role after a handful of previous guest roles on television series. Playing drifter Frank Madras, the role poked fun at the lingering effect of the 1960s counterculture. In 1989, he gained popularity with a new generation of teens when he was cast as Rufus, the time-traveling mentor of the title characters in Bill & Teds Excellent Adventure, and reprised his role in the film sequel Bill and Teds Bogus Journey as well as the first season of the Bill & Teds Excellent Adventures (1990 TV series) cartoon series. He also played the role of "Mr Conductor" on the PBS show Shining Time Station and narrated the shows sequences of the American version of Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends from 1991 to 1995, replacing Ringo Starr.

There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... [but] I was incredibly happy when the show was canceled. I was frustrated that it had taken me away from my true work."<ref>Last Words, Simon & Schuster, 2009</ref>

Carlin later explained that there were other, more pragmatic reasons for abandoning his acting career in favor of standup. In an interview for Esquire (magazine) Esquire magazine in 2001, he said, "Because of my abuse of drugs, I neglected my business affairs and had large arrears with the IRS, and that took me eighteen to twenty years to dig out of. I did it honorably, and I dont begrudge them. I dont hate paying taxes, and Im not angry at anyone, because I was complicit in it. But Ill tell you what it did for me: it made me a way better comedian. Because I had to stay out on the road and I couldnt pursue that movie career, which would have gone nowhere, and I became a really good comic and a really good writer."<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/george-carlin-quotes-0102  title=What Ive Learned: George Carlin  publisher=Esquire.com  date=June 23, 2008  author=Larry Getlen  accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref>

Carlin was honored at the 1997 Aspen Comedy Festival with a retrospective, George Carlin: 40 Years of Comedy, hosted by Jon Stewart. His first hardcover book, Brain Droppings (1997), sold nearly 900,000 copies and spent 40 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=19830 title=The Kennedy Center accessdate=June 12, 2014 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111638/http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=19830 archivedate=December 24, 2013 df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2001, Carlin was given a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 15th Annual American Comedy Awards.
In December 2003 Representative Doug Ose (R-California) introduced a bill (H.R. 3687) to outlaw the broadcast of Carlins "seven dirty words",<ref name=":0">{{Cite web url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/3687 title=H.R.3687 - To amend section 1464 of title 18, United States Code, to provide for the punishment of certain profane broadcasts, and for other purposes. last= first= date=December 8, 2003 website=congress.gov access-date=}}</ref> including "compound use (including hyphenated compounds) of such words and phrases with each other or with other words or phrases, and other grammatical forms of such words and phrases (including verb, adjective, gerund, participle, and infinitive forms)." The bill omitted "tits", but included "asshole", which was not one of Carlins original seven words. The bill was referred to the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution in January 2004, where it was tabled.<ref name=":0" />

Carlin performed regularly as a headliner in Las Vegas Valley Las Vegas, but in 2004 his run at the MGM Grand Las Vegas was terminated after an altercation with his audience. After a poorly received set, filled with dark references to suicide bombings and beheadings, Carlin complained that he could not wait to get out of "this fucking hotel" and Las Vegas; he wanted to go back east, he said, "where the real people are." He continued:
{{quotation People who go to Las Vegas, youve got to question their fucking intellect to start with. Traveling hundreds and thousands of miles to essentially give your money to a large corporation is kind of fucking moronic. Thats what Im always getting here is these kind of fucking people with very limited intellects.}}
When an audience member shouted "Stop degrading us!" Carlin responded "Thank you very much, whatever that was. I hope it was positive; if not, well, blow me." He was immediately fired, and soon thereafter his representative announced that he would begin treatment for alcohol and prescription painkiller addiction on his own initiative.<ref name="tagreviewj">{{cite web  url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-04-Sat-2004/news/25407915.html  title=Dark Carlin  publisher=reviewjournal.com  date=December 4, 2004  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207042940/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-04-Sat-2004/news/25407915.html  archivedate=December 7, 2004  accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/books/12/27/george.carlin/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ  title=George Carlin enters rehab  publisher=CNN  date=December 29, 2004  accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref>

== Internet hoaxes ==
Many writings found on the internet have been falsely attributed to Carlin, including various joke lists, rants, and other pieces. The web site Snopes, an online resource that debunks urban legends and myths, has addressed these hoaxes. Many of them contain material that runs counter to Carlins viewpoints; some are especially volatile toward racial groups, gays, women, the homeless, and other targets. Carlin was aware of these bogus emails and debunked them on his own web site, saying, "Heres a rule of thumb, folks: Nothing you see on the Internet is mine unless it comes from one of my albums, books, HBO specials, or appeared on my web site", and "It bothers me that some people might believe that I would be capable of writing some of this stuff." Weird Al Yankovic referenced these hoaxes in a line of his song "Alpocalypse#Track listing Stop Forwarding That Crap to Me" by saying "And by the way, those quotes from George Carlin arent really George Carlin".<ref>
