Although Andy Clydes movie career spanned 45 years, he may be best known for his work as California Carlson in the Hopalong Cassidy movie series.

==Early years==

In 1912, Clyde first came to the United States on tour in a company performing a play called The Concealed Bed. Years later, at the invitation of his close friend James Finlayson (actor) James Finlayson, he returned to the United States in 1920 to join producer Mack Sennetts roster of comedians.<ref name=hht>[http://www.helensburgh-heritage.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=710:andy-clyde-film-star&catid=81:the-arts&Itemid=458 Andy Clyde: Film star], Helensburgh Heritage.

Clydes mastery of makeup allowed him tremendous versatility; he could play everything from grubby young guttersnipes to old Crank (person) crackpot scientists. He hit upon an "Old age old man" characterization in his Short film short Comedy film comedies, and the masquerade was immediately successful. Adopting a gray wig and Moustache mustache, he used this makeup for the rest of his short-subject career, and the character was so durable that he literally grew into it. He starred in short comedies longer than any other actor (32 years, 1924â€“56).

He made a successful transition to sound films while in Mack Sennetts employ. In 1932, when the Sennett studio was facing financial problems, Sennett cut Clydes salary. Clyde objected and Sennett put the "old man" costume on character actor Irving Bacon. Audiences reacted adversely, and Sennett abandoned the character. Educational Pictures, Sennetts distributor, took over the Andy Clyde series, which continued for two more years.

Columbia Pictures launched its short subject department in 1934 and Andy Clyde was one of the first comedy stars signed by producer Jules White. Unlike many of the Columbia short-subject comedians who indulged in broad facial and physical gestures, Clyde was subtler and more economical: his comic timing was so good that he could merely lift an eyebrow, shudder slightly, or mutter "My, my, my" for humorous effect. His work for Columbia was prolific enough that, from the mid-1940s, the studio was able to produce lower-budgeted remakes, editing older scenes into the new ones. You Were Never Uglier (1944), for example, was remade with the same principals in 1953 as Hooked and Rooked. Clyde was such an audience favorite that he continued to star in Columbia shorts through 1956. He outlasted every comedian on the Columbia payroll except The Three Stooges.<ref name=Okuda>Okuda, Ted; Watz, Edward; (1986).
