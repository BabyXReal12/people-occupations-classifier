Michael Alfred "Mike" Warnke (born November 19, 1946) is an American Christianity Christian Evangelism evangelist and comedian. With the success of his books and recordings, Warnke became one of evangelical Christianitys best-known experts on the subject of Satanism during the 1980s, before his claims of having been a Satanist high priest were discredited in 1991 by the Christian magazine, Cornerstone (magazine) Cornerstone.

==Early life==
Mike Warnke was born in 1946 to parents Alfred "Al" Warnke and Louise Warnke. When he was five years old, the Warnke family moved to Manchester, Tennessee where his father opened a truck stop. In 1955, Warnkes mother was killed in a car accident. In 1958 his father died, leaving Warnke an orphan. After the death of his father, Warnke was taken to live with two of his aunts in Sparta, Tennessee, and from there to his fathers half-sister and her husband in San Bernardino County, California San Bernardino, California. In June 1965, Warnke graduated from Rim of the World High School in Lake Arrowhead, California Lake Arrowhead. That September, he enrolled at San Bernardino Valley College but withdrew after one semester, whereupon by his account, Warnke began his tenure as a Satanist. On June 2, 1966, Warnke enlisted in the United States Navy. After graduating from boot-camp on August 22, 1966, Warnkes assigned military occupational specialty was as a hospital corpsman.<ref name=cornerstone-expose>{{cite journal url =http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/sellingsatan.htm  title = Selling Satan  work = Cornerstone  issue=98  year=1992  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629063019/http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/sellingsatan.htm  archivedate=2011-06-29}}</ref>

According to the account of his life in the Satan Seller, Warnke Conversion to Christianity converted to Christianity during navy recruit training boot camp.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/> However, high-school acquaintance Charlotte Tweeten has stated she recalls him proclaiming faith in Christ in the year prior to his navy enlistment in 1966.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/> Warnke also wrote that he began dating fellow Rim of the World High School alumna, Sue Studer, during this time period. This has been disproven, however, and Warnke was actually engaged to Lois Eckenrod at this time.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/> In 1967, Warnke completed naval corpsman training, returned to San Diego, and married Studer.  Together, they had two children.<ref name=warnke-response>{{cite web  url = http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/warnke_response/csr0009a.htm  date=1992-07-15  title = Warnkes statement in response to Cornerstones claims  work = Cornerstone  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629063109/http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/warnke_response/csr0009a.htm  archivedate=2011-06-29}}</ref>

In 1969, Warnke was deployed to Vietnam War Vietnam for a six-month tour of duty.<ref name=cornerstone-vietnam>Cornerstone, issue 98: "Records show Warnke was in Vietnam for only six months"</ref>  Having been wounded in battle during those six months, Warnke was awarded the Purple Heart. Warnkes own written accounts differ on the number of times he sustained injuries during his time in Vietnam. In The Satan Seller, Warnke says he was wounded twice, while in his second book, Hitchhiking on Hope Street, he states he was wounded five times. Despite these wounds received during his tour of duty as a hospital corpsman, second class,  Warnkes various accounts have him spending much time detained, allegedly killing a man in battle, and surviving being shot several times, including once by an arrow. Warnke says it was the latter wound for which he was awarded the Purple Heart.<ref>Hey Doc recording. Word Records</ref> Warnke returned to the United States in 1970.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/>

While still serving in the navy, Warnke teamed up with San Diego Evangelism evangelist Morris Cerullo and was touted for his "Satanist experience". Warnke and Cerullo toured the country participating in charismatic revival meetings. Cerullo wanted to write a book about youth occultism, and assigned the writing task to David Balsiger with help from Warnke. In early 1972, Warnke requested and received an early discharge from the navy as a conscientious objector so that he could work full-time in the ministry. Warnke then left Cerullos ministry to start his own, forbidding Cerullo to use any of his material. It was at this time that Warnke and Balsiger went on to write the book that would make Warnke famous.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/>

==Rise to fame==

===The Satan Seller===
In 1972, Warnkes book The Satan Seller was released. Written by Warnke, with help from Balsiger and Les Jones (author) Les Jones, the book tells of Warnke being orphaned as a child and his introduction into Satanism. Further detailed is Warnkes participation in sexual orgies, alcoholism, and drug dealing; his rise in the ranks of Satanism to the level of "high priest"; presiding over Satanic rituals including magical spells, summoning demons, ritual sex including a ritual kidnap and rape; the attempt on his life &mdash; a heroin overdose &mdash; that left him angry and disillusioned; his heroism in Vietnam; and how he found Jesus and came home as an evangelist. The story ends with Warnke living happily in California with wife Sue Studer. In fewer than three months after the release, The Satan Seller had become a religious best-seller.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/>

The book launched Warnke into stardom within Evangelicalism evangelical Christian communities. He became a popular speaker at Christian meeting places such as Melodyland in Anaheim, California Anaheim, California. In 1974, Warnke moved his family to attend Trinity Bible College in Tulsa, Oklahoma Tulsa, Oklahoma, as a nine-month preparation for ministry. It was here, while among other Charismatic movement charismatic Christians and recent converts preparing for a life of ministry, that Warnke met Carolyn Alberty and the two began a sexual affair.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/><!-- LEAVE CITATION IN--> Warnke also met Elijah Coady, an episcopi vagantes independent, schismatic bishop of the Syro-Chaldean Church, also known as the Assyrian Church of the East or the Nestorian church. Coady ordained Warnke as a deacon. Upon graduation, Warnke was again ordained, and Warnke moved with his family to Denver, Colorado Denver, Colorado.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/>

During the 1980s, Warnkes ministry prospered, as Warnke and his new wife toured and performed together, raising millions of dollars for their ministry. Contributions to the ministry were over $1 million in 1985, and over $2 million each year from 1987 through 1990.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/><!--facts checked; Cornerstone obtained HOCCK filings and cited them in article {{Citation needed date=March 2007}}--> As the Warnkes popularity waxed, their personal relationship waned.

Six weeks after the divorce was finalized, Warnke married Rim of the World High School alumna Susan Patton.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/>

===Extravagant claims===
In 1982, Warnke began to exaggerate his achievements. During the 1980s, Warnkes claims of academic degrees increased from two Bachelors degrees to two Masters Degrees to a Doctorate of Philosophy.<!--As stated on Higher Education {{Citation needed date=March 2007}} --> In The Satan Seller, Warnke says he was wounded twice while in Vietnam. In Hitchhiking on Hope Street, he said he had been wounded five times.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/> Warnke followed up his interest in the Syro-Chaldean tradition and his 1970s ordination as a deacon with a 1983 ordination by independent bishop Richard Morrill, lately of the Byzantine Catholic Church, Inc. This ordination allowed Warnke to call himself bishop.<ref name=cornerstone-expose/>

===National exposure===
On May 16, 1985, Warnke appeared in a prime-time news report about Satanism on American Broadcasting Company ABCs 20/20 (US television series) 20/20. In the shows episode titled "The Devil Worshippers", Warnke was included in a number of segments where he discussed the implements and clothing used in Satanic ceremonies, a scar allegedly indicating where he was repeatedly cut so that his blood could be used in Satanic ceremonies, and what drew him to Satanism.<ref name="ABC">{{cite news  title = The Devil Worshippers  work =  publisher = ABC News 20/20 transcript, show #521  date = May 16, 1985}}</ref> After Warnkes appearance on 20/20, he was frequently cited as an expert on the occult by Christian radio host Bob Larson and the Chick Publications stable of authors.

==Investigation and debunking==
In 1991, Cornerstone (magazine) Cornerstone magazine launched an investigation into Warnkes life and testimony. The previous year, Cornerstone had debunked Laurel Rose Willson Lauren Stratfords story that had been recounted in Satans Underground. Stratford claimed her deep involvement in Satanism led her to partake in a ritual in which her own child was human sacrifice sacrificed. After the exposé showed Stratfords alleged child had never existed, Cornerstone journalists Mike Hertenstein and Jon Trott investigated Warnke and his life.

The Cornerstone investigation spanned from interviews with over 100 of Warnkes personal friends and acquaintances to his ministrys tax receipts. The investigation revealed a number of inaccuracies and evidence of fraud and deceit in Warnkes accounts. During the course of Cornerstones investigation, pictures of Warnke taken during the time he was alleged to be a Satanist priest were discovered. Rather than showing an emaciated drug-addict sporting long fingernails and waist-length hair, the pictures showed Warnke as a typical square of the mid-1960s. The investigation also revealed Warnkes claims that he and Charles Manson had attended a Satanic ritual to be false; Manson was in federal prison at the time, having no known ties to Satanic churches.

The investigation further uncovered that before joining the Navy, Warnke had been involved with the college Christian ministry Campus Crusade for Christ. The investigation also revealed the unflattering circumstances surrounding Warnkes multiple marriages, affairs, and divorces. Most critically, however, the investigation showed how Warnke could not have done the many things he claimed to have taken part in throughout the nine months he claimed to be a Satanist - including his claims to be a drug-addicted dealer or a Satanic high priest.<ref name=cornerstone-dates>{{cite journal url = http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/dates.htm  title = Why the Dates Dont Work (sidebar)  work = Cornerstone  issue=98  year=1992  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629063030/http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss098/dates.htm  archivedate=2011-06-29}}</ref>

Before publishing the article, Cornerstone contacted Warnke for an interview, but he and Cornerstone could not agree to the terms of an interview.<ref name=warnke-response/><ref name=cornerstone-update/> In June 1992, at the annual CBA (Christian trade association) Christian Booksellers Association convention, Cornerstone revealed its story.

==Aftermath==
Warnke sent a response to Cornerstone,<ref name=warnke-response/> published in July, insisting he told the truth, stating:
{{blockquote I stand by my testimony of being delivered and set free by the power of Jesus Christ after being a Satanic high priest exactly as published in my book, The Satan Seller.... some information was purposefully changed to protect the privacy of certain individuals and to prevent readers from using the book as a guide for occultism and Satanic purposes. But, as we stated in the front of the book, The events are absolutely as described.}} Despite these assertions, Warnke did not provide the name of a single Satanist but used invectives against ex-wife Carolyn.<ref name=warnke-response/> In the ensuing months, Warnke conceded parts of the allegations, telling Christianity Today that there had been only 13 members of his coven, not 1,500 as originally claimed, and that of those 13, the whereabouts of five were unknown to him, while the other eight had since died.<ref name="lied">Jay Grelen. "Christian comedian says he lied about coven", Lexington Herald-Leader, November 3, 1992, page B1.</ref>

Public response was varied but was nevertheless overwhelmingly against Warnke.<ref name=cornerstone-update>{{cite journal url = http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss099/warnke_update.htm  title = Warnke Update  issue=99  work = Cornerstone  year=1992  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629063024/http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss099/warnke_update.htm  archivedate=2011-06-29}}</ref> Initially, Word Records stated that they would stand by their artist. However, further investigations by local Kentucky reporters at the Lexington Herald-Leader revealed that Warnkes ministry had engaged in financial misdeeds and that "Mike, his ex-wife Rose, and her brother Neale [Hall] received a total of $809,680 in salary at a time when the ministry newsletter claimed donations were down and more funds were needed."<ref name=cornerstone-update/> One week later, Word Records dropped Warnke from its label. Finally, on September 30, 1992, fewer than 100 days after the investigation was made public, Warnke Ministries closed its doors.<ref name="grelen">Jay Grelen. "Christian comedian set to close doors of troubled ministry", Lexington Herald-Leader (KY), September 30, 1992, page C13.</ref>

In the spring of 1993, Warnke submitted to the authority of an assembly of ministers "acting as elders", acknowledging his "ungodliness", his "multiple divorces", his "failure as husband, father, and friend", and of "embellishment and exaggeration ... in an attempt ... to entertain", and offering to pay back taxes to the federal government. The group recommended specific changes to the ministry, including a salary cap and accountability reports.<ref name="okla2000">Tamie Ross.
