==Early life==
Corddry was born and raised in Weymouth, Massachusetts. He is the son of Robin (née Sullivan) and Steven Corddry, who was a Massachusetts Port Authority official.
He is the older brother of actor Nate Corddry. He has a younger sister, Laura Corddry, who is an administrator at Southern New Hampshire University. Corddry and his brother are both Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America) Eagle Scouts from Troop 19, located in Weymouth.
After graduating from Weymouth North High School (1989), Corddry went to the University of Massachusetts Amherst (1989–93). According to an interview in the UMass Amherst alumnus alumni magazine, Corddry initially planned to major in journalism, but he stuck with it for just two days. English became his official major. By his second year, he focused much of his attention on Drama classes and plays including Torch Song Trilogy, And Then There Were None Ten Little Indians, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Romeo and Juliet, and Reckless (play) Reckless. While at UMass, Corddry pledged the Theta Chapter of Theta Chi fraternity.

In January 1994, Corddry moved to New York City. His early paying jobs included working as a security guard at The Metropolitan Museum of Art
and handing out menus for a Mexican cuisine Mexican restaurant. He eventually landed acting jobs, including a year-long tour with the National Shakespeare Conservatory National Shakespeare Company. He trained in Improvisational theatre improv at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City, performing regularly as a member of the sketch comedy group "The Naked Babies" (with John Ross Bowie, Brian Huskey, and Seth Morris); and he spent two years with the sketch comedy group "Third Rail Comedy". Corddrys first notable television appearances were on Comedy Centrals Upright Citizens Brigade (1998–2000).

==The Daily Show==
In Spring 2002, he accepted an audition for The Daily Show. His pieces for The Daily Show frequently included references to Boston, Massachusetts, which he considers to be his hometown. On October 4, 2005, his younger brother Nate Corddry made his first appearance as a Daily Show journalist correspondent. On January 12, 2006, Corddrys wife Sandra appeared with him on a Daily Show segment; they welcomed their first child, daughter Sloane Sullivan Corddry, on July 3, 2006. On February 9, 2006 Corddry hosted an episode of The Daily Show due to the absence of Jon Stewart (jokingly because the shows regular host was "Plastic surgery in the shop", but in fact because of the birth of Stewarts second child).{{Citation needed date=April 2009}}

On August 15, 2006, Corddry said "Ive got like a week and a half left, all bets are off", and then on August 21, 2006, Stewart remarked that Corddrys last day on The Daily Show would be August 24, 2006. Corddry appeared throughout the week, once filing a report from inside a toilet bowl supposedly on board an aircraft transporting John Mark Karr, and another dressed up in a 1970s in fashion 1970s fashion; Stewart remarked, "Its his last week, and really, were trying to come up with terrible things for him to have to do."

During that last show on August 24, Corddry aired a self-produced tribute to his four years on the show, going out, as Stewart said, with a "Toilet humour poop joke".
<blockquote>
 <poem>
  Stewart: That was a very fitting tribute, Rob. Were gonna miss you on the show.
Corddry: Why thank you, Jon. But wherever I go and whatever I do, therell always be a part of me here.
Stewart: Wow...thats a really sweet thing to say.
Corddry: No no no, Im not kidding. Its in the second floor mens room, actually. Thats what you get for not giving me a proper send off.
Stewart: Youre really gonna go out on a poop joke?
Corddry: I have to stay true to myself, Jon.
 </poem>
</blockquote>
Corddry cites Stewart as a profound influence on his comedy, crediting Stewart for teaching him how to focus on an idea in order to find the humor in it, and says that his The Daily Show pedigree earned him the clout to make Childrens Hospital.
