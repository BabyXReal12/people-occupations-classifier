Blue emigrated to Baltimore, Maryland at the age of nine, where he won a contest for the best impersonation of Charlie Chaplin. At the age of fifteen he was in a touring company and later became a stage manager and assistant general manager. He became a dance instructor and nightclub proprietor. In the 1920s Blue joined a popular orchestra, Jack White and His Montrealers. The entire band emphasized comedy, and would continually interact with the joke-cracking maestro. Blue, the drummer, would sometimes deliver corny jokes while wearing a ridiculously false beard. The band emigrated to the United States, and appeared in two early sound musicals&nbsp;— the Vitaphone short subject Jack White and His Montrealers and Universals feature-length Technicolor 2-strip Technicolor revue King of Jazz (1930).

In 1930, Blue toured with the "Earl Carroll Vanities".

Blue left the band to establish himself as a solo comedian, portraying a bald-headed dumb-bell with a goofy expression. Producer Hal Roach featured him in his "Taxi Boys" comedy shorts, but Blues dopey character was an acquired taste and he was soon replaced by other comedians. Later in the 1930s he worked at Paramount Pictures, notably in The Big Broadcast of 1938, and later at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, in films such as Easy to Wed.

He was divorced by his first wife in 1937.<ref>{{cite news  author=  title=Ben Blue Is Sued by Wife  url=https://www.nytimes.com/1937/11/06/archives/ben-blue-is-sued-by-wife.html  quote=  newspaper=The New York Times  date=November 6, 1937 }}</ref> He was ordered to pay $600 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation US 600 1937 r=-3}}}} today) monthly alimony.
