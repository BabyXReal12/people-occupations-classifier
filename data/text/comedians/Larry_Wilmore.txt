===The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore===
{{main article The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore}}
On January 19, 2015 Wilmore began hosting The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, a Late night television late-night Panel discussion panel Late-night talk show talk show that aired on Comedy Central. It was a Spin-off (media) spin-off of The Daily Show, and served as a replacement for The Colbert Report. It was produced by Jon Stewarts production company Busboy Productions. The show was criticized for a controversial segment featuring Bill Nye in September 2015, with Adweek characterizing it as the moment that Wilmore had "turned away from Colberts legacy of intellectualism." The Nye segment may have negatively affected viewership, with ratings down more than half from the year before.<ref>{{cite news  last=Griner  first=David  url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/was-moment-larry-wilmore-lost-stephen-colberts-intellectual-appeal-169712  title=Larry Wilmores Ratings Are 55% Lower Than The Colbert Report, and This Clip May Prove Why  work=Adweek  date=2016-02-16  accessdate=2016-02-27 }}</ref> On August 15, 2016, Comedy Central announced that Wilmores show had been cancelled.

In June 2017, Wilmore came under fire for comments he had made during his time on The Nightly Show. When reporting on the case of Otto Warmbier, an American student arrested in North Korea and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly attempting to steal a propaganda sign, Wilmore repeatedly ridiculed Warmbier.  Wilmore referred to Warmbier as "Otto Von Crybaby" and suggested that Warmbier thought he had "Frat Bro Privilege".  Otto Warmbier died on June 19, 2017, after being medically evacuated from North Korea to the U.S. in a comatose state, after 15 months in prison.<ref>{{cite news  last=Fondacaro  first=Nicholas  url=http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/nicholas-fondacaro/2017/06/19/flashback-comedy-central-huffpo-mocked-capture-otto-warmbier  title=FLASHBACK: Comedy Central, HuffPo Mocked Capture of Otto Warmbier  work=Media Research Center  date=19 June 2017  accessdate=24 June 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news  last=Rosenberg  first=Ayssa  url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2017/06/21/what-we-can-learn-from-the-harshest-responses-to-otto-warmbiers-captivity/  title=What we can learn from the harshest responses to Otto Warmbier’s captivity  work=Washington Post  date=21 June 2017  accessdate=24 June 2017 }}</ref> In his Black on the Air podcast on June 22, 2017, Wilmore offered an apology for his earlier remarks about Warmbier.<ref name="Wilstein">{{cite news  last1=Wilstein  first1=Matt  title=Larry Wilmore Apologizes to Otto Warmbier’s Family  url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/larry-wilmore-apologizes-to-otto-warmbiers-family  work=The Daily Beast  date=June 22, 2017  language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  last1=Wilmore  first1=Larry  title=The Situation in North Korea, Patriotism vs. Criticism, and Kumail Nanjiani on Arranged Marriages and ‘The Big Sick’ (Ep. 6)  url=https://art19.com/shows/larry-wilmore/episodes/dd0cbf1c-5fc1-4858-b65a-c69bbcfbde89  website=Black on the Air publisher=ART19  date=June 22, 2017}}</ref>
