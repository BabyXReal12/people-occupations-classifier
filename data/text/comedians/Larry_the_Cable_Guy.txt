==Career==

===Radio career===
Whitney started his career in radio in the early 1990s when he made regular radio appearances on the nationally syndicated program, Ron and Ron The Ron and Ron Show, as well as other radio shows such as "The Bob and Tom show" The Chris Baker Show on KDGE and KEZOs The Todd and Tyler Show in Omaha, Nebraska Omaha, Nebraska, as well as the Kirk, Mark_Ondayko Mark, and R._Edward_Lopez Lopez morning show on WIYY in Baltimore, Maryland. He was also a frequent guest on The Johnny Dare Morning Show on 98.9/KQRC, Kansas City, Missouri Kansas City.

===Stand-up career===

Initially performing stand-up under his real name with limited success, he became famous after developing the Cable Guy character, a personality that he now maintains throughout his stage act. The Cable Guy character has a stereotypical redneck appearance and a thick Southern accent, recounts stories about his "family", and uses, among other common expressions, his own catchphrase "Git-R-Done!".

He says in interviews and in his autobiographical book GIT-R-DONE that he deliberately "turns on" the accent both on and off stage, because he may forget it if he kept his normal accent intact.
He uses catchphrase humor, including "Lord, I apologize, and be with the starvin Pygmies in New Guinea. Amen" after telling  jokes of questionable taste; and, "I dont care who ya are, thats funny right there" after jokes that evoke raucous laughter.

His first two comedy albums, Lord, I Apologize (2001) and The Right to Bare Arms (2005), have both been RIAA certification certified gold album gold by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA. A third album, Morning Constitutions, and its accompanying TV special were released in 2007.

==Personal life==
Whitney resides in Lincoln, Nebraska, on a {{convert 180 acre adj=on}} farm. On July 3, 2005, he married his wife, Cara. They have two children together: a son named Wyatt (born August 2, 2006) and a daughter named Reagan (born October 29, 2007). His hometown of Pawnee City, Nebraska has a street named after him. Whitney also donated money to buy new theatrical equipment for the local high school.
Whitney is an avid Nebraska Cornhuskers football fan. His signature camouflage hat has the University of Nebraska-Lincoln nickname "HUSKERS" emblazoned on it which can be seen in the 2007 film Delta Farce. He is also frequently seen with a gold Nebraska "N"  on a chain around his neck. On October 1, 2016, in his luxury suite at Memorial Stadium (Lincoln) Memorial Stadium during the Nebraska vs. Illinois football game, Whitney was challenged to an arm wrestling match by an United States Army Army veteran and Nebraska Army National Guard member, John O’Connell, who lost the match in less than one minute with his arm (humerus) broken by Whitney.

In September 2010, Whitney donated $5 million to the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, Florida. The gift was for further development of the International Hip Dysplasia Institute at the Orlando hospital. After Dr. Chad Price at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children helped cure their son, Wyatt, of his Hip dysplasia (human) dysplasia when he was an infant, Whitney and his wife, Cara, made private donations to the hospital and Whitney raised money through appearances on Family Feud and Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?. 

The hospital opened a new wing called the "Wyatt Whitney Wing" in May 2012.
Whitney is a close friend of contemporary comedian Lewis Black, despite dissimilar political views, background, and material they perform in their stand-up routines.
