==Career==

===Radio career===
Whitney started his career in radio in the early 1990s when he made regular radio appearances on the nationally syndicated program, Ron and Ron The Ron and Ron Show, as well as other radio shows such as "The Bob and Tom show" The Chris Baker Show on KDGE and KEZOs The Todd and Tyler Show in Omaha, Nebraska Omaha, Nebraska, as well as the Kirk, Mark_Ondayko Mark, and R._Edward_Lopez Lopez morning show on WIYY in Baltimore, Maryland. He was also a frequent guest on The Johnny Dare Morning Show on 98.9/KQRC, Kansas City, Missouri Kansas City. 

He also appeared on WJRR in Orlando, Florida Orlando, Florida. He was brought to New England on Greg and the Morning Buzz on WHEB 100.3 and WGIR-FM 101.1 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire Portsmouth and Manchester, New Hampshire Manchester, New Hampshire, respectively, doing two commentaries a week.

===Stand-up career===

Initially performing stand-up under his real name with limited success, he became famous after developing the Cable Guy character, a personality that he now maintains throughout his stage act. The Cable Guy character has a stereotypical redneck appearance and a thick Southern accent, recounts stories about his "family", and uses, among other common expressions, his own catchphrase "Git-R-Done!".

He says in interviews and in his autobiographical book GIT-R-DONE that he deliberately "turns on" the accent both on and off stage, because he may forget it if he kept his normal accent intact.<ref name="deadfrog">[http://www.dead-frog.com/blog/entry/an_interview_with_larry_the_cable_guy/ An Interview with Larry the Cable Guy], Dead-Frog.com, June 15, 2005</ref> He uses catchphrase humor, including "Lord, I apologize, and be with the starvin Pygmies in New Guinea. Amen" after telling  jokes of questionable taste; and, "I dont care who ya are, thats funny right there" after jokes that evoke raucous laughter.

His first two comedy albums, Lord, I Apologize (2001) and The Right to Bare Arms (2005), have both been RIAA certification certified gold album gold by the Recording Industry Association of America RIAA. A third album, Morning Constitutions, and its accompanying TV special were released in 2007.
