As well as stand up, Kitson has written and performed "story shows". The first was A Made Up Story at the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe,<ref name="Guardian2003">{{cite news  url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/jul/27/edinburghfestival2003.features  title= The Guardian: I want to tell you a story.  accessdate= 12 May 2009  location=London  first=Stephanie  last=Merritt  date=27 July 2003}}</ref> followed by Stories For the Wobbly-Hearted at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2005. The latter show opened at the Traverse Theatre for the 2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe and won a Scotsman Fringe First Award. In 2006, Kitson took Stories for the Wobbly Hearted to the Brits Off Broadway Festival in New York.<ref>[http://www.britsoffbroadway.com/wobbly_stories.htm Wobbly Stories]</ref> In June 2006 the story show made up one half of his Regents Park Open Air Theatre appearance, where Kitsons stories were accompanied by songs from Gavin Osborn. His story show, C-90, opened at the Traverse for the 2006 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. It was awarded both a Fringe First and The Stage Stage Awards for Acting Excellence Acting Award for Best Solo Show.

In 2007, Kitson toured Its The Fireworks Talking and the story show C-90 in the UK, Australia, New York and Paris. There was a second Open Air Theatre show in June 2007. Kitson also complemented his Australian tour of C-90 with a loosely structured stand up show titled At 10&nbsp;pm, Daniel Kitson Will Be Drinking Tea and Blowing Minds, a reference to a line from the movie Dazed and Confused (film) Dazed and Confused.

Its The Fireworks Talking won Kitson the Barry Award (for comedy) Barry Award – named after veteran Australian comedian Barry Humphries – at the 2007 Melbourne International Comedy Festival. C90 was awarded an Brighton and Hove Argus Argus Angel Award at the 2007 Brighton Festival.

In the first half of 2008 Kitson toured his show The Impotent Fury of the Privileged. He played work-in progress gigs in January and early February before presenting the show at 28 dates during May & June. The show was released as an audio download in January 2017.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2017/01/16/26630/at_last..._daniel_kitson_releases_his_2008_show title=At last...

In 2009 Kitson performed two new shows: We Are Gathered Here & The Interminable Suicide of Gregory Church, the latter of which was toured in late 2010 and the first half of 2011. Prior to this in early 2010, Kitson also did a short UK tour of 66a Church Road  – A Lament Made of Memories and Kept in Suitcases that he initially performed in Edinburgh in 2008 (and then took to Australia.)

In January 2012, his show "It’s Always Right Now, Until it’s Later" played at the St. Anns Warehouse in Brooklyn, NY.

In March 2012, Kitson took a brand new stand-up show, Where Once Was Wonder, on a work-in-progress tour around the UK before touring it in Australia and returning for the Edinburgh Fringe in August. The new show comprises all new material and is made up of three stories about "the impossible".<ref name=BristolTimes>{{cite web url=http://bristoltimes.com/theatre-and-films/daniel-kitson-where-once-was-wonder-work-in-progress-tobacco-factory-060312  title= Bristol Times: Daniel Kitson – Where Once Was Wonder (WiP) @ Tobacco Factory  accessdate= 12 March 2012  publisher=BristolTimes.com}}</ref>

In 2013 he took his new stand-up show entitled After the Beginning. Before the End on a UK tour and also played a few European dates.

Kitson debuted his new play Mouse: The Persistence of an Unlikely Thought at Liverpool Everyman in 2016. <ref>https://www.everymanplayhouse.com/whats-on/mouse-the-persistence-of-an-unlikely-thought</ref>

Kitson appeared in an episode of That Peter Kay Thing, That Peter Kay Thing#The Arena The Arena, and as the recurring character Characters in Phoenix Nights#Spencer Spencer in Peter Kays Phoenix Nights.

In 2007 clips of Daniel Kitsons standup were shown on the one-off Channel 4 show 100 Greatest Stand-Ups where he came 27th.<ref name="100GS">{{cite web  url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0996593/  title= 100 hundred greatest standups. IMDB.  accessdate= 12 May 2009}}</ref> In an updated version of the poll in 2010, he was voted 23rd. Chris Addison commented that Kitson is the finest comedian of his generation. Stewart Lee also commented, after seeing a stand-up set by Kitson, that he saw stand-up about as good as it could get.

Whilst in his teens, he appeared as a contestant on the ITV quiz show Blockbusters (UK game show) Blockbusters.<ref name="IMBDbio">{{cite web  url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1146744/bio  title= IMDB biography of Daniel Kitson.  accessdate= 12 May 2009}}</ref>

Kitson voices an "alley rat" in the pilot episode of the Kristen Schaal and Kurt Braunohler comedy "Penelope: Princess of Pets" which was aired in 2010 by Channel 4.<ref name="Apiary">{{cite web  url=http://www.theapiary.org/archives/2009/05/penelope_prince_2.html  title= The Apiary – Penelope: Princess of Pets Pilot.  accessdate= 22 July 2009}}</ref><ref name="BCG">{{cite web  url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/penelope_princess_of_pets  title= British Comedy Guide – Penelope: Princess of Pets.  accessdate= 22 July 2009}}</ref>

==Radio==
In 2006, Kitson began presenting his own weekly music-based radio show called The Listening Club. The show, broadcast live 1&nbsp;am to 4&nbsp;am on Monday nights / Tuesday mornings from Londons community arts radio station Resonance FM, mainly involves music from his own collection (some played directly from his iPod), and occasional clips of comedy. In between tracks he talks about the music, tells anecdotes, and responds to the SMS text messages and e-mails that are sent in throughout the show. There were six shows in the original January / February 2006 run, with further installments in October 2006 and February 2007. Kitson returned to Resonance FM in early 2013 on Tuesdays from midnight to 2:30&nbsp;am. The show is only broadcast once with no repeat or accompanying podcast to ensure that audiences hear the show only once to make it more special, he also requests that no one record the show. The show returned in September 2016 under the title "Captain Bang Bangs Magic Castle" for a run of five weeks. This run of shows was subject to a number of mishaps which resulted in Kitson only broadcasting for one hour of the fifth show due to missing his train and missing the entire final show due to not being able to enter the Resonance FM radio station. As with the original run the show was not archived or repeated. In 2018 it was announced that for three weeks in May, Kitson would host an early morning weekday show on Resonance FM called “A Reason To Wake Up”. 

Kitson had originally begun doing radio shows in Australia during the 2005 Melbourne International Comedy Festival, on Melbourne-based community station 3RRR. These continued, twice weekly, in 2006 and 2007. The Australian programmes are usually co-hosted with a comedian friend. Co-hosts have included Courteney Hocking, David ODoherty, Andrew McClelland and Steve Hall of We Are Klang.

He has appeared on the BBC Radio 4 show Loose Ends (radio) Loose Ends.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2208132.stm   title= BBC Protests greet male Perrier shortlist article.  accessdate= 13 May 2009  date=21 August 2002  work=BBC News}}</ref>

Kitson appears in Episode 2 of the Flight of the Conchords radio series.

He also can be heard on the BBC Radio 4 Program, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b072n5xc Tim Key Delves Into Daniil Kharms and Thats All]<ref name="radio2">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/comedy/conchords.shtml BBC Radio 2 Comedy]</ref>
