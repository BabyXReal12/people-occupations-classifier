In 2015, she departed the show after 12 years to start her own show, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee.

Bee became a US citizen in 2014, while retaining her Canadian citizenship. In 2017, Time (magazine) Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world on their annual Time 100 Time 100 list.

==Early life and education==
Bee was born in Toronto, Ontario, the daughter of Debra and Ronald Bee.
She has said of her family: "Dating from well before the turn of the 20th century, if there has ever been a successful, happy marriage in my family lineage, Ive yet to hear about it."
Bees parents split up soon after her birth, and she was initially raised by her grandmother, who worked as a secretary at the Catholic school Bee attended,
on Roncesvalles Avenue during her childhood. She attended Humberside Collegiate Institute and York Memorial Collegiate Institute.
After graduating from high school, Bee attended McGill University, where she studied humanities. Dissatisfied with a range of issues at the school, she transferred to the University of Ottawa after her first year. At the University of Ottawa, Bee signed up for a theatre class thinking it would be easy. The class led to Bee discovering her love of performing.
Bee later enrolled in the George Brown Theatre School in Toronto.
==Career==

===Career beginnings===
Bee started auditioning for acting roles in Toronto while working as a waitress.
At age 26, Bee toured with a stage production of Sailor Moon where she played the titular role.
Bee performed in Sailor Moons "A" cast and future husband Jason Jones (actor) Jason Jones was a member of the "B" cast.
Bee was one of the four founding members of Toronto-based sketch comedy troupe The Atomic Fireballs.
The Fireballs were all women. Demonstrating mutual support, the group would try to perform as many of each others ideas as they could.
===2003–2014: The Daily Show===
Bee became a correspondent for Daily Show The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on July 10, 2003.
Bee was the sole female correspondent on The Daily Show from her debut in 2003 until Kristen Schaal joined the show in March 2008. She was The Daily Show{{}}s first non-US citizen correspondent.
On that program, Bee demonstrated an ability to coax people into caricaturing themselves—particularly in segments like "Kill Drill", on hunters and fossil fuel executives claiming to be environmentalists;
"They So Horny?",
on the dearth of Asian people Asian men in U.S. pornography; "Tropical Repression", on Ed Heeney, a Florida politician running his campaign based on opposition to gay rights;
"The Undecided", an over-the-top look at the undecided voters leading up to the United States presidential election, 2004 2004 US presidential elections; the "Samantha Bees So You Want To Bee A..." report series, which humorously caricatured the way in which one can easily obtain a certain job, like becoming a 527 group; and a segment entitled "NILFs" ("News Id Like to F#@k"), discussing the sexiness of news anchors: "CNN has the wholesome girl-next-door NILFs, the kind you can bring home to meet your mother. MSNBC has the dirty-over-30 NILFs. Fox News Fox has the filthy NILFs who will report anything. Theyre the Hustler of NILFs."
She had her first starring role in a feature film in 2004 with the Canadian independent film Ham &amp; Cheese, co-written by her husband Jason Jones (actor) Jason Jones and starring Canadian comics Scott Thompson (comedian) Scott Thompson and Dave Foley.
The film marked Bees first starring role.
She won a Canadian Comedy Awards Canadian Comedy Award for "Pretty Funny Female Performance" for her role.

Jones became a freelance correspondent for the show while Bee reduced her workload during her pregnancy.

In December 2005, on The OReilly Factor, Bill OReilly (commentator) Bill OReilly used a clip of Bee from The Daily Show as an example of "Secularization of Christmas#2004-2005 Fox News campaign The War on Christmas", presenting it as having aired recently. The satirical clip featured Bee mentioning how Christmas was the only religious holiday thats also a Federal holidays in the United States federal holiday in the United States, with OReilly talking about "Secularity Secular Central...excuse me, Comedy Central".
Jon Stewart responded on his show; inviting Bee out for a discussion, and unlike in the clip that aired on Factor, Bee was visibly eight months pregnant. Bee joked it was obvious that the footage OReilly showed was a year old (it originally aired in 2004) because she had different highlights in her hair, before stating that her water had just broken.

{{main Full Frontal with Samantha Bee}}
In March 2015, it was announced that she would leave The Daily Show – after 12 years – to host her own satirical news show on Turner Broadcasting System TBS.
Bee departed The Daily Show on April 30, 2015.
Her new show, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, debuted on February 8, 2016.
With the programs debut, Bee became the first woman to host a late-night satire show.
Bee also tried to implement a hiring process which would give her show a more diverse staff than what is typical for a late night comedy show.
The first season of Full Frontal generated critical acclaim
and in November 2016, the show was renewed for a second season throughout 2017.
Bee is an executive producer of the TBS comedy series The Detour (TV series) The Detour (2016–present), which she created with her husband, Jason Jones (actor) Jason Jones.
One year into Bees run on Full Frontal, Time (magazine) Time named Bee one of the Time 100 100 most influential people in the world.
On April 29, 2017, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee hosted "Not the White House Correspondents Dinner" which aired on TBS the same evening.
In July 2017, Bees "Nasty woman Nasty Woman Shirt" campaign raised over $1 million for Planned Parenthood.
In January 2018, TBS renewed Full Frontal for a third and fourth season, set to air through 2020. Bees deal with Turner Broadcasting System Turner runs through 2022.
===="Feckless cunt" controversy====
In an episode of Full Frontal aired on May 30, 2018, Bee commented on a tweet that Ivanka Trump had posted of herself and her child: "You know, Ivanka, thats a beautiful photo of you and your child, but let me just say, one mother to another: Do something about your dads immigration practices, you feckless cunt! He listens to you! Put on something tight and low-cut and tell your father to fuckin stop it."
The day after the segment aired, Bee apologized: "I would like to sincerely apologize to Ivanka Trump and to my viewers for using an expletive on my show to describe her last night. It was inappropriate and inexcusable. I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it."
In response to her comment, Donald Trump President Trump posted on Twitter: "Why arent they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show? A total double standard but thats O.K., we are Winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!"
Kathy Griffin, Michelle Wolf, Sarah Silverman, and Jon Stewart defended Bee, with Stewart suggesting much of the outrage over the joke was strategic rather than genuine.
The show featured fewer national advertisements the following week.
Bee began the episode with an apology to any women she had offended and lamenting that one bad word had overshadowed the policy of detaining migrant children which she had been criticizing.
Two weeks after Bees original comment, Stephen Colbert ended a The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Late Show segment on border separations with "If we let this happen in our name, we are a feckless (pause) country."
==Influences==
