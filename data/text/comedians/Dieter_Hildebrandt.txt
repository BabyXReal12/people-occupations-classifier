Dieter Hildebrandt (23 May 1927 – 20 November 2013) was a German Kabarett artist.

==Biography==
Hildebrandt was born in Bolesławiec Bunzlau, Province of Lower Silesia Lower Silesia, Weimar Germany (now Boleslawiec, Poland) where he attended school. In World War II he became a Flakhelfer of the Luftwaffe but after four months was conscripted to the German Wehrmacht, in the same role.

In June 2007, a year after the Günter Grass Waffen-SS revelations, documents were released which showed that some prominent German intellectuals like Siegfried Lenz, Martin Walser and Dieter Hildebrandt had been members of the Nazi Party. For all three the documents showed their membership at a young age, during a late stage of the fascist regime in Germany – Hildebrandts application was dated 19 February 1944 (when Hildebrandt was still 16) and he was admitted on 20 April 1944, Adolf Hitler Hitlers 55th birthday.<ref name="WeltNSDAP">Die Welt: [https://www.welt.de/politik/article987203/Dieter_Hildebrandt_soll_in_NSDAP_gewesen_sein.html Dieter Hildebrandt soll in NSDAP gewesen sein] 30.

On 8 May 1945, Hildebrandt was taken captive by the United States Army, but was released a few months later.

In the years after the war, Hildebrandt finished his schooling and moved to Windischeschenbach in Bavaria. In 1948 he started studying theatre sciences in Munich. During that time he founded a student-performed cabaret show,"Die Namenlosen", in Schwabing. After finishing his studies Hildebrandt worked with Sammy Drechsel to found and develop the "Münchner Lach und Schießgesellschaft", a successful cabaret venue where he worked alongside cabaret artists such as Klaus Havenstein and Bruno Jonas. He stopped working with Drechsel in 1972, to work for radio and TV stations.

From 1973 until 1979 Hildebrandt was the presenter and author of the cabaret show "Notizen aus der Provinz" (Notes From The Province), which was broadcast by ZDF.<ref name=spiegel-zdf>{{cite news title=TV-SATIRE: Geschärftes Ohr url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-39686066.html accessdate=20 November 2013 newspaper=Der Spiegel date=19 November 1979 language=German}}</ref> In 1980 his show "Scheibenwischer" (Windscreen Wiper) first aired on the Sender Freies Berlin SFB,<ref name=kulport.hessen /> and remained on the air until 2003.<ref name=kulport.hessen /> In 1974 Hildebrandt, together with Werner Schneyder, started the "Autorenkabarett".<ref name=kulport.hessen /> This project lasted until 1982.<ref name=kulport.hessen>{{cite web last=Klaffenböck first=Rudolf title=Hildebrandt erhält Kasseler Literaturpreis url=http://www.kulturportal-hessen.de/de/sparten/literatur/aktuelle-nachrichten/3288-hildebrandt-erhaelt-kasseler-literaturpreis publisher=Kulturportal Hessen accessdate=20 November 2013 language=German}}</ref>
