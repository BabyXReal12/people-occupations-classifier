==Early life==
Anthony Jeselnik was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on December 22, 1978, the son of Stephanie and Anthony F. Jeselnik, whose surname and ancestry originates from Slovenia.<ref>[http://boards.ancestry.com/localities.eeurope.slovenia.general/2630.1/mb.ashx Family names in Slovenia], ancestry.com</ref><ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.post-gazette.com/hp_mobile/2013/02/18/TV-preview-Anthony-Jeselnik-loves-being-the-jerk-on-new-comedy-show/stories/2013021803200000000   work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette   first=Rob   last=Owen   title=TV preview: Anthony Jeselnik loves being the jerk on new comedy show   date=February 18, 2013}}</ref> He was raised in Upper St. Clair Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Upper St. Clair.<ref name="collier">{{Cite news  first=Sean  last=Collier  date=July 2011  title=King of Zing  magazine=Pittsburgh Magazine  url=http://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/Pittsburgh-Magazine/July-2011/Anthony-Jeselnik-Rules-the-Roast/  accessdate=February 17, 2013}}</ref> Jeselnik was interested in making others laugh from an early age. In elementary school, he would often interrupt the class to tell a joke. On one occasion, a classmate was moving to a different town that was not generally regarded well, and Jeselnik cracked a sarcastic comment: "Oh, well, send us a postcard."<ref name="avclub"/> When the teacher laughed at his joke, he realized that "if youre smart enough that adults get it, you can get away with anything."<ref name="avclub"/> He would often stay up attempting to watch Saturday Night Live and, as he grew older, The Ben Stiller Show and Mr. Show.<ref name="avclub"/> He graduated from Upper St. Clair High School in 1997. Jeselnik earned a bachelors degree in English literature with a business minor from Tulane University in 2001. During his senior year at Tulane, his girlfriend accidentally burned down his apartment, which he would later use as early standup material.<ref name="avclub"/> He was a member of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity while at Tulane University.  His original dream was to write the great American novel, but an internship in Los Angeles between his junior and senior years of college convinced him there were other avenues for a writer.<ref name="postgazette">{{Cite news  first=Rob  last=Owen date=February 18, 2013 title=

In his early twenties, Jeselnik moved to Los Angeles and was working at a Borders Group Borders when he first tried standup. He found a book by writer and comedian Greg Dean that promoted Deans Santa Monica comedy workshops.<ref>{{cite book  last=Collins  first=Ashley Wren  date=2011  title=The Cheap Bastards Guide to Los Angeles  url=https://books.google.com/?id=u80fTVo-9RwC&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=%22greg+dean%22+%22santa+monica%22+%22comedy%22+%22workshop%22#v=onepage&q=%22greg%20dean%22%20%22santa%20monica%22%20%22comedy%22%20%22workshop%22&f=false  location=Guilford, CT  publisher=Globe Pequot Press  page=40  isbn=978-0-7627-6003-9}}</ref><ref name="grantland"/> In his first attempt at a joke, Jeselnik did an impression of his father being stung by wasps. By the end of the skit&mdash;which lasted only one minute, but Jeselnik claimed "felt like 10"&mdash;no one had laughed, leading Jeselnik to swear off physical comedy forever.<ref name="avclub"/> After being fired by Borders, he worked as an accounting clerk for Deadwood (TV series) Deadwood, during which time he would perform at open-mic nights.<ref name="avclub"/> Inspired in part by Mitch Hedberg, Dennis Miller, Sarah Silverman,<ref>{{cite av media url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH8gV8wZgks title=Anthony Jeselnik does TMI date=February 16, 2012 publisher= via=YouTube}}</ref> and Steven Wright, it was two years into his standup comedy career when Jeselnik had a "lightbulb moment."<ref name="grantland"/> After writing a bizarre joke with a dark twist to it, the audience response encouraged Jeselnik to focus more in that area. The joke, titled "My Girlfriend Loves to Eat Chocolate," was later featured on Shakespeare.<ref name="avclub">{{cite web  title=Anthony Jeselnik on roasting, ripping off Jack Handey, and giving the devil his own TV show author=Nathan Rabin publisher=The A.V.

The Cellar comedians, known for busting the chops of other comedians, were influential to Jeselnik, and he said that the best at it were Jim Norton (comedian) Jim Norton, Colin Quinn, Bobby Kelly, and Keith Robinson (comedian) Keith Robinson.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.chicagonow.com/class-act-comedy/2013/01/comedy-centrals-anthony-jeselnik-exclusive-interview/ title=Anthony Jeselnik: Q&A on roasts, Jeff Ross and dating Amy Schumer publisher=}}</ref>

==Career==
Jeselniks Comedy Central Presents standup special premiered in 2009, and he was named one of Comedy Centrals breakout comedians of the year alongside Nick Kroll, Aziz Ansari, Whitney Cummings, Donald Glover, Matt Braunger, T. J. Miller, Kumail Nanjiani, and Jon Lajoie.<ref>{{cite web title=The Hot List url=http://ccinsider.comedycentral.com/2009/12/07/the-hot-list-the-9-best-breakout-comedians-of-2009 work=Comedy Central accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref> In 2009, Jeselnik was hired as a writer for Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. His dream job, predating standup or his first comedy class, was to sit around a table and "throw out jokes with people you respected."<ref name="grantland"/> After getting the job, Jeselniks pitches would be continually shot down as they were too dark. For example, he routinely fought for a single joke regarding obesity each day for a month, and although Fallon liked the joke, he felt uncomfortable performing it as it would likely jeopardize his likability with the obese.<ref name="grantland"/> During this period, he was a regular at the Comedy Cellar in Greenwich Village, New York City.<ref name="maron">Maron, Marc (September 1, 2011). Episode 206: Anthony Jeselnik. WTF with Marc Maron</ref> Jeselnik would work hard each day for the show and then proceed to go to Comedy Cellar, have a "big stiff drink," and do his act, feeling "miserable." In March 2010, he approached the shows producers and told them he wanted to leave. "We understand—you want to go be Anthony Jeselnik," they said.<ref name="grantland"/>

He recorded his debut album, Shakespeare (album) Shakespeare, and in 2010 began writing for the Comedy Central Roasts. Jeselnik, who refers to roasts as "the Super Bowl of comedy," loved roasts during college and always tried to write for them.<ref name="avclub"/> While Jeselnik was writing for the David Hasselhoff roast, Comedy Central executives took an interest in him and offered him an opportunity to perform on the next roast. Knowing that this would be his "big moment," Jeselnik refers to the Roast of Donald Trump as "one of my favorite moments of my life […] because no one knew who I was and it just really caught everybody by surprise. And the next day, my life was completely different."<ref name="avclub"/> While Jeselnik had previously been headlining clubs, the audience often was unfamiliar with his brand of comedy; after the Trump roast, the crowds got bigger and Jeselnik felt more comfortable.<ref name="avclub"/> Immediately following his performance, the network offered Jeselnik a "three-point deal" in which one receives an hour special, three Comedy Central roasts, and a development deal.<ref name="grantland"/> Jeselnik went on to perform at two more roasts, the Comedy Central Roasts of Charlie Sheen in 2011 and Roseanne Barr in 2012.<ref name="grantland"/><ref name="HuffPo">{{cite news title=The Comedy Central Roast of Charlie Sheen (UPDATES) url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/10/comedy-central-roast-of-charlie-sheen_n_956885.html#17_jon-lovitz-up-first publisher=Huffington Post accessdate=September 26, 2011 date=September 9, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news last=Donnelly  first=Matt  url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-roseanne-roast-jeff-ross-aurora-jokes,0,7374734.story  title=Roseanne Barr roast was even ruder than youll see on TV  publisher=latimes.com  date=August 6, 2012  accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, Jeselnik hosted his own Comedy Central series, The Jeselnik Offensive. In preparing the show, Comedy Central was looking for a half-hour, four-nights-a-week show following The Colbert Report titled Midnight.<ref name="grantland"/> Jeselniks main draw was the monologue, where he felt he could tell jokes that he was unable to do on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. For the pilot, Jeselnik did a test interview with a celebrity but felt "so wrong […] it just fit me like a bad suit."<ref name="avclub"/> For the shows first episode, Jeselnik performs cancer-related standup for a cancer support group. "I had to fight with Comedy Central to put that on the first episode," said Jeselnik. The network felt uneasy using the sketch as an introduction.<ref name="avclub"/> Jeselnik pointed to the premiere episode of Chappelles Show, in which Dave Chappelle plays a blind African-American Ku Klux Klan Klansman, which he regarded as "one of the edgiest things they ever did." As such, the sketch opened the first episode and received a positive reception; Jay Leno called to inform Jeselnik "how much he loved the cancer segment."<ref name="avclub"/> The Jeselnik Offensive ran for two seasons on Comedy Central from February 19, 2013 to August 27, 2013.

Jeselniks first standup special, Caligula, premiered in 2013.<ref>{{cite web title=Comedy Central Profile url=http://www.comedycentral.com/comedians/anthony-jeselnik accessdate=January 14, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web last=Berkowitz first=Daniel title=Anthony Jeselnik Caligula special review url=http://www.thespittake.com/2013/01/08/anthony-jeselnik-caligula-comedy-central/ publisher=The Spit Take accessdate=April 9, 2013}}</ref>
