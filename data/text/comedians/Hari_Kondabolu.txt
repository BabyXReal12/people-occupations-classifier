He characterizes his immediately post-September 11 attacks 9/11 work as self-important political argument at the expense of humor; he credits his time in the Seattle stand-up scene with teaching him that "you need the joke. I learned to value the joke again."<ref>{{Cite web url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/03/catching-up-with-hari-kondabolu.html title=Catching Up With Hari Kondabolu last=Ham first=Robert date=2014-03-10 website=Paste Magazine publisher= access-date=2016-08-07}}</ref>
