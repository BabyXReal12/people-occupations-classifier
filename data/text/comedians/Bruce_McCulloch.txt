=== The Kids in the Hall ===
As a member of The Kids in the Hall comedy troupe, McCulloch frequently wrote surreal monologues, films and songs. He also directed several of the filmed sketches. Memorable characters included the Flying Pig, Cabbage Head, talkative schoolchild Gavin, pop starlet Tammy, secretary Kathie, and grumpy middle-aged man Gordon.

McCulloch appeared in The Kids in the Hall movie Brain Candy, released in 1996. McCulloch drew controversy with his Cancer Boy character, introduced on the series final episode, in which he plays a dying young cancer patient using wheelchair who relates otherwise depressing news, in monotone,  with a cheerful smile, and even releases a hit single entitled "Whistle When Youre Low." Paramount Pictures fought to edit out the offending scenes{{citation needed date=November 2015}}, yet they were still kept in. Among other characters, McCulloch also appeared as Grivo, a depressed rock star.

He co-wrote, starred in, and was executive producer of the Kids in the Hall 2010 reunion project Death Comes to Town.<ref>[http://www.xtra.ca/public/National/Nothing_is_sacred_in_new_Kids_in_the_Hall_series-8055.aspx "Nothing is sacred in new Kids in the Hall series"].
