About her book, Hart said:

<blockquote>Each chapter will have its own recipe, so in an ideal world, when you are reading about that time I fell in love with the half-snake, half-man guy and ran off with him to work in the carnival for a summer, you will make the cotton candy martini to drink while you read. Side note: That isnt actually one of my stories. The half-snake, half-man guy was way too good for me.<ref name="Daily Dot"/></blockquote>

As to the style, she stated:

<blockquote>My whole brand of humor is self-deprecation — about owning your flaws and saying Fuck you to anyone who doesnt like it," she says. "Hopefully that feeling will come across in [this book].
