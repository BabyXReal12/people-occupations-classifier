Shawn Mathis Wayans (born January 19, 1971) is an United States American actor, Disc jockey DJ, Film producer producer, Screenwriter writer and comedian who starred in In Living Color, The Wayans Bros., and White Chicks. He is the brother of Marlon Wayans Marlon, Keenen Ivory Wayans Keenen Ivory, Damon Wayans Damon Sr., Kim Wayans Kim, Elvira, Ebony R. Hemphill-Wayans, and Ryan A. Wayans.

==Early life==
Wayans, the ninth of ten siblings, was born in New York City, New York (state) New York, the son of Elvira Alethia (Green), a homemaker and social worker, and Howell Stouten Wayans, a supermarket manager.
His family were once Jehovahs Witnesses.
Wayans grew up in the Fulton Houses in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea, Manhattan Chelsea and is a 1989 graduate of the Bayard Rustin High School for the Humanities.

On Fox Broadcasting Company Foxs In Living Color, he began as DJ SW-1 and later became a featured performer, working with brothers Dwayne, Keenen (the shows creator), Damon, Marlon and sister Kim. Along with Marlon, Shawn Wayans created and starred in the sitcom The Wayans Bros. (The WB Television Network The WB, 1995–99) and co-wrote, co-executive produced and starred in the feature Dont Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996), in which Keenen also acted. Wayans guest-starred on episodes of MacGyver (1985 TV series) MacGyver and Hangin with Mr. Cooper and provided the voice of Toof for the animated childrens series Waynehead (based on brother Damons real-life childhood experiences).

After a supporting stint in the gang drama New Blood (1999) Wayans film fortunes increased dramatically when he co-starred with his brother Marlon in a hit film directed by their older brother Keenan: Scary Movie (1999–2000), a comic satire (which he also co-wrote) on the then-recent trend of horror films like Scream (1996 film) Scream. Wayans played the apparently closeted Ray Wilkins, a role he reprised for the similarly popular 2001 sequel Scary Movie 2. To date, Wayans has not had any involvement with subsequent sequels. He kept the familial team intact when he and Marlon starred in the Keenan-directed comedy White Chicks (2004), playing a pair of FBI agents forced to masquerade as a pair of spoiled white blonde heiresses. Shawn also received a share of story and screenplay credit on the film. Wayans teamed up with Marlon and Keenen once again for the 2006 comedy Little Man (2006 film) Little Man, which Wayans acted in, co-wrote, and co-produced.
