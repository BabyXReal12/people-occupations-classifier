==Career==
In the late 1960s, Novello worked as an advertising copywriter for Leo Burnett in Chicago.<ref>{{cite book url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySMXLky50NkC&pg=PT184&lpg=PT184&dq=%22Don+Novello%22+%22Leo+Burnett%22#PPT185,M1  title=Live from New York: an uncensored ... - Google Books  publisher= date=  accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1997/09/02/DD67491.DTL&hw=comedian&sn=095&sc=330  title=Don Novello Tries To Save His Sheep / One-shot musical detailed in TV special  publisher=Sfgate.com  date=September 2, 1997  accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref>

Novello created the Father Guido Sarducci character in 1973 after finding a monsignors outfit for $7.50 at a St. Vincent de Paul thrift shop. Adding sunglasses, a broom mustache, cigarette and a thick Italian accent, Sarducci became popular in a San Francisco nightclub. Sarducci appeared on San Francisco Channel 20s Chicken Little Comedy Show, and comic David Steinberg was watching. Steinberg hired Novello as a writer for a TV show that never aired, but he also introduced Novello to Tommy and Dick Smothers, and they hired Novello, too. Novello performed on The Smothers Brothers Show in 1975, appearing as Sarducci.

{{anchor <!-- This anchor is linked from the Hatnote of the Dab page Tóth --> Lazlo}}In the 1970s, Novello started to write letters to famous people under the pen name of Lazlo Toth (after Laszlo Toth, a deranged man who vandalized Michelangelos Pietà (Michelangelo) Pietà in Rome). The letters, written to suggest a serious but misinformed and obtuse correspondent, were designed to satire tweak the noses of politicians and corporations. Many of them received serious responses; Novello sometimes continued the charade correspondence at length, with humorous results. The letters and responses were published in the books The Lazlo Letters,<ref>{{ISBN 1-56305-285-7}}</ref> Citizen Lazlo!,<ref>{{ISBN 1-56305-182-6}}</ref> and From Bush to Bush: The Lazlo Toth Letters.<ref>{{ISBN 0-7432-5108-3}}</ref>

The Lazlo Letters, Novellos first book of stilted letters to celebrities, caught the attention of Lorne Michaels, producer of Saturday Night Live. Novello was hired as a writer for the shows Saturday Night Live (season 3) third season in 1977-1978 where he remained through the Saturday Night Live (season 5) fifth season, and returned as a writer in the Saturday Night Live (season 11) eleventh season. He also appeared numerous times on the show in the Father Guido Sarducci character.

In 1980, under the name of Father Guido Sarducci, he sang lead vocals on the Warner Bros. Records release, "I Wont Be Twisting This Christmas"/"Parco MacArthur" (WBS49627). Novello co-wrote the first tune with M. Davich, and the second tune is an Italian language cover of "MacArthur Park (song) MacArthur Park", the Jimmy Webb song, in an arrangement similar to that recorded by Richard Harris.

Novello made newspapers around the world when he visited the Vatican City Vatican in 1981 wearing the Father Guido Sarducci costume and, while taking photographs for a magazine article in an area where photography was prohibited, was arrested by the Swiss Guards along with his photographer (Paul Solomon), and eventually charged with "impersonating a priest". The charges were later dropped, and Solomon managed to protect the film from confiscation.

In his stage show in Las Vegas and Reno with the Smothers Brothers, Father Guido Sarducci rolled a wheelchair with a dummy in the robes of a cardinal. In the act, Sarducci explained he was the assistant of 108-year-old "Cardinal Dario Fungi."

For a brief period in 1982, Novello was a producer on Second City Television SCTV, a Toronto-based comedy show starring Martin Short, Joe Flaherty, John Candy, Eugene Levy, Dave Thomas (actor) Dave Thomas, Rick Moranis, Andrea Martin and Catherine OHara. He was installed by NBC as one of a series of producers for the shows fourth season, and produced a total of 9 episodes. In 1984 Novello wrote The Blade, a high school yearbook parody in which the students are represented by sheep. Novello co-wrote the unfilmed script for [http://subcin.com/noblerot.html Noble Rot], with John Belushi. He also narrated Faerie Tale Theatres third-season episode Pinocchio with Paul Reubens as the titular puppet. Also in 1984, Novello appeared in the music video for the Jefferson Starship song "No Way Out".

In 1989, Novello co-starred in the anthology film New York Stories in the Francis Ford Coppola-directed segment, Life Without Zoe. In his 2 1/2 star review of the movie, Roger Ebert cited Novello for giving "the most engaging performance in the movie."

In 1990, Novello portrayed "Dominic Abbandando" in the film The Godfather Part III. Abbandando appears with speaking lines in the first scene as public relations and media coordinator for Don Michael Corleone. Most notable is when he slaps down a news reporter with the challenge: "You think you know better than the Pope?" Novello appears in many other scenes as well, shadowing George Hamilton, and in the climactic scene on the steps of the Palermo opera house, Teatro Massimo.

In 2001, he lent his voice to the character Atlantis: The Lost Empire#Voice cast Vincenzo "Vinny" Santorini in the Disney animated film Atlantis: The Lost Empire, and subsequently in the direct-to-video sequel Atlantis: Milos Return. In 2003, he filed papers to enter the 2003 California recall election, but failed to collect enough valid signatures to qualify for the ballot.

In 2005, after the death of Pope John Paul II, Novello, as Father Guido Sarducci, reprised his former SNL role as "Special Vatican Reporter" for Air America Radio host (and fellow Saturday Night Live alumnus) Al Franken. He continued this role until the election of Pope Benedict XVI. In 2006, he portrayed the role of Galileo on the podcast "The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd".

He portrayed Pope Pius XII in the 2009 short film All in the Bunker.

On June 23, 2010, he appeared on The Colbert Report as Father Guido Sarducci.

On October 30, 2010, he gave the benediction at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear hosted by Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert.<ref>{{YouTube IGCP5CqHwxk}}</ref>

American recording artist Guthrie Thomas credited Don Novello as "the best performer in the room" when Novello appeared as Father Guido Sarducci on one of Thomas albums in a recording studio full of famous performers.
