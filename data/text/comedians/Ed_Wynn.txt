Isaiah Edwin Leopold (November 9, 1886 – June 19, 1966), better known as Ed Wynn, was an American actor and comedian noted for his Perfect Fool comedy character, his pioneering radio show of the 1930s, and his later career as a dramatic actor.<ref name="WVobit">Obituary Variety Obituaries Variety, June 22, 1966, page 71.</ref>

==Background==
Wynn was born Isaiah Edwin Leopold in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father, who manufactured and sold womens hats, was born in Kingdom of Bohemia Bohemia. His mother, of Romanian and Turkish people Turkish ancestry, came from Istanbul.<ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aZpjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=N3wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4126,1046400  title=Famed comedian Ed Wynn once owned theater in New Port Richey date=January 2, 1979  accessdate=September 19, 2008 publisher=St. Petersburg Times author=Wilfred T.

==Early career==
Wynn began his career in vaudeville in 1903<ref>"New York Hoorays for Ed Wynn" [https://books.google.com/books?id=pD8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA44&dq=ed%20wynn&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q&f=false], LIFE, December 20, 1937, p. 46, accessed May 31, 2011.</ref><ref>"August Clown" [https://books.google.com/books?id=4EcEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA74&ots=ZKVNV46qUQ&dq=wynn%20%26%20lewis&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q&f=false], LIFE, July 26, 1948, p. 74, accessed May 31, 2011.</ref> and was a star of the Ziegfeld Follies starting in 1914. During The Follies of 1915, W. C. Fields allegedly caught Wynn Overacting mugging for the audience under the table during Fields Pool Room routine and knocked Wynn unconscious with his cue.<ref>"August Clown" [https://books.google.com/books?id=4EcEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA74&ots=ZKVNV46qUQ&dq=wynn%20%26%20lewis&pg=PA70#v=onepage&q&f=false], LIFE, July 26, 1948, p. 70, accessed May 31, 2011.</ref> Wynn wrote, directed, and produced many Broadway theatre Broadway shows in the subsequent decades, and was known for his silly costumes and props as well as for the giggly, wavering voice he developed for the 1921 musical review, The Perfect Fool.

==Radio==

Although many gag writers later provided material for Wynns performances in radio, television and movies, he was proud to boast that he had written every line he ever spoke during his early career as a stage performer.{{Citation needed date=May 2011}}

In the early 1930s Wynn hosted the popular radio show Texaco Star Theater The Fire Chief, heard in North America on Tuesday nights, sponsored by Texaco gasoline. Like many former vaudeville performers who turned to radio in the same decade, the stage-trained Wynn insisted on playing for a live studio audience, doing each program as an actual stage show, using visual bits to augment his written material, and in his case, wearing a colorful costume with a red firemans helmet. He usually bounced his gags off announcer/straight man Graham McNamee; Wynns customary opening, "Tonight, Graham, the shows gonna be different," became one of the most familiar tag-lines of its time; a sample joke: "Graham, my uncle just bought a new second-handed car... he calls it Baby! I dont know, it wont go anyplace without a rattle!"

Wynn reprised his Fire Chief radio character in two movies, Follow the Leader (1930) and The Chief (1933). Near the height of his radio fame (1933) he founded his own short-lived radio network the Amalgamated Broadcasting System, which lasted only five weeks, nearly destroying the comedian. According to radio historian Elizabeth McLeod, the failed venture left Wynn deep in debt, divorced and finally, suffering a nervous breakdown.<ref>{{Cite web url = http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Articles/Elizabeth%20McLeod/wynn.htm title =  Tonight The Programs Gonna Be Different!The Life and Times of Ed Wynn, The Fire Chief date =  accessdate=June 2, 2015 website = Old Time Radio Researchers Group publisher =  last =McLeod  first =Elizabeth }}</ref>

Wynn was offered the title role in MGMs 1939 screen adaptation of The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) The Wizard of Oz, but turned it down, as did his Ziegfeld contemporary W. C. Fields. The part went to Frank Morgan.

==Television==
Ed Wynn first appeared on television on July 7, 1936 in a brief, ad-libbed spot with Graham McNamee during an NBC experimental television broadcast.  In the 1949–50 season, Ed Wynn hosted one of the first network, comedy-variety television shows, on CBS, and won both a Peabody Award and an Emmy Award in 1949. Buster Keaton, Lucille Ball, and The Three Stooges all made guest appearances with Wynn.  This was the first CBS variety television show to originate from Los Angeles, which was seen live on the west coast, but filmed via kinescope for distribution in the Midwest and East, as the national coaxial cable had yet to be completed.<ref>{{Cite web url = https://archive.org/details/TheEdWynnShow1950 title = The Ed Wynn Show, 1950 date =  accessdate=December 8, 2014 website = Internet Archive – Moving Image Archive publisher =  last =  first = }}</ref> Wynn was also a rotating host of NBCs Four Star Revue from 1950 through 1952.

After the end of Wynns third television series, The Ed Wynn Show (a short-lived situation comedy on NBCs 1958–59 schedule), his son, actor Keenan Wynn, encouraged him to make a career change rather than retire. The comedian reluctantly began a career as a dramatic actor in television and movies. Father and son appeared in three productions, the first of which was the 1956 Playhouse 90 broadcast of Rod Serlings play Requiem for a Heavyweight. Ed was terrified of straight acting and kept goofing his lines in rehearsal. When the producers wanted to fire him, star Jack Palance said he would quit if they fired Ed. (However, unbeknownst to Wynn, supporting player Ned Glass was his secret understudy in case something did happen before air time.) On live broadcast night, Wynn surprised everyone with his pitch-perfect performance, and his quick ad libs to cover his mistakes. A dramatization of what happened during the production was later staged as an April 1960 Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse episode, "The Man in the Funny Suit", starring both senior and junior Wynns, with key figures involved in the original production also portraying themselves. Ed and his son also worked together in the Jose Ferrer film The Great Man, with Ed again proving his unexpected skills in drama.

Requiem established Wynn as a serious dramatic actor who could easily hold his own with the best. His role in The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film) The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) won him an Academy Awards Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

Also in 1959, Wynn appeared on Serlings TV series The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series) The Twilight Zone in  "One for the Angels". Serling, a longtime admirer, had written that episode especially for him, and Wynn later in 1963 starred in the episode "Ninety Years Without Slumbering". For the rest of his life, Wynn skillfully moved between comic and dramatic roles. He appeared in feature films and anthology television, endearing himself to new generations of fans.

==Cartoons==
Wynn was caricatured in the Merrie Melodies cartoon shorts Shuffle Off to Buffalo (1933) and Ive Got to Sing a Torch Song (1933), and as a pot of jam in the Betty Boop short Betty in Blunderland (1934).

==Films==
He appeared as the Fairy Godfather in Jerry Lewis Cinderfella. His performance as Paul Beaseley in the 1958 film The Great Man earned him nominations for a Golden Globe Award for "Best Supporting Actor" and a BAFTA Award for "Best Foreign Actor". The following year he received his first (and only) nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Mr. Dussell in The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film) The Diary of Anne Frank (1959). Six years later he appeared in the Bible epic The Greatest Story Ever Told.

==Disney==
Wynn provided the voice of the Mad Hatter in Walt Disneys film, Alice in Wonderland (1951 film) Alice in Wonderland and played The Toymaker alongside Annette Funicello and Tommy Sands (entertainer) Tommy Sands in Babes in Toyland (1961 film) Walt Disneys Babes in Toyland released in 1961.

Possibly his best-remembered film appearance was in Walt Disneys Mary Poppins (film) Mary Poppins (1964), in which he played eccentric man Uncle Albert floating around just beneath the ceiling in uncontrollable mirth, singing "I Love to Laugh".

Re-teaming with the Disney team the following year, in That Darn Cat! (1965 film) That Darn Cat! (1965) featuring Dean Jones (actor) Dean Jones and Hayley Mills, Wynn filled out the character of Mr. Hofstedder, the watch jeweler with his bumbling charm. He also had brief roles in The Absent Minded Professor (as the Ed_Wynn#Radio fire chief, in a scene alongside his son Keenan Wynn, who played the films antagonist) and Son of Flubber (as county agricultural agent A.J. Allen). His final performance, as Rufus in Walt Disneys The Gnome-Mobile, was released a few months after his death.

In addition to Disney films, Wynn was also an actor in the Disneyland production The Golden Horseshoe Revue.
