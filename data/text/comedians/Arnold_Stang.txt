==Career==
Stang once claimed he got his break in radio by sending a postcard to a New York station requesting an audition, was accepted, and then bought his own ticket to New York from Chelsea, Massachusetts, with the money set aside for his mothers anniversary gift.
True or not, Stang worked on New York-based network radio shows as a boy, appearing on childrens programs such as The Horn and Hardart Childrens Hour and Lets Pretend.
By 1940, he had graduated to teenaged roles, appearing as Seymour
on The Goldbergs (broadcast series) The Goldbergs. Director Don Bernard hired him in October 1941 to do the commercials on the Columbia Broadcasting Company CBS program Meet Mr. Meek but decided his constantly cracking voice would hurt the commercial so he ordered scriptwriters to come up with a role for him.
He next appeared on the summer replacement show The Remarkable Miss Tuttle with Edna May Oliver in 1942
and replaced Eddie Firestone Jr. in the title role of That Brewster Boy when Firestone joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1943.
Comedian Henry Morgan (comedian) Henry Morgan made him a sidekick on his program in fall of 1946 and Stang appeared in similar roles the following year on radio shows with Eddie Cantor
and Milton Berle.
He also did the voice of Jughead Jones Jughead for a short while on Archie Andrews#Archie on radio The Archie radio show.

At this time Stang had appeared in a number of movies, including Seven Days Leave, My Sister Eileen, So This Is New York (film) So This Is New York with Henry Morgan, and They Got Me Covered. He had also appeared on the Broadway theatre Broadway stage in Sailor Beware! (play) Sailor Beware, All In Favor and Same Time Next Week, where he first worked with Berle.
Stang moved to television at the start of the Golden Age. He had a recurring role in the TV show The School House on the DuMont Television Network in 1949. He was a regular on Eddie Mayehoffs short-lived situation comedy Doc Corkle in fall of 1952
as well as comedy relief on Captain Video and His Video Rangers as Clumsy McGee. Then he made a guest appearance on Milton Berles Texaco Star Theater on May 12, 1953
and joined him as a regular as Francis the Stagehand the following September, often berating or heckling the big-egoed star for big laughs. Stang also had guest roles on several variety shows of the day including The Colgate Comedy Hour.

On television he appeared in Television advertisement commercials for the Nestlé Chunky Chunky candy bar, where he would list many of its ingredients, smile and say, "Chunky, what a chunk of chocolate!" He provided the voice of the Honey Nut Cheerios Bee in the 1980s and was also a spokesman for Vicks Vicks Vapo-Rub. As a pitchman for Alcoa aluminum window screens in the late 1960s, he was known for the tag line "Arnold Stang says dont get stung".  Stang also appeared in "The Grave Robber," an episode of the popular horror anthology series Tales from the Darkside, playing Tapok, an ancient Egyptian mummy who encounters some unscrupulous archaeologists that lure him into a game of strip poker.

Stang once described himself as "a frightened chipmunk whos been out in the rain too long."
As for his distinctive squawky, nasal Brooklyn voice, he said "Im kind of attached to it...[its] a personal logo. Its like your Jell-O or Xerox.

He began performing at the age of nine in radio shows such as Lets Pretend, eventually playing in dramas and mysteries as what he once called "little killers," according to radio historian Gerald Nachman (Raised on Radio). He told Nachman that he knew his nasal voice was his meal ticket. "Im kind of attached to it," he quipped to Nachman. "My personal logo. Its like Jell-O or Xerox." He also told Nachman that the bulk of his fan mail does not even address his film or television work. "All about my radio career," he said.-->
