==Career==

In 2006, Burnham videotaped himself performing two songs and posted them on YouTube to share with his family.
They quickly became popular through YouTube, Break.com, and other sites.
Accompanying himself on guitar or digital piano, Burnham continued to release self-described "pubescent musical comedy"
songs and videos online as his audience grew.  Described in The Boston Globe as "simultaneously wholesome and disturbing, intimate in a folksy-creepy sort of way", Burnham wrote and released songs about white supremacy, Helen Kellers disabilities, homosexuality, and more.
All of Burnhams home-released videos were self-recorded in and around his familys home in Hamilton, Massachusetts, most in his bedroom,
and had an intentional "do-it-yourself [feel], almost like voyeurism".
Burnhams music and performances tackle such subjects as race (classification of human beings) race, gender, human sexuality, sex, and religion.
Burnham describes his on-stage persona as a "more arrogant, stuck-up version [of] himself".
When speaking with The Detroit News about his rapping, he expressed his intent to honor and respect the perspective and culture of hip-hop music.
Represented by Douglas Edley, Burnham recorded a performance in London for Comedy Centrals The World Stands Up in January 2008 (aired June 30, 2008),
and signed a four-record deal with Comedy Central Records.
Comedy Central Records released Burnhams first EP, the six-song Bo Fo Sho, as an digital distribution online release-only album on June 17, 2008.
Burnhams first full album, the self-titled Bo Burnham (album) Bo Burnham, was released on March 10, 2009.
Burnham has performed his music in the United States, including Cobbs Comedy Club, YouTube Live in San Francisco,
and Carolines Carolines Comedy Club in New York City,
and internationally in London and Montreal.  In August 2010, Burnham was nominated for "Best Comedy Show" at the 2010 Edinburgh Comedy Awards after his inaugural performance (of Words Words Words Bo Burnham: Words, Words, Words).
He instead received the "Panel Prize", a £5,000 prize for "the show or act who has most captured the comedy spirit of the 2010 Fringe".
Burnhams first experience with controversy regarding his music came on March 3, 2009, when fifteen Westminster College (Missouri) Westminster College students (members of the campus Gay-Straight Alliance, Black Students Association, International Club, and Cultural Diversity Organization) protested his concert there that evening.
<!-- Though Burnham is playing characters in his performances, to make it comedy, that line has to be a thin one. -->
Of the controversy, he said, "Its so ironic because gay bashing gay bashers were the ones labeling me in high school ... I try and write satire thats well-intentioned.  But those intentions have to be hidden.  It cant be completely clear and thats what makes it comedy." Despite the colleges admission that they had booked Burnham while ignorant of his shows material, dean of students John Comerford praised the opportunities for discourse the controversy brought the school.
On May 21, 2010, Burnham taped his first one-hour stand-up special, entitled Words Words Words, for Comedy Central from the House of Blues in Boston as part of the networks new "House of Comedy" series of stand-up specials; it aired on Comedy Central on October 16, 2010. It was released on October 18, 2010. Burnhams second special, titled what., was released on both Netflix and YouTube on December 17, 2013.
Burnhams latest special, Make Happy, was produced by Netflix and released on June 3, 2016.

While performing at the Montreal Just for Laughs festival in 2008,
Burnham met with director and producer Judd Apatow. That September, Burnham negotiated with Universal Pictures to write and create the music for an Apatow-produced comedy film which he describes as the "anti-High School Musical",
although Burnham insists the script is not a parody of the Disney musicals, but an attempt to emulate the high school he attended. Hoping to star in the film he was writing, Burnham told Wired (magazine) Wired magazine that he named the star "Bo" in a "not-so-subtle hint [he] want[s] to be in it".
In a March 2009 interview with Bostons Weekly Dig, Burnham elaborated on his work with the film. When he is not performing, Burnham spends eight hours a day writing the music, and his nights writing the script, of which he has finished the first draft.
Co-writing the screenplay with Burnham was his high school friend Luke Liacos.
In an October 2010 interview with MTV, Burnham admitted that he did not know anything about the future of the project, and that it was all effectively up in the air as far as he knew.
In May 2009, viral marketing began appearing for Funny People, in which Burnham stars in a NBC sitcom called Yo Teach! In the promo, Burnham stars opposite Jason Schwartzman, as a student in the latters English language English class.
Burnham wrote and directed his first feature film, Eighth Grade (film) Eighth Grade, which was produced and distributed by A24 (company) A24 and premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival Sundance Film Festival in January 2018.
The film has been received well by critics: it garnered a 98% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes,
and holds an average rating of 90 out of 100 on Metacritic.
===Television===

In 2010, Burnham wrote, executive-produced, and starred in Zach Stone Is Gonna Be Famous alongside Dan Lagana, Luke Liacos, and Dave Becky.
The series was not picked up for a second season and officially ended on June 26, 2013.
===Awards===

At the 2010 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, he was nominated for the main Edinburgh Comedy Awards Edinburgh Comedy Award and won both the Edinburgh Comedy Awards panel prize and the Malcolm Hardee "Act Most Likely to Make a Million Quid" Award.
