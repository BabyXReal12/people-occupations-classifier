Lee and Blake then hosted a comedy programme on Australias Seven Network, The Hamish and Andy Show, which was shortly cancelled after bad ratings. Critics acknowledged their talent, but panned the show as poorly executed.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/culture/hamish-amp-andy/2007/04/02/1175366136794.html?page=4 title=Hamish & Andy website=www.theage.com.au}}</ref> Since this show, Lee and Blake have almost always performed together.
