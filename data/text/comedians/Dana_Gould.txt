Gould wrote and performed on The Ben Stiller Show; one such sketch features Gould as Otto, Cupids twisted brother, whose arrows convince a young man to fall madly in love with an elderly woman. Another series of sketches features a heavily disguised Gould as Wilford Brimley advertising "Gradys Oats" (a parody of Brimleys Quaker Oats advertisements). In one, he speaks of his Uncle Rays hobby of dressing in a pink taffeta gown and filling his panties with oatmeal; in another, he brandishes a revolver through the window at children.

He left the show in late 2006 in order to focus on his own screenwriting, though he served as co-executive producer on seasons 14 through 18.

Gould had a featured cameo in Girls Will Be Girls (film) Girls Will Be Girls, in which he played a hit-and-run victim who admits to his alcohol problem after having a desperate one-night stand with aging C-list actress Evie Harris, the other driver in the car accident.
