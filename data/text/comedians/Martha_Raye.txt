Martha first appeared in their act when she was three years old. She later performed with her brother "Bud", and the children became so popular that their parents act was renamed "Margie and Bud."

==Career==
In the early 1930s, Raye was a band vocalist with the Paul Ash and Boris Morros orchestras. She made her first film appearance in 1934 in a band short titled A Nite in the Nite Club. In 1936, she was signed for comic roles by Paramount Pictures, and made her first picture for Paramount. Her first feature film was Rhythm on the Range with crooner Bing Crosby.

From 1936–39, she was a featured cast member in 39 episodes of Al Jolsons weekly CBS radio show, The Lifebuoy Program, also called Cafe Trocadero. In addition to comedy, Martha sang both solos and duets with Jolson. Over the next quarter century, she would appear with many of the leading comics of her day, including Joe E. Brown (comedian) Joe E. Brown, Bob Hope, W. C. Fields, Abbott and Costello (in Keep Em Flying), Charlie Chaplin (in Monsieur Verdoux), and Jimmy Durante. She joined the United Service Organizations USO in 1942, soon after the US entered World War II.<ref name="rayeMT">{{cite web url=https://www.uso.org/stories/1804-martha-raye-healing-through-humor title=Martha Raye: Healing Through Humor last=Quigley first=Samantha date=April 26, 2013 publisher=United Service Organizations work=USO.org accessdate=October 26, 2016}}</ref>

She was known for the size of her mouth, which was large in proportion to her face, earning her the nickname The Big Mouth. She later referred to this in a series of television commercials for Polident denture cleaner in the 1980s: "So take it from The Big Mouth: new Polident Green gets tough stains clean!" Her large mouth would relegate her motion picture work to supporting comic parts, and was often made up so it appeared even larger. In the Disney cartoon Mother Goose Goes Hollywood, she is caricatured while dancing alongside Joe E. Brown, another actor known for a big mouth. In the Warner Bros. cartoon The Woods Are Full Of Cuckoos (1937), she was caricatured as a jazzy scat-singing donkey named Moutha Bray.<ref>{{cite book last=Pittrone first=Jane Maddern page=216 title=Take It from the Big Mouth: The Life of Martha Raye publisher=University of Kentucky Press year=1999 isbn=}}</ref>

Well-wishers gave her a St. Christophers medal, a Genesius of Rome St. Genesius medal, and a Star of David. After her recovery, she wore these amulets faithfully, although she was neither Roman Catholic nor Jewish. At the conclusion of each episode of her TV shows, she would thank the nuns at the Sisters of St. Francis Hospital in Miami, Florida Miami, Florida, where she had recovered. She would always say, "Goodnight, Sisters" as a sign of appreciation and gratitude.

She often appeared as a guest on other programs, particularly ones that often had older performers as guest stars such as American Broadcasting Company ABCs The Love Boat, and on variety programs including the short-lived The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show. She appeared from the third to the ninth seasons as Carrie Sharples on Alice (TV series) Alice, making two or three appearances a season. She made guest appearances or did cameo roles in such series as Murder, She Wrote on CBS and The Andy Williams Show and McMillan & Wife, both on NBC.
