Afterward, Ramis worked in a mental institution in St. Louis for seven months. He later said of his time working there that it
{{quote text=...prepared me well for when I went out to Hollywood to work with actors. People laugh when I say that, but it was actually very good training. And not just with actors; it was good training for just living in the world. Its knowing how to deal with people who might be reacting in a way thats connected to anxiety or grief or fear or rage. As a director, youre dealing with that constantly with actors. But if I were a businessman, Id probably be applying those same principles to that line of work.<ref name=sacks />}}

==Career==

===Early years===
Ramis began writing parody parodic plays in college, saying years later, "In my heart, I felt I was a combination of Groucho Marx Groucho and Harpo Marx, of Groucho using his wit as a weapon against the upper classes, and of Harpos antic charm and the fact that he was oddly sexy—he grabs women, pulls their skirts off, and gets away with it".<ref name="newyorker" /> He avoided the Vietnam War military draft by taking methamphetamine to fail his draft physical.<ref name="GQcs">{{cite journal last=Martin  first=Brett  date=July 2009  title=Harold Ramis Gets the Last Laugh  journal=GQ  pages=64–67, 124–25  url=http://men.style.com/gq/features/full?id=content_9558&pageNum=5  accessdate=August 15, 2009  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701134936/http://men.style.com/gq/features/full?id=content_9558&pageNum=5  archivedate=July 1, 2009}}</ref>

Following his work in St. Louis, Ramis returned to Chicago, where by 1968, he was a substitute teacher at schools serving the inner-city Robert Taylor Homes.<ref>Caldwell, Sara C., and Marie-Eve S.

"Michael Shamberg, right out of college, had started freelancing for newspapers and got on as a stringer for a local paper, and I thought, Well, if Michael can do that, I can do that.

Ramis newspaper writing led to his becoming joke editor at Playboy Playboy magazine.<ref name=sacks/> "I called ... just cold and said I had written several pieces freelance and did they have any openings.

===National Lampoon, SCTV, and The Top===
After leaving Second City for a time and returning in 1972, having been replaced in the main cast by John Belushi, Ramis worked his way back as Belushis deadpan foil. In 1974, Belushi brought Ramis and other Second City performers, including Ramis frequent future collaborator Bill Murray, to New York City to work on  The National Lampoon Radio Hour.<ref name="newyorker" />

During this time, Ramis, Belushi, Murray, Joe Flaherty, Christopher Guest, and Gilda Radner starred in the revue The National Lampoon Show, the successor to National Lampoons Lemmings.<ref>{{Cite book  last=Karp  first=Josh  title=A Futile and Stupid Gesture: How Doug Kenney and National Lampoon Changed Comedy Forever  location=  publisher=Chicago Review Press  year=2006  page=219  isbn=1-55652-602-4}}</ref> Later, Ramis became a performer on, and head writer of, the late-night sketch-comedy television series Second City Television SCTV during its first three years (1976–1979).<ref>Caldwell, Kielson, p. 77</ref> He was soon offered work as a writer at Saturday Night Live but chose to continue with SCTV.<ref name="NYT obit" /> Characterizations by Ramis on SCTV include corrupt Dialing for Dollars host/SCTV station manager Maurice "Moe" Green, amiable cop Officer Friendly, exercise guru Swami Bananananda, board chairman Allan "Crazy Legs" Hirschman and home dentist Mort Finkel. His celebrity impressions on SCTV included Kenneth Clark and Leonard Nimoy.

In 1984, Ramis executive produced a music/comedy/variety television show called The Top. The Producer was Paul Flattery and the Director was David Jove. Ramis got involved after the mysterious death of his friend Peter Ivers who had hosted Joves underground show "New Wave Theater." He called Jove and offered to help. Flattery and Jove pitched him the idea for "The Top," and Ramis was instrumental in getting it on the air.

The show was a mixture of live music, videos, and humor.

Performers on the show included Cyndi Lauper, who performed "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" and "True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song) True Colors"; the Hollies, who performed "Stop in the Name of Love"; and the Romantics, who performed their two hits at the time, "Talking in Your Sleep (The Romantics song) Talking in Your Sleep" and "What I Like About You (song) What I Like About You."

Guest stars included Rodney Dangerfield, Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd. Ramis got Chevy Chase to host but, because Ghostbusters filming ran late, he did not make it to the taping.  Chase came out dressed as a "punk" of the time and somehow got into a physical altercation with an audience member (also a punk) during the opening monologue. He immediately left the taping. Flattery and Jove carried on with the show.

Ramis then got Andy Kaufman to fill in for Chase and recorded the host segments at a separate, later, session. It was to be the last professional appearance by Andy Kaufman before his death.

The Top aired on Friday, January 27, 1984, at 7&nbsp;pm. It scored a 7.7% rating and a 14% share. This represented a 28% rating increase and a 27% share increase over KTLAs regularly scheduled Happy Days/Laverne and Shirley.

===Film career===
Ramis left SCTV to pursue a film career and wrote a script with National Lampoon (magazine) National Lampoon magazines Douglas Kenney, which eventually became Animal House National Lampoons Animal House. They were later joined by a third collaborator, Chris Miller (writer) Chris Miller.  The 1978 film followed the struggle between a rowdy college fraternity house and the Dean (education) college dean. The films humor was raunchy for its time. Animal House "broke all box-office records for comedies" and earned $141&nbsp;million.<ref name="newyorker" />

Ramis next co-wrote the comedy Meatballs (film) Meatballs, starring Bill Murray. The movie was a commercial success and became the first of six film collaborations between Murray and Ramis.<ref name="newyorker" /> His third film and his directorial debut was Caddyshack, which he wrote with Kenney and Brian Doyle-Murray.  It starred Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, and Bill Murray. Like Ramiss previous two films, Caddyshack was a commercial success.

In 1982, Ramis was attached to direct the film adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole.  The film was to star John Belushi and Richard Pryor, but the project was aborted.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070610110538/http://www.premiere.com/features/3861/20-movies-not-coming-soon-to-a-theater-near-you-page4.html Saito, Stephen  "20 Movies Not Coming Soon to a Theater Near You"], Section: "A Confederacy of Dunces", Premiere (magazine) Premiere, no date</ref> In 1984, Ramis collaborated with Dan Aykroyd on the screenplay for Ghostbusters, which became one of the biggest comedy hits of all time, in which he also starred as Dr. Egon Spengler,<ref>{{cite web title=Ghostbusters 3 in Theaters by Christmas 2012! url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/20170/ publisher=Bloody Disgusting}}</ref> a role he reprised for the 1989 sequel, Ghostbusters II (which he also co-wrote with Aykroyd). His later film Groundhog Day (film) Groundhog Day has been called his "masterpiece".<ref name="newyorker">{{cite news   last=Friend   first=Tad   authorlink=Tad Friend   url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/04/19/040419fa_fact3?currentPage=all  title= Comedy First: How Harold Ramis’s movies have stayed funny for twenty-five years   work=The New Yorker   date= April 19, 2004 accessdate=August 28, 2007}}</ref>

His films have been noted for attacking "the smugness of institutional life ... with an impish good [will] that is unmistakably American". They are also noted for "Ramiss signature tongue-in-cheek pep talks". Sloppiness and improv were also important aspects of his work. Ramis frequently depicted the qualities of "anger, curiosity, laziness, and woolly idealism" in "a hyper-articulate voice".<ref name="newyorker"/>

Ramis also occasionally acted in supporting roles in acclaimed films that he did not write or direct such as James L. Brookss Academy Award-winning As Good as It Gets (1997) and Judd Apatows hit comedy Knocked Up (2007).

In 2004, Ramis turned down the opportunity to direct the Bernie Mac-Ashton Kutcher film Guess Who (film) Guess Who, then under the working title "The Dinner Party", because he considered it poorly written. That same year, he began filming the low-budget The Ice Harvest, "his first attempt to make a comic film noir". Ramis spent six weeks trying to get the film Greenlight greenlit because he had difficulty reaching an agreement about stars John Cusacks and Billy Bob Thorntons salaries. The film received mixed reviews. In 2004, Ramiss typical directing fee was $5&nbsp;million.<ref name="newyorker" />

In an interview in the documentary American Storytellers, Ramis said he hoped to make a film about Emma Goldman (even pitching Disney with the idea of having Bette Midler star)<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2004/04/14/sunday_am/10048008.txt  title=An exceedingly dangerous woman:Emma Goldmans story   first=  L.

Ramis said in 2009 he planned to make a third Ghostbusters film for release either in mid-2011<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.heebmagazine.com/blog/view/2471  title=Ramis on Ghostbusters 3: Plans to Shoot Next Summer and Release in 2011  first=Brian  last=Abrams  work=Heeb  date=December 28, 2009  accessdate=February 24, 2014  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329233859/http://www.heebmagazine.com/blog/view/2471  archivedate=March 29, 2010  df=mdy-all }}</ref> or for Christmas 2012.<ref>Ramis interview, WABC-TV, via {{cite web url= http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18543   title = Harold Ramis Says Ghostbusters 3 in 2011!   publisher=BloodyDisgustng.com   date= December 30, 2009   accessdate= 2014-02-24}}</ref> The Ghostbusters (2016 film) film was eventually made and released in 2016, although directed and co-written by Paul Feig, not Ramis.

Ramis and longtime collaborator Bill Murray had a falling out during the filming of Groundhog Day (film) Groundhog Day, which Ramis attributed to issues that Murray had with his own life at the time.
