William Claude Dukenfield (January 29, 1880<ref>"Fields always observed his birthday on January 29, and his death certificate confirms this .... When Fields married Harriet Veronica Hughes in San Francisco, on April 8, 1900, he was twenty years old and, under California law, could not enter into a marriage without parental consent. He therefore gave his birthdate as April 9, 1879, and often used this date thereafter. However, when he applied for a passport later that same year, he swore under oath that his correct birthdate was January 29, 1880." Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 525</ref> – December 25, 1946), better known as W. C. Fields, was an American comedian, actor, juggler and writer.<ref>Obituary Variety Obituaries Variety, January 1, 1947, page 46.</ref> Fields comic persona was a Misanthropy misanthropic and hard-drinking egotist, who remained a sympathetic character despite his snarling contempt for dogs and children.

His career in show business began in vaudeville, where he attained international success as a silent juggler. He gradually incorporated comedy into his act, and was a featured comedian in the Ziegfeld Follies for several years. He became a star in the Broadway musical comedy Poppy (1923 musical) Poppy (1923), in which he played a colorful small-time confidence trick con man. His subsequent stage and film roles were often similar scoundrels, or henpecked everyman characters.

Among his recognizable trademarks were his raspy drawl and Grandiloquence grandiloquent vocabulary. The characterization he portrayed in films and on radio was so strong it was generally identified with Fields himself. It was maintained by the publicity departments at Fields studios (Paramount Pictures Paramount and Universal Studios Universal) and was further established by Robert Lewis Taylors biography, W. C. Fields, His Follies and Fortunes (1949).  Beginning in 1973, with the publication of Fields letters, photos, and personal notes in grandson Ronald Fields book W. C. Fields by Himself, it was shown that Fields was married (and subsequently estranged from his wife), and financially supported their son and loved his grandchildren.

==Early years==
Fields was born William Claude Dukenfield in Darby, Pennsylvania, the oldest child of a working-class family. His father, James Lydon Dukenfield (1840–1913), was from an English family that emigrated from Sheffield, England in 1854.<ref>Simon Louvish, Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W. C.

Claude Dukenfield (as he was known) had a volatile relationship with his short-tempered father. He ran away from home repeatedly, beginning at the age of nine, often to stay with his grandmother or an uncle.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A.

Fields later embellished stories of his childhood, depicting himself as a runaway who lived by his wits on the streets of Philadelphia from an early age, but his home life seems to have been reasonably happy.<ref>Louvish, Simon.

W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 68–69.</ref>

==Entry into vaudeville==
Inspired by the success of the "Original Tramp Juggler", James Edward Harrigan,<ref>Trav, S.D. No Applause—Just Throw Money: The Book That Made Vaudeville Famous, 1965, p. 146.</ref> Fields adopted a similar costume of scruffy beard and shabby tuxedo and entered vaudeville as a genteel "Hobo tramp juggler" in 1898, using the name W. C. Fields.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 26.</ref> His family supported his ambitions for the stage and saw him off on the train for his first stage tour. To conceal a stutter, Fields did not speak onstage.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 30.</ref> In 1900, seeking to distinguish himself from the many "tramp" acts in vaudeville, he changed his costume and makeup, and began touring as "The Eccentric Juggler".<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 46–47.</ref> He cigar box (juggling) manipulated cigar boxes, hats, and other objects in what appears to have been a unique and fresh act, parts of which are reproduced in some of his films, notably in The Old Fashioned Way (film) The Old Fashioned Way (1934).

By the early 1900s, while touring, he was regularly called the worlds greatest juggler.<ref>{{cite news  title=W.C. Fields Biography  url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/w-c-fields.html  journal=The Biography Channel  location=UK  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406054319/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/w-c-fields.html  archivedate=April 6, 2013  df=mdy-all}}</ref> He became a headliner in North America and Europe, and toured Australia and South Africa in 1903.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, p. 488.</ref> When Fields played for English-speaking audiences, he found he could get more laughs by adding muttered patter and sarcastic asides to his routines. According to W. Buchanan-Taylor, a performer who saw Fields performance in an English music hall, Fields would "reprimand a particular ball which had not come to his hand accurately", and "mutter weird and unintelligible expletives to his cigar when it missed his mouth".<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, p. 54.</ref>

==Broadway==
In 1905 Fields made his Broadway debut in a musical comedy, The Ham Tree. His role in the show required him to deliver lines of dialogue, which he had never before done onstage.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p, 72.</ref>  He later said, "I wanted to become a real comedian, and there I was, ticketed and pigeonholed as merely a comedy juggler."<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 85.</ref> In 1913 he performed on a bill with Sarah Bernhardt (who regarded Fields as "an artiste [who] could not fail to please the best class of audience") first at the New York Palace, and then in England in a royal performance for the king and queen.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 87.</ref>  He continued touring in vaudeville until 1915.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, p. 495.</ref>

Beginning in 1915, he appeared on Broadway theater Broadway in Florenz Ziegfelds Ziegfeld Follies revue,<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 99–100.</ref> delighting audiences with a wild Pocket billiards billiards skit, complete with bizarrely shaped cues and a custom-built table used for a number of hilarious gags and surprising trick shots. His pool game is reproduced, in part, in some of his films, notably in Six of a Kind (1934). The act was a success, and Fields starred in the Follies from 1916 to 1922, not as a juggler but as a comedian in ensemble sketches.  In addition to multiple editions of the Follies, Fields starred in the Broadway musical comedy Poppy (1923 musical) Poppy (1923), wherein he perfected his persona as a colorful small-time confidence trick con man.

His stage costume from 1915 onwards featured a top hat, cut-away coat and collar, and a cane—an appearance remarkably similar to the comic strip character Ally Sloper, who may have been the inspiration for Fields costume, according to Roger Sabin. The Sloper character may in turn have been inspired by Dickens Mr Micawber, whom Fields later played on film.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/graphicnovel/rogersabin.htm title=Ally Sloper: The First Comics Superstar? work=imageandnarrative.be}}</ref>

==Films==

===Silent era and first talkies===
In 1915, Fields starred in two short comedies, Pool Sharks and His Lordships Dilemma, filmed in New York.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 103–105.</ref> His stage commitments prevented him from doing more movie work until 1924, when he played a supporting role in Janice Meredith, a Revolutionary War romance.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 106, 166.</ref> He reprised his Poppy role in a silent-film adaptation, retitled Sally of the Sawdust (1925) and directed by D. W. Griffith. His next starring role was in the Paramount Pictures film Its the Old Army Game (1926), which featured his friend Louise Brooks, later a screen legend for her role in G. W. Pabsts Pandoras Box (1929 film) Pandoras Box (1929) in Germany.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, p. 272.</ref> Fields 1926 film, which included a silent version of the porch sequence that would later be expanded in the sound film Its a Gift (1934), had only middling success at the box office.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, pp. 274–275.</ref> After Fields next two features for Paramount failed to produce hits, the studio teamed him with Chester Conklin for three features which were commercial failures and are now lost.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, pp. 280, 282, 286.</ref>

Fields wore a scruffy clip-on mustache in all of his silent films. According to the film historian William K. Everson, he perversely insisted on wearing the conspicuously fake-looking mustache because he knew it was disliked by audiences.<ref>Everson, William K. The Art of W.C. Fields. 1967, New York: Bonanza Books. p. 44.</ref>  Fields wore it in his first sound film, The Golf Specialist (1930)—a two-reeler that faithfully reproduces a sketch he had introduced in 1918 in the Follies<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, pp. 205, 312.</ref>—and finally discarded it after his first sound feature film, Her Majesty, Love (1931), his only Warner Bros. production.

===At Paramount===
In the sound era, Fields appeared in thirteen feature films for Paramount Pictures, beginning with Million Dollar Legs (1932 film) Million Dollar Legs in 1932. In that year he also was featured in a sequence in the anthology film If I Had a Million. In 1932 and 1933, Fields made four short subjects for comedy pioneer Mack Sennett, distributed through Paramount Pictures. These shorts, adapted with few alterations from Fields stage routines and written entirely by himself, were described by Simon Louvish as "the essence of Fields".<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, pp. 340–341.</ref> The first of them, The Dentist (1932 film) The Dentist, is unusual in that Fields portrays an entirely unsympathetic character: he cheats at golf, assaults his caddy, and treats his patients with unbridled callousness. William K. Everson says that the cruelty of this comedy made it "hardly less funny", but that "Fields must have known that The Dentist presented a serious flaw for a comedy image that was intended to endure", and showed a somewhat warmer persona in his subsequent Sennett shorts.<ref>Everson, William K. The Art of W.C. Fields. 1967, New York: Bonanza Books. p. 85.</ref>

The popular success of his next feature film, International House (1933 movie) International House (1933), established him as a major star.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, p. 362.</ref> A shaky outtake from the film, allegedly the only moving image record of the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, was later revealed to have been faked as a publicity stunt for the movie.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 259.</ref>

His 1934 classic Its a Gift included his stage sketch of trying to escape his nagging family by sleeping on the back porch and being bedeviled by noisy neighbors and salesmen. That film, like Youre Telling Me! and Man on the Flying Trapeze, ended happily with a windfall profit that restored his standing in his screen families.

He achieved a career ambition by playing the character Wilkins Micawber Mr. Micawber, in MGMs Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger David Copperfield in 1935.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, pp. 389–390.</ref> In 1936, Fields re-created his signature stage role in Poppy for Paramount Pictures.

In 1938 Fields excelled once again, this time in Paramounts sweeping musical variety anthology The Big Broadcast of 1938 while starring with Martha Raye, Dorothy Lamour and Bob Hope. In an unusual twist, Fields plays the roles of two nearly identical brothers (T. Frothingill Bellows and S. B. Bellow) and collaborated with several noted international musicians of the time including: Kirsten Flagstad (Norwegian opera soprano), Wilfred Pelletier (Canadian conductor of New Yorks Metropolitan Opera Orchestra), Tito Guizar (Mexican vocalist), Shep Fields (conducting his Rippling Rhythm Jazz Orchestra) and John Serry Sr. (Italian-American orchestral accordionist) <ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029912/ The Big Broadcast of 1938 on imdb.org]</ref> The film received critical acclaim and earned an Academy Award Oscar in 1939 for best music in an original song - Thanks for the Memory<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029912/awards?ref_=tt_awd The Big Broadcast f 1938 on imdb.org]</ref>

==Personal life==

The couple had a son, William Claude Fields, Jr. (July 28, 1904 &ndash; February 16, 1971)<ref>{{cite news  first=Vincent  last=Canby  authorlink=Vincent Canby  title=Son of W. C.

While performing in New York City at the New Amsterdam Theater in 1916, Fields met Bessie Poole, an established Ziegfeld Follies performer whose beauty and quick wit attracted him, and they began a relationship. With her he had another son, named William Rexford Fields Morris (August 15, 1917 – November 30, 2014).<ref>Gehring, W. D. (1994). Groucho and W.C. Fields Huckster comedians.

Fields met Carlotta Monti (1907–1993) in 1933, and the two began a sporadic relationship that lasted until his death in 1946.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, pp. 364–365, 472–473.</ref> Monti had small roles in two of Fields films, and in 1971 wrote a memoir, W.C. Fields and Me, which was made into a W.C. Fields and Me motion picture at Universal Studios in 1976. Fields was listed in the 1940 census as single and living at 2015 DeMille Drive (Cecil B. DeMille lived at 2000, the only other address on the street).

===Alcohol, dogs, and children===
Fields screen character often expressed a fondness for alcohol, a prominent component of the Fields legend. Fields never drank in his early career as a juggler, because he did not want to impair his functions while performing.  Eventually, the loneliness of constant travel prompted him to keep liquor in his dressing room as an inducement for fellow performers to socialize with him on the road. Only after he became a Follies star and abandoned juggling did Fields begin drinking regularly.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 116–117.</ref> His role in Paramount Pictures International House (1933 film) International House (1933), as an aviator with an unquenchable taste for beer, did much to establish Fields popular reputation as a prodigious drinker.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 260, 263.</ref> Studio publicists promoted this image, as did Fields himself in press interviews.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 264, 300.</ref>

Fields expressed his fondness for alcohol to Gloria Jean (playing his niece) in Never Give a Sucker an Even Break: "I was in love with a beautiful blonde once, dear. She drove me to drink. Thats the one thing I am indebted to her for."  Equally memorable was a line in the 1940 film My Little Chickadee:  "Once, on a trek through Afghanistan, we lost our corkscrew...and were compelled to live on food and water for several days."  The oft-repeated anecdote that Fields refused to drink water "because fish fuck in it" is unsubstantiated.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 230.</ref>

On movie sets Fields famously shot most of his scenes in varying states of inebriation.  During the filming of Tales of Manhattan (1942), he kept a vacuum flask with him at all times and frequently availed himself of its contents.  Phil Silvers, who had a minor supporting role in the scene featuring Fields, described in his memoir what happened next:

{{quote One day the producers appeared on the set to plead with Fields: "Please dont drink while were shooting—were way behind schedule" ... Fields merely raised an eyebrow.  "Gentlemen, this is only lemonade. For a little acid condition afflicting me." He leaned on me. "Would you be kind enough to taste this, sir?"  I took a careful sip—pure gin. I have always been a friend of the drinking man; I respect him for his courage to withdraw from the world of the thinking man. I answered the producers a little scornfully, "Its lemonade."  My reward?  The scene was snipped out of the picture.<ref>Silvers, P. This Laugh Is on Me: The Phil Silvers Story. Prentice-Hall (1973), p. 116. {{ISBN 0139191003}}</ref>
}}

In a testimonial dinner for Fields in 1939, the humorist Leo Rosten remarked of the comedian that "any man who hates dogs and babies cant be all bad".<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 392.</ref> The line—which Bartletts Familiar Quotations later erroneously attributed to Fields himself—became famous, and reinforced the popular perception that Fields hated children and dogs. In reality, Fields was somewhat indifferent to dogs, but occasionally owned one.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 393.</ref> He was fond of entertaining the children of friends who visited him, and doted on his first grandchild, Bill Fields III, born in 1943.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, p. 464.</ref> He sent encouraging replies to all of the letters he received from boys who, inspired by his performance in The Old Fashioned Way (film) The Old Fashioned Way, expressed an interest in juggling.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 293–294.</ref>

== Illness and career sideline ==
In 1936, Fields heavy drinking precipitated a significant decline in his health. By the following year he recovered sufficiently to make one last film for Paramount, The Big Broadcast of 1938, but his troublesome behavior discouraged other producers from hiring him. By 1938 he was chronically ill, and suffering from delirium tremens.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 355–70.</ref>

File:Chase and Sanborn Hour.jpg thumb Edgar Bergen and his dummy Charlie McCarthy with W.C. Fields on The Chase and Sanborn Hour
Physically unable to work in films, Fields was off the screen for more than a year. During his absence, he recorded a brief speech for a radio broadcast. His familiar, snide drawl registered so well with listeners that he quickly became a popular guest on network radio shows.<ref>[http://pappawsotr.com/wcfields.htm W.C. Fields Radio recordings] {{webarchive  url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615080148/http://pappawsotr.com/wcfields.htm  date=June 15, 2009 }}</ref> Although his radio work was not as demanding as motion-picture production, Fields insisted on his established movie star salary of $5,000 per week. He joined ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and Bergens dummy Charlie McCarthy on The Chase and Sanborn Hour for weekly insult-comedy routines.

Fields would twit Charlie about his being made of wood:
:Fields: "Tell me, Charles, is it true your father was a gate-leg table?"
:McCarthy: "If it is, your father was under it!"

When Fields would refer to McCarthy as a "woodpeckers pin-up boy" or a "termites flophouse", Charlie would fire back at Fields about his drinking:
:McCarthy: "Is it true, Mr. Fields, that when you stood on the corner of Hollywood and Vine, 43 cars waited for your nose to change to green?"
Another exchange:
:Bergen: "Why, Bill, I thought you didnt like children." 
:Fields: "Oh, not at all, Edgar, I love children. I can remember when, with my own little unsteady legs, I toddled from room to room..."
:McCarthy: "When was that, last night?"

During his recovery from illness, Fields reconciled with his estranged wife and established a close relationship with his son after Claudes marriage in 1938.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, p.426.</ref>

==Return to films==
Fields renewed popularity from his radio broadcasts with Bergen and McCarthy earned him a contract with Universal Pictures in 1939. His first feature for Universal, You Cant Cheat an Honest Man, carried on the Fields&ndash;McCarthy rivalry. In 1940, Fields made My Little Chickadee, with Mae West, and The Bank Dick, his best-known film, in which he has the following exchange with bartender Shemp Howard:
:Fields: "Was I in here last night, and did I spend a $20 bill?"
:Shemp: "Yeah."
:Fields: "Oh boy, what a load that is off my mind... I thought Id lost it!"

Fields fought with studio producers, directors, and writers over the content of his films. He was determined to make a movie his way, with his own script and staging, and his choice of supporting players. Universal finally gave him the chance, and the resulting film, Never Give a Sucker an Even Break (1941), was a masterpiece of absurd humor in which Fields appeared as himself, "The Great Man". Universals then-popuar singing star Gloria Jean played opposite Fields, and his cronies Leon Errol and Franklin Pangborn as his comic foils. Typically, the finished film was sufficienty surreal that Universal recut and reshot parts of it and ultimately released both the film and Fields. Sucker was Fields last starring film.

==Final years==
Fields fraternized at his home with actors, directors and writers who shared his fondness for good company and good liquor. John Barrymore, Gene Fowler, and Gregory La Cava were among his close friends. On March 15, 1941, while Fields was out of town, Christopher Quinn, the two-year-old son of his neighbors, actor Anthony Quinn and his wife Katherine DeMille, drowned in a lily pond on Fields property.  Grief-stricken over the tragedy, he had the pond filled in.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 434–435.</ref>

Fields had a substantial library in his home. Although a staunch atheist—or perhaps because of it—he studied theology and collected books on the subject.<ref name="Curtis_472">Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 472.</ref> According to a popular story (possibly apocryphal, according to biographer James Curtis), Fields told someone who caught him reading a Bible that he was "looking for loopholes".<ref name="Curtis_472"/>

In a 1994 episode of the Biography (TV series) Biography television series, Fields 1941 co-star Gloria Jean recalled her conversations with Fields at his home.  She described him as kind and gentle in personal interactions, and believed he yearned for the family environment he never experienced as a child.<ref>{{cite episode

During the 1940 presidential campaign, Fields authored a book, Fields for President, with humorous essays in the form of a campaign speech. Dodd, Mead and Company published it in 1940, with illustrations by Otto Soglow.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 415–416.</ref>  In 1971, when Fields was seen as an anti-establishment figure, Dodd, Mead issued a reprint, illustrated with photographs of the author.

Fields film career slowed considerably in the 1940s. His illnesses confined him to brief guest film appearances. An extended sequence in 20th Century Foxs Tales of Manhattan (1942) was cut from the original release of the film and later reinstated for some home video releases.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 454–456.</ref> The scene featured a temperance meeting with society people at the home of a wealthy society matron Margaret Dumont, in which Fields discovers that the punch has been spiked, resulting in drunken guests and a very happy Fields.

He enacted his famous billiard table routine for the final time for Follow the Boys, an all-star entertainment revue for the Armed Forces. (Despite the charitable nature of the movie, Fields was paid $15,000 for this appearance; he was never able to perform in person for the armed services.) In Song of the Open Road (1944), Fields juggled for a few moments, remarking, "This used to be my racket."<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 466.</ref> His last film, the musical revue Sensations of 1945, was released in late 1944. By then his vision and memory had so deteriorated that he had to read his lines from large-print blackboards.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, p. 471.</ref>

In 1944, Fields continued to make radio guest appearances, where script memorizations were unnecessary.  A notable guest slot was with Frank Sinatra on Sinatras CBS radio program on February 9, 1944.

Fields last radio appearance was on March 24, 1946, on the Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy Show on NBC. Just before his death that year, Fields recorded a spoken-word album, including his "Temperance Lecture" and "The Day I Drank a Glass of Water", at Les Pauls studio, where Paul had installed a new multi-track recorder. The session was arranged by one of his radio writers, Bill Morrow, and was Fields last performance.

Listening to one of Pauls experimental multi-track recordings, Fields remarked "The music youre making sounds like an octopus. Like a guy with a million hands. Ive never heard anything like it." Paul was amused, and named his new machine OCT, short for octopus.<ref>The Early Years of the Les Paul Legacy, 1915-1963 By Robb Lawrence. Hal Leonard Books, New York NY</ref>

==Death==
Fields spent the last 22 months of his life at the Las Encinas Sanatorium in Pasadena, California. In 1946, on Christmas Day—the holiday he said he despised—he had a massive gastric hemorrhage and died, aged 66.<ref>{{cite news  title=W.C.

===Gravestone===
File:W. C. Fields Grave.JPG thumb Niche of W. C. Fields in the Columbarium of Nativity in the Great Mausoleum, Forest Lawn Glendale.
A popular bit of Fields folklore maintains that his grave marker is inscribed, "Id rather be in Philadelphia"—or a close variant thereof. The legend originated from a mock epitaph written by Fields for a 1925 Vanity Fair (magazines) Vanity Fair article: "Here Lies / W.C. Fields / I Would Rather Be Living in Philadelphia."<ref>Reprinted in Vanity Fair: Selections from Americas Most Memorable Magazine, edited by Cleveland Amory and Frederic Bradlee, Viking Press (1960), pp. 102-3.</ref>  In reality, his interment marker bears only his stage name and the years of his birth and death.<ref name="Louvish_34">Louvish, S. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields. Faber & Faber (1999), p. 34.</ref>

==Comic persona and style==
In 1937, in an article in Motion Picture (magazine) Motion Picture magazine, Fields analyzed the characters he played:<blockquote>Youve heard the old legend that its the little put-upon guy who gets the laughs, but Im the most belligerent guy on the screen. Im going to kill everybody. But, at the same time, Im afraid of everybody—just a great big frightened bully .... I was the first comic in world history, so they told me, to pick fights with children. I booted Baby LeRoy ... then, in another picture, I kicked a little dog .... But I got sympathy both times. People didnt know what the unmanageable baby might do to get even, and they thought the dog might bite me.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 3–4.</ref></blockquote>

In features such as Its a Gift and Man on the Flying Trapeze, he is reported to have written or improvised more or less all of his own dialogue and material, leaving story structure to other writers.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 303–307, 331–332.</ref> He frequently incorporated his stage sketches into his films—e.g., the "Back Porch" scene he wrote for the Follies of 1925 was filmed in Its the Old Army Game (1926) and Its a Gift (1934);<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, pp. 247, 495.</ref> the golf sketch he performed in the lost film His Lordships Dilemma (1915) was re-used in the Follies of 1918, and in the films Sos Your Old Man (1926), The Golf Specialist (1930), The Dentist (1932), and Youre Telling Me (1934).<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, pp. 190, 205, 312.</ref>

Fields most familiar characteristics included a distinctive drawl, which was not his normal speaking voice.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, p. 313.</ref> His manner of muttering deprecatory asides was copied from his mother, who in Fields childhood often mumbled sly comments about neighbors who passed by.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, pp. 31, 346.</ref> He delighted in provoking the censors with double entendres and the near-profanities "Godfrey Daniels" and "mother of pearl". A favorite bit of "business", repeated in many of his films, involved his hat going astray—either caught on the end of his cane, or simply facing the wrong way— as he attempts to put it onto his head.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, p. 211.</ref>

In several of his films, he played hustlers, carnival barkers, and card sharps, spinning yarns and distracting his marks. In others, he cast himself as a victim: a bumbling everyman husband and father whose family does not appreciate him.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 3.</ref>

Fields often reproduced elements of his own family life in his films. By the time he entered motion pictures, his relationship with his estranged wife had become acrimonious, and he believed she had turned their son Claude—whom he seldom saw—against him.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, p. 191.</ref>  James Curtis says of Man on the Flying Trapeze that the "disapproving mother-in-law, Mrs. Neselrode, was clearly patterned after his wife, Hattie, and the unemployable mamas boy played by [Grady] Sutton was deliberately named Claude. Fields hadnt laid eyes on his family in nearly twenty years, and yet the painful memories lingered."<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 329.</ref>

===Unusual names===
Although lacking formal education, Fields was well read and a lifelong admirer of author Charles Dickens, whose characters unusual names inspired Fields to collect odd names he encountered in his travels, to be used for his characters.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 300.</ref>  Some examples are:
*"The Great McGonigle" (The Old-Fashioned Way);
*"Ambrose Wolfinger" [pointing toward "Wolf-whistling"] (Man on the Flying Trapeze);
*"Larson E. [read "Larceny"] Whipsnade", the surname taken from a dog track Fields had seen outside London<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 378.</ref> (You Cant Cheat an Honest Man), 
*"Egbert Sousé" [pronounced soo-ZAY, but pointing toward "souse", a synonym for a drunk] (The Bank Dick, 1940).

Fields often contributed to the scripts of his films under unusual pseudonyms. They include the seemingly prosaic "Charles Bogle", credited in four of his films in the 1930s; "Otis Criblecoblis", which contains an embedded homophone for "scribble"; and "Mahatma Kane Jeeves", a play on Mahatma and a phrase an aristocrat might use when about to leave the house: "My hat, my cane, Jeeves".<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 424.</ref>

===Supporting players===
Fields had a small cadre of supporting players that he employed in several films:
*Elise Cavanna, whose onscreen interplay with Fields was compared (by William K. Everson) to that between Groucho Marx and Margaret Dumont<ref>Everson, William K. (1967). The Art of W.C. Fields. New York: Bonanza Books. p. 81. {{ISBN 0-517-01232-4}}.</ref>
*Jan Duggan, an old-maid character (actually about Fields age).<ref>Jan Duggan (actress). [http://www.omnilexica.com/?q=Jan+Duggan+(actress) omnilexica.com]. Retrieved September 26, 2013.</ref> It was of her character that Fields said in The Old Fashioned Way, "Shes all dressed up like a well-kept grave."
*Kathleen Howard, as a nagging wife or antagonist
*Baby LeRoy, as a preschool child fond of playing pranks on Fields characters
*Franklin Pangborn, a fussy, ubiquitous character actor who played in several Fields films, most memorably as J. Pinkerton Snoopington in The Bank Dick
*Alison Skipworth, as his wife (although 16 years his senior), usually in a supportive role rather than the stereotypical nag
*Grady Sutton, typically a country bumpkin type, as a foil or an antagonist to Fields character
*Bill Wolfe, as a gaunt-looking character, usually a Fields foil
*Tammany Young, as a dim-witted, unintentionally harmful assistant, who appeared in seven Fields films until his sudden death from heart failure in 1936

==Unrealized film projects==
W. C. Fields was (with Ed Wynn) one of the two original choices for the title role in the 1939 version of The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) The Wizard of Oz. Fields was enthusiastic about the role, but ultimately withdrew his name from consideration so he could devote his time to writing You Cant Cheat an Honest Man.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 373–376.</ref>

Fields figured in an Orson Welles project. Welless bosses at RKO Radio Pictures, after losing money on Citizen Kane, urged Welles to choose as his next film a subject with more commercial appeal. Welles considered an adaptation of Charles Dickens The Pickwick Papers which would have starred Fields, but the project was shelved, partly because of contract difficulties,<ref>Rippy, Marguerite H. (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=2V7H0uvU5wsC&pg=PA66&lpg= Orson Welles and the Unfinished RKO Projects: A Postmodern Perspective]. SIU Press. p. 66. {{ISBN 0809329123}}.</ref> and Welles went on to adapt The Magnificent Ambersons (film) The Magnificent Ambersons.

During the early planning for his film Its a Wonderful Life, director Frank Capra considered Fields for the role of Uncle Billy, which eventually went to Thomas Mitchell (actor) Thomas Mitchell.<ref>Mell, Eila (2005). Casting might-have-beens: a film by film directory of actors considered for roles given to others. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland. p. 132. {{ISBN 0786420170}}.</ref>

==Influence and legacy==
A best-selling biography of Fields published three years after his death, W.C. Fields, His Follies and Fortunes by Robert Lewis Taylor, was instrumental in popularizing the idea that Fields real-life character matched his screen persona.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, p. 487.</ref> In 1973, the comedians grandson, Ronald J. Fields, published the first book to significantly challenge this idea, W. C. Fields by Himself, His Intended Autobiography, a compilation of material from private scrapbooks and letters found in the home of Hattie Fields after her death in 1963.<ref>Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, 1999, Faber & Faber, p. 11.</ref>

According to Woody Allen (in a New York Times interview from January 30, 2000), W. C. Fields is one of six "genuine comic geniuses" he recognized as such in movie history, along with Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Groucho and Harpo Marx, and Peter Sellers.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/30/arts/here-a-comic-genius-there-a-comic-genius.html?pagewanted=1 title=Here A Comic Genius, There A Comic Genius date=January 30, 2000 work=New York Times}}</ref>

The Surrealism Surrealists loved Fields absurdism and anarchistic pranks. Max Ernst painted a Project for a Monument to W.C. Fields (1957), and René Magritte made a Hommage to Mack Sennett (1934).

Fields is one of the figures that appears in the crowd scene on the cover of The Beatles 1967 album Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.

The United States Postal Service issued a W.C. Fields commemorative stamp on the comedians 100th birthday, in January 1980.<ref>Curtis, James. W.C. Fields: A Biography. New York: A. Knopf, 2003, pp. 491–492.</ref>

===Caricatures and imitations===
*The character Horatio K. Boomer in the Fibber McGee and Molly radio show had a persona and delivery very much like the characters portrayed by W.C. Fields.
*A caricature of Fields appears in the Lucky Luke comic book album Western Circus (Lucky Luke) Western Circus and again in the animated feature La Ballade des Dalton Lucky Luke: The Ballad of the Daltons.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWVZALDUd7c title=Lucky Luke - Ballad Of the Daltons (1978) - English 4/8 date=October 17, 2009 work=YouTube}}</ref> 
*Cartoonist Al Hirschfeld portrayed Fields in caricature many times, including the book cover illustrations for Drat!, A Flask of Fields, and Godfrey Daniels! – all edited by Richard J. Anobile.{{citation needed date=July 2013}}
*The TV show Gigglesnort Hotel featured a puppet character named "W. C. Cornfield" who resembled Fields in appearance and voice.<ref>Woolery, George W. (1983). Childrens television, the first thirty-five years, 1946–1981. Metuchen, N.J.: Scarecrow Press. p. 199. {{ISBN 0810815575}}.</ref>
*Impressionist Rich Little often imitated Fields on his TV series The Kopycats, and he used a Fields characterization for the Ebenezer Scrooge character in his HBO special Rich Littles Christmas Carol (1978), a one-man presentation of A Christmas Carol.
*A 1960s Canadian cartoon series for kids Tales of the Wizard of Oz featured a Wizard with a voice imitation of Fields, a nod to the real-life choice of Fields to play the Wizard in the 1939 film classic opposite Judy Garland.
* Fields is among the many celebrities caricatured in the 1936 Merrie Melodies short The Coo-Coo Nut Grove. 
* Fields is seen sitting on the spectators bench in the Disney cartoon Mickeys Polo Team (1936). 
* He appears as W.C. Fieldmouse in the Merrie Melodies short The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos (1937).

* One episode of The Flintstones featured a tramp who gets old clothes belonging to Fred from his wife Wilma, then when Fred attempts to take back a coat, is trounced with the tramps cane. The tramp has Fields voice and persona.
*A character on How Can You Be In Two Places At Once When Youre Not Anywhere At All by the Firesign Theatre features a character who speaks like W.C. Fields.
*The Wizard of Id comic strip contains a shady lawyer character, a Fields caricature named "Larsen E. Pettifogger".
*In the second series of the TV drama Gangsters (TV series) Gangsters a character named the White Devil is introduced, who styles himself W.D. Fields affecting the vocal mannerisms and appearance of W.C. Fields to confuse and confound his enemies. Played by series writer Philip Martin (screenwriter) Philip Martin, he himself is credited in the final episode as "Larson E. Whipsnade" after Fields character in You Cant Cheat an Honest Man.
* Actor Bob Leeman portrayed Fields in the 1991 movie The Rocketeer (film) The Rocketeer.
* In 1971 Frito-Lay replaced the Frito Bandito TV ad campaign with one featuring W.C. Fritos, a round, top-hat wearing character modeled on the movie persona of Fields. Also, circa 1970 Sunkist Growers produced a series of animated TV ads featuring the "Sunkist Monster," whose voice was an impression of Fields performed by Paul Frees.
*Canadian actor Andrew Chapman played W.C Fields in a vaudeville-themed episode of "Murdoch Mysteries" in season 8, titled "The Keystone Constables".
*Comedian Mark Proksch impersonates Fields in a number of On Cinema episodes, included the series Second Annual Oscar Special.
