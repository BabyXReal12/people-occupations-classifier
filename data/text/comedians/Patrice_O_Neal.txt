"Ive seen him give people money to leave," recalls Gregg Hughes Gregg "Opie" Hughes.<ref name="O&A1">The Opie and Anthony Show, November 30, 2011, Sirius XM Satellite Radio</ref> 

At times he would encourage people to call out to the stage to set up a punchline. "Ladies, how would you keep your man if you lost your vagina?," ONeal would ask of his audience. When the women would invariably reference oral and anal sex, the comedian would respond, "See, I gave you the chance to talk and you qualified yourself as a series of holes."<ref name="dead-frog.com"/>
