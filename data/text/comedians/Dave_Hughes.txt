==Career==
===Comedy===
After leaving university, it was seven years before Hughes found work as a stand-up comedian and he did a variety of jobs including working at an abattoir, as a bricklayers labourer and a shop assistant.
After dreaming about being a comedian since he was a youngster, his first comedy gig came at age 22 when he was living in Perth doing labouring jobs and he decided, "Im going to have a crack". Appearing onstage he acknowledges that he was "just horrible" but after three attempts over six months he gained his confidence and went on to become a headline act.
He is a regular performer at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Some of his shows have been released on CD (Dave Hughes: Whatever), and on DVD (Dave Hughes, Live, Dave Hughes - Handy
and David Hughes - Pointless).

===Television===
Hughes co-hosted the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ABC comedy talk show The Glass House (2001 TV series) The Glass House along with Wil Anderson and Corinne Grant. However, it was axed in 2006 amid political controversy.
He has had guest spots on television programs The Fat, Rove (TV series) Rove Live, The Panel (Australian TV series) The Panel, Thank God Youre Here, Under Melbourne Tonight
, Spicks and Specks (TV series) Spicks &amp; Specks and Have You Been Paying Attention?.

In the AFL season he is a part of the Network Ten Saturday night show Before The Game alongside Mick Molloy, Lehmo, Andy Maher and Neroli Meadows.

Hughes worked on Australian television show Rove (TV series) Rove in 2007, with a weekly "Hughesy Loses It" segment. In 2008–09, the segment evolved into a recurring segment known as "Help me Hughesy," where he would rant about a given topic.
On 20 July 2009, Hughes began co-hosting the half-hour Channel 10 show The 7PM Project, which later expanded to become the hour-long The Project.  His regular co-hosts were Charlie Pickering, and Carrie Bickmore. In June 2011, Hughes was one of the few people to be granted a one-on-one interview with the Dalai Lama during his visit to Australia.
In December 2013, Hughes resigned from his full-time position on The Project to return to stand-up comedy. Hughes will, however, appear once a week on the show from wherever he is around the country. Hughes is quoted as saying, "Its definitely a tough decision, as we have had so many unbelievable moments on the desk. You meet some of the biggest stars in the world and chat with them and have some wonderful times". Hughes later said in an interview in 2016 that he left The Project stating "The news cycle rarely changes. Nothing changes in so long. To sit there and talk about the same things every night, it was too much."
Hughes will begin a year-long round of stand-up engagements around Australia, in Adelaide in February 2014, where he and his family will be based for five weeks before moving onto other venues.

Later that year, when interviewed on Enough Rope with Andrew Denton, Sandilands said of Hughes, "I hate him – the next time I see him Im going to punch him in the throat."
Hughes retorted by releasing an official apology, which said in part that Hughes was "sincerely and deeply sorry that Kyle Sandilands is a massive dickhead" and that "massive dickheads have the same rights as normal people."
