She attended the exclusive University Liggett School in Detroit (it began its relocation to Grosse Pointe later that{{which? date=June 2018}} year). Toward the end of her life, Radner wrote in her autobiography, Its Always Something, that during her childhood and young adulthood, she battled numerous eating disorders: "I coped with stress by having every possible eating disorder from the time I was nine years old. I have weighed as much as 160 pounds and as little as 93. When I was a kid, I overate constantly. My weight distressed my mother and she took me to a doctor who put me on Dextroamphetamine Dexedrine diet pills when I was ten years old."<ref>{{cite book author=Radner, Gilda title=Its Always Something location= New York publisher= Simon and Schuster date= 1989 page= 97}}</ref>

Radner graduated from Liggett and enrolled at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Michigan Ann Arbor in 1964.{{cn date=June 2018}}

==Career==
In Ann Arbor, Radner dropped out in her senior year<ref name="something">{{cite book author=Radner, Gilda title=Its Always Something location= New York publisher= Simon & Schuster date= 1989}}</ref> to follow her boyfriend, Canadian sculptor Jeffrey Rubinoff, to Toronto, where she made her professional acting debut in the 1972 production of Godspell with future stars Eugene Levy, Andrea Martin, Victor Garber, Martin Short, and Paul Shaffer. Afterward, Radner joined The Second City comedy troupe in Toronto.

Radner was a featured player on the National Lampoon, Incorporated National Lampoon Radio Hour, a comedy program syndicated to some 600 U.S. radio stations from 1974 to 1975. Fellow cast members included John Belushi,<ref name="NPR">{{cite web title=The National Lampoon Radio Hour url=https://www.npr.org/2003/11/17/1505048/the-national-lampoon-radio-hour website=NPR.org accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref> Chevy Chase,<ref name="NPR" /> Richard Belzer, Bill Murray, Brian Doyle-Murray, and Rhonda Coullet.{{citation needed date=January 2017}}

===Saturday Night Live===
Radner gained name recognition as one of the original "Not Ready for Prime Time Players", the freshman group on the first (1975) season of Saturday Night Live. She was the first performer cast for the show,<ref name="obit"/> co-wrote much of the material that she performed, and collaborated with Alan Zweibel (of the shows writing staff) on sketches that highlighted her recurring characters.<ref name="zweibel">{{cite book author=Zweibel, Alan title=Bunny Bunny: Gilda Radner location= New York publisher= Villard date= 1994}}</ref> Between 1975 and 1980, she created characters such as obnoxious personal advice expert Roseanne Roseannadanna and "Baba Wawa", a parody of Barbara Walters. After Radners death, Walters stated in an interview that Radner was the "first person to make fun of news anchors, now its done all the time."<ref>{{YouTube LQvRFrpKi-0 Barbara Walters being interviewed about Gilda Radner }}</ref>

She also played the character Emily Litella, an elderly, hearing-impaired woman who gave angry and misinformed editorial replies on "Weekend Update".<ref name="obit"/> Additionally, Radner parodied celebrities such as Lucille Ball, Patti Smith, and Olga Korbut in SNL sketches. She won an Emmy Award in 1978 for her work on SNL.  In Rolling Stone{{}}s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 SNL cast members to date, Radner was ranked ninth in importance.  "[Radner was] the most beloved of the original cast," they wrote. "In the years between Mary Tyler Moore and Seinfelds Elaine, Radner was the prototype for the brainy city girl with a bundle of neuroses."<ref>{{cite news magazine=Rolling Stone issue =1229 date= February 26, 2015 page= 32 title=SNL cast members}}</ref>

Radner battled Bulimia nervosa bulimia while on the show. She had a relationship with SNL castmate Bill Murray, with whom she worked at the National Lampoon, which ended badly. Few details of their relationship or its end were made public. In Its Always Something, this is the one reference Radner made to Murray in the entire book: "All the guys [in the National Lampoon group of writers and performers] liked to have me around because I would laugh at them till I peed in my pants and tears rolled out of my eyes. We worked together for a couple of years creating The National Lampoon Show, writing The National Lampoon Radio Hour, and even working on stuff for the magazine. Bill Murray joined the show and Richard Belzer&nbsp;..."<ref>{{cite book author=Radner, Gilda title=Its Always Something location= New York publisher=Simon and Schuster date= 1989 pages=100–101}}</ref>

In 1979, incoming NBC President Fred Silverman offered Radner her own primetime variety show, which she turned down.<ref name="something"/> That year, she was a host of the Music for UNICEF Concert at the United Nations General Assembly.{{citation needed date=January 2017}}

Alan Zweibel, who co-created the Roseanne Roseannadanna character and co-wrote Roseannes dialogue, recalled that Radner, one of three original SNL cast members who stayed away from cocaine, chastised him for abusing it.<ref name="zweibel"/>

While in character as Roseanne Roseannadanna, Radner gave the commencement address to the graduating class at the Columbia School of Journalism in 1979.<ref>{{cite web url=http://journalistfightclub.blogspot.com/2008/04/roseanne-roseannadanna-vs-columbia.html title=-journalist FIGHTclub website=Journalist Fight Club}}</ref>

Radner had mixed emotions about the fans and strangers who recognized her in public. She sometimes became "angry when she was approached [by strangers in public], and upset when she wasnt," according to the book by Hill and Weingrad.<ref name="history">Hill, Doug and Jeff Weingrad.

===Work in theater, a record album and her first movie===
In 1979, Radner appeared on Broadway theatre Broadway in the successful one-woman show, Gilda Radner - Live From New York.<ref name="ibdb">{{IBDB name 5910}}</ref> The show featured material that was racier than NBC censors allowed on Saturday Night Live, such as the song "Lets Talk Dirty to the Animals". In 1979, shortly before Radners final season on Saturday Night Live, her Broadway show was filmed by Mike Nichols under the title Gilda Live, co-starring Paul Shaffer and Don Novello, and the movie was released in theaters nationwide in 1980, with poor results. A soundtrack album was also unsuccessful. During the Broadway production, Radner met her first husband, G. E. Smith, a musician who worked on the show. They were married in a civil ceremony in 1980.<ref name="something"/>

In the fall of 1980, after all original SNL cast members departed from the show, Radner began working with actor Sam Waterston in the Jean Kerr play Lunch Hour.  They played two people whose spouses are having an affair, and as a reaction they start their own relationship consisting of trysts on their lunch hour.<ref>{{cite book author=Hischak, Thomas S.  title=American Theatre: A Chronicle of Comedy and Drama, 1969–2000 publisher= Oxford University Press date= 2001 isbn= 0-19-512347-6}}</ref> The show ran for more than seven months in various theaters in the United States, including the John F.

== Personal life==
Radner was first married to musician G. E. Smith, they divorced in 1982.<ref>https://www.timeinc.net/time/4502772/gene-wilder-gilda-radner-romance</ref><ref>{{cite web url=https://gesmithmusic.com/about/ title=Bio date=May 13, 2010 publisher=}}</ref> Radner met actor Gene Wilder on the set of the Sidney Poitier film Hanky Panky (1982 film) Hanky Panky (released in 1982), when the two worked together making the film. She described their first meeting as "love at first sight".<ref name="something"/> She was unable to control her attraction to Wilder as her marriage to guitarist G. E. Smith deteriorated. Radner went on to make a second film with Wilder, The Woman in Red (1984 film) The Woman in Red (released in 1984), and their relationship grew. The two were married on September 18, 1984, in Saint-Tropez.<ref name="something"/>  The pair made a third film together, Haunted Honeymoon (released in 1986)<ref name="something"/> and remained married until her death in 1989.

Details of Radners eating disorder were reported in a book about Saturday Night Live by Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad,<ref name="history" />  The book by Hill and Weingrad was published and received much media coverage during a period when Radner was consulting various doctors in Los Angeles about her symptoms of illness that turned out to be cancer.

==Illness==
File:GildaRadner-walkoffame.jpg thumb right Radners star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame
In 1985, Radner was experiencing severe fatigue and suffered from pain in her upper legs on the set of Haunted Honeymoon in the United Kingdom. She sought medical treatment, and for a period of 10 months, various doctors, most of them in Los Angeles, gave her several diagnoses that all turned out to be wrong because she continued to experience pain.<ref name="something"/>

During those 10 months, she faced hardships such as the publication of Hill and Weingrads highly publicized book about Saturday Night Live, which provided many details about her eating disorder<ref name="history"/><ref name="something"/> as well as the financial failure of Haunted Honeymoon, which grossed only $8,000,000 in the United States, entering the box office at number 8, then slipping to 14 the following week. As Radner wrote in Its Always Something, "On July 26 [1986], Haunted Honeymoon opened nationwide. It was a bomb. One month of publicity and the movie was only in the theaters for a week – a box-office disaster."<ref name="something"/>

Finally, on October 21, 1986, Radner was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer stage IV ovarian cancer.<ref name="something"/><ref name="cr">{{cite web author=Song, Jenny url=http://www.crmagazine.org/archive/spring%202009/Pages/AmericasFunnyGirl.aspx  title=Americas Funny Girl website= CRMagazine.org date= Spring 2009}}</ref> "She immediately underwent surgery and had a hysterectomy," wrote Jenny Song in a 2009 magazine article published by the American Association for Cancer Research.<ref name="cr"/> On October 26, "surgeons removed a grapefruit-size tumor from her abdomen," the article continued. Radner then began chemotherapy and radiation therapy treatment, as she wrote in Its Always Something, and the treatment caused extreme physical and emotional pain.<ref name="something"/>

After her diagnosis, the National Enquirer ran the headline "Gilda Radner In Life-Death Struggle" in its following issue.  Without asking for her comment,<ref name="something"/> the editors of the publication asserted that she was dying. Radner wrote in Its Always Something:  "They found an old photo of me looking frightened from a Saturday Night Live sketch and blew that up to make the point. What they did probably sold newspapers, but it had a devastating effect on my family and my friends.  It forced Gene [Wilder] to compose a press release to respond.  He said that I had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, had had surgery, and my prognosis was good.  The Enquirer doesnt like good news, so the Gilda Radner story stopped running."<ref name="something"/>

Four months after her ordeal with the National Enquirer, Radner saw her Saturday Night Live castmates one last time at Laraine Newmans 35th birthday party (in March 1987).  According to Bill Murray<ref>{{cite book last=Shales first=Tom title=Live From New York: An Uncensored History Of Saturday Night Live year=2010 isbn=0-316-73565-5 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aNDb1d2i9KkC&lpg=PT317&vq=Gilda%20got%20married%20and%20went%20away&pg=PT318#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> when he heard she was leaving the party, he and Dan Aykroyd carried her around the Los Angeles house where the party was held, repeatedly saying goodbye to everyone.  Since all the guests were comedians, they all did comedy bits with her repeatedly.

===Remission===
After Radner was told that she had gone into Cure#Remission remission, she wrote Its Always Something (a catchphrase of her character Roseanne Roseannadannas),<ref name="something"/> which included details of her struggle with the illness. Life (magazine) Life did a March 1988 cover story on her illness, titled "Gilda Radners Answer to Cancer: Healing the Body with Mind and Heart."
In 1988, Radner guest-starred on Its Garry Shandlings Show on Fox Broadcasting Company Fox TV, to critical acclaim. When Shandling asked her why she had not been seen in public for a while, she replied, "Oh, I had cancer. What did you have?" Shandlings reply: "A very bad series of career moves&nbsp;... which, by the way, theres no treatment for whatsoever."  She repeated on-camera Mark Twains apocryphal saying,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.snopes.com/quotes/twain.asp title=Mark Twain on Coldest Winter publisher=Snopes.com date=September 26, 2007 accessdate=June 8, 2012}}</ref> "Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated." Radner planned to host an episode of Saturday Night Live Saturday Night Live (season 13) that year,{{citation needed date=January 2017}} but a 1988 Writers Guild of America strike writers strike caused the delay of the network television season.

===Illness and death===
In September 1988, after tests showed no signs of cancer, Radner went on a maintenance chemotherapy treatment to prolong her remission, but three months later, in December, she learned the cancer had returned.<ref name="cr"/> She was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on May 17, 1989, to undergo a CT scan. She was given a sedative and went into a coma during the scan.<ref>{{cite news last1=Karras first1=Steve title=Gilda Radner Remembered url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-karras/gilda-radner-club_b_2366303.html accessdate=3 April 2018 publisher=Huffington Post date=January 6, 2013}}</ref> She did not regain consciousness and died three days later, from ovarian cancer on May 20, 1989; Wilder was at her side.<ref name="obit">{{cite news author=Hevesi, Dennis url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFD81230F932A15756C0A96F948260  title=Gilda Radner, 42, Comic Original Of Saturday Night Live Zaniness newspaper=The New York Times date= May 21, 1989}}</ref>

News of her death broke as Steve Martin was rehearsing to act as the guest host for that nights season finale of Saturday Night Live. The shows performers and crew, including Lorne Michaels, Phil Hartman, and Mike Myers (who had, in his own words, "fallen in love" with Radner after playing her son in a BC Hydro commercial on Canadian television and considered her the reason he wanted to be on SNL),<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/mike-myers/biography/86?page=2 title=Mike Myers biography website=Talktalk.co.uk accessdate=July 26, 2014}}</ref> had not known how grave her situation was. Martins planned opening monologue was scrapped; in its place Martin, in tears, introduced a video clip of a 1978 sketch in which he and Radner had parodied Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse in a well-known dance routine from The Band Wagon (1953).<ref>{{cite book url=http://vimeo.com/82820975 authors=Martin Steve & Radner, Gilda title=Saturday Night Live date=1978 edition=Vimeo video accessdate=March 20, 2015 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129085851/http://vimeo.com/82820975 archivedate=November 29, 2014 df=mdy-all}}</ref> After the clip, Martin said it reminded him of "how great she was and of how young I looked. Gilda, we miss you."

==Legacy==
File:Cedars-Sinai West.jpg alt= thumb Cedars-Sinai Medical Center hosts the Gilda Radner Ovarian Detection Center
Wilder established the Gilda Radner Hereditary Cancer Program<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/Patients/Programs-and-Services/Hereditary-Cancer-Program/ title=Hereditary Cancer Program (Gilda Radner Hereditary Cancer Program) - Cedars-Sinai publisher=}}</ref> at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Cedars-Sinai to screen high-risk candidates (such as women of Ashkenazi Jews Ashkenazi Jewish descent) and to run basic diagnostic tests. He testified before a Congressional committee that Radners condition had been misdiagnosed and that if doctors had inquired more deeply into her family background they would have learned that her grandmother, aunt, and cousin all died of ovarian cancer, and therefore they might have attacked the disease earlier.<ref>Wilder, Gene. "Why Did Gilda Die?" People Magazine, June 3, 1991.</ref>

Radners death helped raise awareness of early detection of ovarian cancer and the connection to familial epidemiology.<ref>Squires, Sally. "Fighting Ovarian Cancer: Doctors Dont Know Who Is At Risk and Why", Washington Post, May 30, 1989.</ref> The media attention in the two years after Radners death led to registry of 450 families with familial ovarian cancer at the Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry, a research database registry at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York. The registry was later renamed the Gilda Radner Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry (GRFOCR).<ref>[http://www.ovariancancer.com Gilda Radner Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry website]; accessed March 19, 2015.</ref> In 1996, Gene Wilder and Registry founder Steven Piver, one of Radners medical consultants, published Gildas Disease: Sharing Personal Experiences and a Medical Perspective on Ovarian Cancer.

In 1991, Gildas Club, a network of affiliate clubhouses where people living with cancer, their friends, and families, can meet to learn how to live with cancer, was founded by Joanna Bull, Radners cancer Psychotherapy psychotherapist, along with Radners widower, Gene Wilder (also a cancer survivor) and broadcaster Joel Siegel (who later died after a long battle with cancer). The first club opened in New York City in 1995. The organization took its name from Radners comment that cancer gave her "membership to an elite club Id rather not belong to".<ref>{{cite web title=Gildas Club Twin Cities: Who We Are work=Website publisher=gildasclubtwincities.org url=http://www.gildasclubtwincities.org/whoweare/faqs accessdate=November 28, 2012}}</ref> Radners story can be read in her book, Its Always Something.<ref name="something"/>
