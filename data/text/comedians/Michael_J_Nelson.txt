==Career==

===Mystery Science Theater 3000===
Nelson was working as a waiter at T.G.I. Fridays and doing occasional stand-up comedy when he was offered a job on Mystery Science Theater 3000, typing the suggestions in the writing room. The writers told him to feel free to make some comments on the movies they were watching, and Nelson impressed them so much with his wit and comedic timing that they made him a staff writer, and, later, head writer. Nelson also appeared frequently in the shows host segments, often playing characters from the movies being mocked such as Torgo from the infamous Manos - The Hands of Fate.

When series originator and host Joel Hodgson decided to leave the show half-way through the fifth season, he chose Nelson as his replacement, reportedly because he thought Nelson was a natural leader, a gifted comedian, and a gifted muse, and also because Nelson simply looked good standing next to the shows puppets.{{citation needed date=June 2016}} Nelson remained in the host role for another five and a half seasons until the shows final Sci-Fi Channel episode aired in 1999.

===Post-MST3K===
Since the series ended, Nelson has worked steadily as a writer, publishing several books (as of March 2006): Mike Nelsons Movie Megacheese, Mike Nelsons Mind Over Matters and Mike Nelsons Death Rat!, the last being his first novel. His other works include a series of pop-culture humor books, Happy Kitty Bunny Pony, Goth-Icky, and Love Sick, as well as a monthly column for Home Theater Magazine. He also wrote for the short-lived game show Lets Bowl, which gained a cult following of its own. He has commentary tracks for DVD releases of several films, including Reefer Madness, The Little Shop of Horrors, House on Haunted Hill, Plan 9 from Outer Space, Carnival of Souls, and Night of the Living Dead. With his MST3K co-stars Kevin Murphy (actor) Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett, he was part of a comedy team called "The Film Crew", which has created comedy segments for National Public Radio. The first Film Crew DVD, Hollywood After Dark, was released July 10, 2007, and three more followed in the months after.
