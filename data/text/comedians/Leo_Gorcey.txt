Leo Bernard Gorcey (June 3, 1917<ref>Social Security Death Index</ref>– June 2, 1969) was an United States American stage and movie actor who became famous for portraying the leader of the group of young hooligans known variously as the Dead End Kids, East Side Kids The East Side Kids, and as an adult, The Bowery Boys. Always the most pugnacious member of the gangs in which he participated, young Leo was the filmic prototype of the young punk. He was the shortest member of the original gang.

==Early years==
Gorcey was born in New York City, on June 3, 1917. The son of 16-year-old Josephine (née Condon), an  Irish Catholic immigrant, and 31-year-old Bernard Gorcey, a Russian Jews Russian Jewish immigrant, both vaudeville vaudevillian actors as well as small people. Bernard Gorcey was {{cvt 4 ft 10 in}}, and his wife was {{cvt 4 ft 11 in}}; as an adult, Leo would reach {{cvt 5 ft 6 in}}.

==Film career==
In the 1930s, Leos father became estranged from the family while working in theater and film. When he returned in 1935, he and Leos brother, David, persuaded Leo to try out for a small part in the play Dead End. Having just lost his job as a plumbers apprentice and seeing his fathers relative success, Leo decided to give acting a try. Leo and David were cast as two members of the East 53rd Place Gang (originally dubbed the "2nd Avenue Boys" in the play Dead End published by playwright Sydney Kingsley) with limited stage time. Charles Duncan, who was originally cast as Spit, left the play, and Leo, his understudy, was promoted. Gorcey created a quarrelsome guttersnipe whose greatest joy was in making trouble.

In 1937 in film 1937, Samuel Goldwyn made the popular play into a Dead End (1937 film) movie of the same name and transported the six rowdy boys to Hollywood. Gorcey became one of the busiest actors in Hollywood for the next 20 years.
*From 1937 to 1939 in film 1939, he starred in 7 Dead End Kids movies where he played characters with various names
*From 1940 in film 1940 to 1945 in film 1945, he starred in 21 East Side Kids movies where he played the character named Ethelbert "Muggs" McInnis/McGinnis/Maloney
*From 1946 in film 1946 to 1956 in film 1956, he starred in 41 The Bowery Boys Bowery Boys movies where he played the character named Terence Aloysius "Slip" Mahoney

In the The Bowery Boys Bowery Boys movies, Leos father, Bernard Gorcey, played Louie Dumbrowski, the diminutive sweetshop owner from whom the boys conned banana splits and financial loans.  Leos character "Slip" was famed for his malapropisms always delivered in a Brooklyn accent, such as "a clever seduction" for "a clever deduction", "I depreciate it!" ("I appreciate it!"), "I regurgitate" ("I reiterate"), and "optical delusion" ("optical illusion")."

In 1939, Gorcey married 17-year-old dancer Kay Marvis, who appeared in four of his Monogram movies. They divorced in 1944, after which Kay met Groucho Marx and very soon after, became Grouchos wife. In 1949, Gorcey married Amelita Ward, with whom he had worked in Clancy Street Boys and Smugglers Cove. She gave birth to Leo Gorcey, Jr., during their marriage.

Also in 1944, Gorcey had a recurring role in the Pabst Blue Ribbon Town radio show, starring Groucho Marx.  In 1948, Gorcey played a small role in the sophisticated movie comedy So This Is New York starring acerbic radio and television comedian Henry Morgan (comedian) Henry Morgan and featuring Arnold Stang.

In 1955, after his father was killed in an automobile accident, Gorcey began abusing alcohol and lost a great deal of weight. When he trashed a movie set in an intoxicated rage, the studio refused to give him the pay raise he demanded, so he quit the Bowery Boys and was replaced in the last seven movies by Stanley Clements. Leos brother David remained with the series until it ended in early 1958.

During the 1960s, Leo did very little acting. He did appear in the epic 1963 comedy, Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, in a bit part.  Gorcey then made two final appearances on film with Huntz Hall in a pair of low budget productions: Second Fiddle To A Steel Guitar (1966) and The Phynx (1970).

==Life after acting==
In 1967, Gorcey published his autobiography, entitled An Original Dead End Kid Presents: Dead End Yells, Wedding Bells, Cockle Shells, and Dizzy Spells.  In 2003, Gorceys son Leo, Jr., published a book about his father, entitled Me and the Dead End Kid  In 2017, a third book on his life, Leo Gorceys Fractured World was published by Jim Manago and examines his use of malaprops in his Bowery Boys films.
