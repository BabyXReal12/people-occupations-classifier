In 1902, at the age of ten, he joined a troupe of circus tumblers known as the Five Marvelous Ashtons, who toured the country on both the circus and vaudeville circuits. Later he became a professional baseball player. Despite his skill, he declined an opportunity to sign with the New York Yankees to pursue his career as an entertainer. After three seasons he returned to the circus, then went into Vaudeville and finally starred on Broadway (Manhattan) Broadway. He gradually added comedy to his act, and transformed himself into a comedian. He moved to Broadway in the 1920s, first appearing in the musical comedy Jim Jam Jems.

In late 1928, Brown began making films, starting the next year with Warner Bros. He quickly became a favorite with child audiences,<ref name=NYT1/> and shot to stardom after appearing in the first all-color all-talking musical comedy On with the Show (1929 film) On with the Show (1929). He starred in a number of lavish Technicolor Warner Brothers musical comedies including: Sally (1929 film) Sally (1929), Hold Everything (1930 film) Hold Everything (1930), Song of the West (1930), and Going Wild (1930). By 1931, Joe E. Brown had become such a star that his name was billed above the title in the films in which he appeared.

He appeared in Fireman, Save My Child (1932 film) Fireman, Save My Child (1932), a comedy in which he played a member of the St. Louis Cardinals, and in Elmer, the Great (1933) with Patricia Ellis and Claire Dodd and Alibi Ike (1935) with Olivia de Havilland, in both of which he portrayed ballplayers with the Chicago Cubs.

In 1933 he starred in Son of a Sailor (film) Son of a Sailor with Jean Muir (actress) Jean Muir and Thelma Todd. In 1934, Brown starred in A Very Honorable Guy with Alice White and Robert Barrat, in The Circus Clown again with Patricia Ellis and with Dorothy Burgess, and with Maxine Doyle in Six-Day Bike Rider.

Brown was one of the few vaudeville comedians to appear in a Shakespeare film; he played Francis Flute in the Max Reinhardt/William Dieterle film version of Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream (1935 film) A Midsummer Nights Dream (1935) and was highly praised for his performance.<ref name=NYT1/> He starred in Polo Joe (1936) with Carol Hughes (actress) Carol Hughes and Richard "Skeets" Gallagher, and in Sons o Guns. In 1933 and 1936, he became one of the top ten earners in films.

Joe E. Browns other two sons were in the military service. In 1942 Browns son, Captain Don E. Brown, was killed when his A-20 Havoc crashed near Palm Springs, California.<ref name=cdt>{{cite news  coauthors=  title=Capt. Don Brown, Actors Son, Dies In Bomber Crash.  url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/468627642.html?dids=468627642:468627642&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&date=Oct+09%2C+1942&author=&pub=Chicago+Daily+Tribune&desc=CAPT.+DON+BROWN%2C+ACTORS+SON%2C+DIES+IN+BOMBER+CRASH&pqatl=google  quote=  work=Chicago Tribune  date=October 9, 1942  accessdate=April 17, 2008 }}</ref>  At 50, Brown himself was too old to enlist, but he traveled thousands of miles at his own expense to entertain American troops. He was the first to do so, traveling to both the Caribbean and Alaska before Bob Hope had, and before the USO was organized.

"While big USO names like Bob Hope did not visit the Leyte, Philippine area my father was in (housing was not good), Leyte received any number of entertainers during the war.  Dad said the entertainers were all just a bunch of nice people.  One group in particular was the top actors from a very popular and large musical of the times.  Dad and a few of his buddies would walk back to the tents that housed the USO performers and would visit with them.  Mostly, the USO performers were curious about the events on the islands and how the men were handling things.  One performer, a "wonderful comedian" named Joe E. Brown, would commandeer a military vehicle and be driven around the island.  The entertainer would stop military pedestrians, "ream" them for some inconsequential matter, start laughing, then invite them into the cab so they could be driven to their destinations.  Joe E. Brown was greatly appreciated."  (Memories of Capt. Donald Courtright, told to his daughter Mary in 2011.){{citation needed date=November 2014}}

On his return to the States, he brought sacks of letters, making sure they were delivered by the Post Office Department.  He gave shows in all weather conditions, many in hospitals, sometimes doing his entire show for a single dying soldier.  He would sign autographs for everyone.  Brown was one of only two civilians to be awarded the Bronze Star in WWII.

==Postwar work==
His concern for the troops continued into the Korean War, as evidenced by a newsreel featuring his appeal for blood donations to aid the US and UN troops there that was featured in the season 4 episode of M*A*S*H (TV series) M*A*S*H titled "Deluge".<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0638293/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast</ref>

In 1948, he was awarded a Special Tony Award for his work in the touring company of Harvey (play) Harvey.<ref name=NYT1/><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1948 title=1948 Tony Award Winners (BroadwayWorld.com) work=broadwayworld.com accessdate=April 11, 2015}}</ref>

He had a cameo appearance in Around the World in Eighty Days (1956 film) Around the World in 80 Days (1956), as the Fort Kearney stationmaster talking to Fogg (David Niven) and his entourage in a small town in Nebraska. In the similarly epic film Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), he cameoed as a union official giving a speech at a construction site in the climactic scene. On television, he was the mystery guest on Whats My Line? during the January 11, 1953, episode.

His best known postwar role was that of aging millionaire Osgood Fielding III in Billy Wilders 1959 comedy, Some Like It Hot. Fielding falls for Daphne (Jerry), played by Jack Lemmon in drag; at the end of the film, Lemmon takes off his wig and reveals to Brown that he is a man, to which Brown responds; "well, nobodys perfect", one of the most celebrated punchlines in film history.

Another of his notable postwar roles was that of "Capn Andy Hawkes" in MGMs 1951 remake of Show Boat, a role that he reprised onstage in the 1961 New York City Center revival of the musical and on tour. The musical film version included such prominent costars as Ava Gardner, Howard Keel, and Kathryn Grayson. Brown performed several dance routines in the film, and famed choreographer Gower Champion appeared along with first wife Marge Champion Marge.  Browns final film appearance was in The Comedy of Terrors (1964).

Brown was a sports enthusiast, both in film and personally. Some of his best films were the "baseball trilogy" which consisted of Fireman, Save My Child (1932), Elmer the Great (1933) and Alibi Ike (1935).

Brown, inherited an interest in baseball, becoming the general manager (baseball) general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates for more than twenty years. Brown also spent Ty Cobb Ty Cobbs last days with him before he died, discussing his life.

Browns sports enthusiasm also led to him becoming the first president of PONY Baseball and Softball (at the time named Pony League) when the organization was incorporated in 1953. He continued in the post until late 1964, when he retired. Later he traveled additional thousands of miles telling the story of PONY League, hoping to interest adults in organizing baseball programs for young people.

He was caricatured in the Disney cartoons Mickeys Gala Premiere (1933), Mother Goose Goes Hollywood (1938), and The Autograph Hound (1939); all of them contain a scene in which he is seen laughing so loud that his mouth opens extremely wide.
