==Career==

===Stand-up comedy===
Evans rose to fame during the 1990s with loud, hot, sweaty, energetic stage performances and physical observational comedy. His slapstick humour has led to comparisons with Sir Norman Wisdom, though Evans does not regard Wisdom as an influence.<ref name="telegraph">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3626118/%27All-I%27ve-ever-felt-on-stage-is-pain%27.html All Ive ever felt on stage is pain], Daily Telegraph, 25 October 2004, "I saw his films as a kid. It surprises me because if you watch my act its nothing like his really."</ref> In his earlier work, he used a dysfunctional character called Malcolm to illustrate unusual characters. In 1993, he won the if.comedy award Perrier Comedy Award for his work at the Edinburgh Festival.<ref>{{cite web title=if.comedy – Past winners.  url=http://www.if.com/eddies/past-winners.html  publisher=if.comedy  accessdate=27 February 2008  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928194054/http://www.if.com/eddies/past-winners.html  archivedate=28 September 2007  df= }}</ref>

Evans sweat drenches him on stage. During most of his headlining performances, he often takes an intermission, during which he has a quick shower and changes into a different suit. He has also said that his suits are regularly thrown away after three performances, mainly because of the sweat, with dry-cleaners refusing to handle them.<ref>{{cite video title=Lee Evans interview url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QiTXF0uMcI date=31 October 2007 work=Daily Mirror location=UK  accessdate=27 February 2008}}</ref> In November 2005, Evans broke the world record for a solo act performing to the biggest comedy audience, performing to 10,108 people at the Manchester Arena.<ref>{{cite news title=Comic Evans breaks crowd record url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4454572.stm date=20 November 2005 publisher=BBC News accessdate=27 February 2008}}</ref>
