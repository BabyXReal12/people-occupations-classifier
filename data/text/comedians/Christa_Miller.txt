==Career==
Millers first role on television was in Kate & Allie, which starred her real-life aunt, Susan Saint James, whom she resembles. She then appeared in episodes of Northern Exposure, Fresh Prince of Bel Air, and Party of Five. She had a small role in the horror film Stepfather III (1992) with Priscilla Barnes. Miller later appeared twice on Seinfeld, as two different characters. In the 1993 episode "The Sniffing Accountant", she played the boss of George Costanza. She had intended to be a dramatic actress, and this role proved to be a turning point for Miller, who realized how much she enjoyed comedy. Two years later, she returned to Seinfeld in "The Doodle" to play Georges girlfriend, Paula. This episode proved to be a boon to her career, as she convinced co-creator Larry David to provide her with a rough-cut video of the still-unaired episode when she auditioned for The Drew Carey Show, whose producers had initially thought she was too inexperienced. Davids support helped Miller win over the producers of The Drew Carey Show,<ref>Rizzo, Carita.

McGinley) acerbic ex-wife Jordan Sullivan. Originally, the character was intended to appear in only one episode; in season 2, the role became recurring. When her young cousin Teddy Ebersol, son of Susan St. James and Dick Ebersol, died in a plane crash in 2004, Scrubs dedicated the season-4 episode "My Lucky Charm (Scrubs) My Lucky Charm" to him. Miller also was the voice of Cleopatra (Clone High) Cleopatra in the short-lived animated show Clone High. She had a leading role in the 2008 two-part TV miniseries The Andromeda Strain (miniseries) The Andromeda Strain. She also appeared in the CSI: Miami episode Divorce Party (CSI: Miami) Divorce Party .
