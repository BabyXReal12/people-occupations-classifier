In 1992, Johnny Carson retired, and many fans believed that Letterman would become host of The Tonight Show. When NBC instead gave the job to Jay Leno, Letterman departed NBC to host his own late-night show on CBS, opposite The Tonight Show at 11:30&nbsp;p.m., called the Late Show with David Letterman. The new show debuted on August 30, 1993, and was taped at the historic Ed Sullivan Theater, where Ed Sullivan broadcast his The Ed Sullivan Show eponymous variety series from 1948 to 1971.

But while the expectation was that Letterman would retain his unique style and sense of humor with the move, Late Show was not an exact replica of his old NBC program. Recognizing the more formal mood (and wider audience) of his new time slot and studio, Letterman eschewed his trademark blazer with khaki pants and white wrestling shoes wardrobe combination in favor of expensive shoes, tailored suits and light-colored socks. The monologue was lengthened. Paul Shaffer and the Worlds Most Dangerous Band followed Letterman to CBS, but they added a brass section and were rebranded the CBS Orchestra (Shaffers request); a small band had been mandated by Carson while Letterman occupied the 12:30 slot. Additionally, because of intellectual property disagreements, Letterman was unable to import many of his Late Night segments verbatim,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.oocities.org/davidletterman82/TimeAugust1993Article.html work=Time title=Stupid Talk Show Tricks  author=Richard Corliss  date=August 2, 1993 accessdate=December 8, 2011}}</ref> but he sidestepped this problem by simply renaming them (the "Top Ten List" became the "Late Show Top Ten", "Viewer Mail" became the "CBS Mailbag", etc.) Time (magazine) Time magazine stated that "Lettermans innovation ... gained power from its rigorous formalism", as his biographer Jason Zinoman puts it, he was "a fascinatingly disgruntled eccentric trapped inside a more traditional talk show."<ref>[http://time.com/4728313/david-letterman-jason-zinoman/ "Letterman: A TV Traditionalist With a Weird Streak"] by Daniel DAddario, Time (magazine) Time,  April 17, 2017, p.&nbsp;56</ref>

=== Popularity ===
The main competitor of the Late Show was NBCs The Tonight Show, which was The Tonight Show with Jay Leno hosted by Jay Leno for 22 years<!--Letterman started after Leno-->, but from June 1, 2009, to January 22, 2010, was The Tonight Show with Conan OBrien hosted by Conan OBrien. In 1993 and 1994, the Late Show consistently gained higher ratings than The Tonight Show. But in 1995, ratings dipped and Lenos show consistently beat Lettermans in the ratings from the time that Hugh Grant came on Lenos show after Grants arrest for soliciting a prostitute;<ref>{{cite news url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-10-07/entertainment/letterman.show.ratings_1_local-people-meters-rating-points-viewers?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ title=Viewers still in Lettermans corner publisher=CNN author=Breeanna Hare date=October 7, 2009 accessdate=February 5, 2012 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314045142/http://articles.cnn.com/2009-10-07/entertainment/letterman.show.ratings_1_local-people-meters-rating-points-viewers?_s=PM%3ASHOWBIZ archivedate=March 14, 2012}}</ref>

Leno typically attracted about five&nbsp;million nightly viewers between 1999 and 2009. The Late Show lost nearly half its audience during its competition with Leno, attracting 7.1&nbsp;million viewers nightly in its 1993–94 season and about 3.8&nbsp;million per night as of Lenos departure in 2009.<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2009/05/31/conan_obriens_time_has_come__will_the_leno_faithful_follow title=11:35pm&nbsp;— Conan OBriens time has come.

=== Hosting the Academy Awards ===
On March 27, 1995, Letterman acted as the host for the 67th Academy Awards ceremony. Critics blasted Letterman for what they deemed a poor hosting of the Oscars, noting that his irreverent style undermined the traditional importance and glamor of the event.<ref name="John OConnor">{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/29/movies/critic-s-notebook-the-winner-isn-t-david-letterman.html title=The Winner Isnt David Letterman work=The New York Times author=John OConnor date=March 29, 1995 accessdate=December 8, 2011}}</ref> In a joke about their unusual names (inspired by a celebrated comic essay in The New Yorker, "Yma Dream" by Thomas Meehan), he started off by introducing Uma Thurman to Oprah Winfrey, and then both of them to Keanu Reeves: "Oprah...Uma. Uma...Oprah," "Have you kids met Keanu?" This and many of his other jokes fell flat.<ref name="John OConnor" /> Although Letterman attracted the highest ratings to the annual telecast since 1983, many felt that the bad publicity garnered by Lettermans hosting caused a decline in the Late Shows ratings.<ref name="RS">{{cite news first=Fred last=Schruers title= Dave vs. Dave: Forget Leno & Koppel&nbsp;— Letterman May Be His Own Worst Enemy work=Rolling Stone date=May 30, 1996 url=http://www.geocities.com/davidletterman82/RollingStone1996Interview.html archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127145433/http://www.geocities.com/davidletterman82/RollingStone1996Interview.html archivedate=November 27, 2007}}</ref>

Letterman recycled the apparent debacle into a long-running gag. On his first show after the Oscars, he joked, "Looking back, I had no idea that thing was being televised." He lampooned his stint two years later, during Billy Crystals opening Oscar skit, which also parodied the plane-crashing scenes from that years chief nominated film, The English Patient (film) The English Patient.

For years afterward, Letterman recounted his hosting the Oscars, although the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences continued to hold Letterman in high regard and they had invited him to host the Oscars again.<ref name="NF">{{cite news first=Nikki last=Finke title= The 411 about David Letterman & Oscar work=Deadline Hollywood Daily date=February 25, 2008 url=http://www.deadline.com/2008/02/the-411-about-david-letterman-oscar/}}</ref><ref name=Bruce>{{cite web last=Keller first=Joel work=A.V.

=== Heart surgery hiatus ===
On January 14, 2000, a routine check-up revealed that an artery in Lettermans heart was severely obstructed. He was rushed to emergency surgery for a coronary artery bypass surgery quintuple bypass.<ref>{{cite news url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/15/nyregion/artery-blocked-letterman-has-heart-bypass-surgery.html?sec=health title = Artery Blocked, Letterman Has Heart Bypass Surgery  work = The New York Times  date = January 15, 2000  accessdate = March 23, 2009   first=Tina   last=Kelley}}</ref>

During the initial weeks of his recovery, reruns of the Late Show were shown and introduced by friends of Letterman including Drew Barrymore,<ref name="Whos loyal" /> Ray Romano, Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt, Megan Mullally, Bill Murray, Regis Philbin, Charles Grodin, Nathan Lane, Julia Roberts,<ref name="Whos loyal" /> Bruce Willis, Jerry Seinfeld, Martin Short, Steven Seagal, Hillary Clinton, Danny DeVito, Steve Martin, and Sarah Jessica Parker.

Subsequently, while still recovering from surgery, Letterman revived the late night tradition that had virtually disappeared on network television during the 1990s of guest hosts by allowing Bill Cosby, Kathie Lee Gifford, Dana Carvey, Janeane Garofalo, and others to host new episodes of the Late Show.

Upon his return to the show on February 21, 2000, Letterman brought all but one of the doctors and nurses on stage who had participated in his surgery and recovery (with extra teasing of a nurse who had given him bed baths—"This woman has seen me naked!"),<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.popstarsplus.com/celebrities_davidletterman.htm  title=David Letterman biography  publisher=Popstarsplus.com  accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref> including Dr. O. Wayne Isom and physician Louis Aronne, who frequently appeared on the show. In a show of emotion, Letterman was nearly in tears as he thanked the health care team with the words "These are the people who saved my life!" The episode earned an Emmy Award Emmy nomination.

For a number of episodes, Letterman continued to crack jokes about his bypass, including saying, "Bypass surgery: its when doctors surgically create new blood flow to your heart. A bypass is what happened to me when I didnt get The Tonight Show! Its a whole different thing." In a later running gag he lobbied his home state of Indiana to rename the freeway circling Indianapolis (Interstate 465 I-465) "The David Letterman Bypass." He also featured a montage of faux news coverage of his bypass surgery, which included a clip of Lettermans  heart for sale on the Home Shopping Network. Letterman became friends with his doctors and nurses. In 2008, a Rolling Stone interview stated <blockquote>he hosted a doctor and nurse whod helped perform the emergency quintuple-bypass heart surgery that saved his life in 2000. These are people who were complete strangers when they opened my chest, he says. And now, eight years later, theyre among my best friends.<ref name="rs2008" /></blockquote>

Additionally, Letterman invited the band Foo Fighters to play "Everlong",<ref name="mtvfoo">{{cite web title=Foo Fighters To Welcome Letterman Back To Late Show url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429027/20000216/foo_fighters.jhtml last=Basham first=David publisher=MTV date=February 16, 2000 accessdate=June 5, 2010}}</ref> introducing them as "my favorite band, playing my favorite song."<ref name="salonfoo">{{cite web title=The top 10 reasons David Lettermans heart bypass operation was a good thing url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/col/mill/2000/03/20/letterman last=Millman first=Joyce work=Salon (website) Salon date=March 20, 2000 accessdate=June 5, 2010 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211201550/http://www.salon.com/entertainment/col/mill/2000/03/20/letterman archivedate=February 11, 2011}}</ref> During a later Foo Fighters appearance, Letterman said that Foo Fighters had been in the middle of a South American tour which they canceled to come play on his comeback episode.{{citation needed date=December 2017}}

Letterman again handed over the reins of the show to several guest hosts (including Bill Cosby, Brad Garrett, Whoopi Goldberg,<ref name=EW2003>{{cite news   last=Susman   first=Gary   date=March 10, 2003   title=Late Show returns, with guest hosts for still-ill Dave   publisher=Entertainment Weekly   url=http://www.ew.com/article/2003/03/10/late-show-returns-guest-hosts-still-ill-dave   access-date=July 3, 2016}}</ref> Elvis Costello,<ref name=EW2003/> John McEnroe, Vince Vaughn,<ref name=EW2003/> Will Ferrell,<ref name=EW2003/> Bonnie Hunt, Luke Wilson and bandleader Paul Shaffer) in February 2003, when he was diagnosed with a severe case of shingles. Later that year, Letterman made regular use of guest hosts—including Tom Arnold (actor) Tom Arnold and Kelsey Grammer—for new shows broadcast on Fridays. In March 2007, Adam Sandler—who had been scheduled to be the lead guest—served as a guest host while Letterman was ill with a stomach virus.<ref>{{cite news url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/arts/television/20cnd-letterman.html?ex=1175313600&en=e887f76d9783d7e7&ei=5070 title = Letterman is Ill, so Guest Takes Over Late Show  work = The New York Times date = March 20, 2007  accessdate = March 29, 2007   first=Bill   last=Carter}}</ref>

=== Re-signing with CBS ===

In March 2002, as Lettermans contract with CBS neared expiration, American Broadcasting Company ABC offered him the time slot for long-running news program Nightline with Ted Koppel. Letterman was interested as he believed he could never match Lenos ratings at CBS due to Lettermans complaint of weaker lead-ins from the networks 11 OClock News late local news programs, but was reluctant to replace Koppel.<ref name="battle">"[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20141116023540/http://www.aetv.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=562114 The Battle for Late Night]" A&E Network, April 27, 2010.</ref> Letterman addressed his decision to re-sign on the air, stating that he was content at CBS and that he had great respect for Koppel.

On December 4, 2006, CBS revealed that Letterman signed a new contract to host Late Show with David Letterman through the fall of 2010. "Im thrilled to be continuing on at CBS," said Letterman. "At my age you really dont want to have to learn a new commute."<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/650213242/Dave-will-outlast-Jay.html  title=Dave will outlast Jay  date= December 8, 2006  first=Scott D.  last= Pierce  newspaper= Deseret News}}</ref> Letterman further joked about the subject by pulling up his right pants leg, revealing a tattoo, presumably temporary, of the ABC logo.

"Thirteen years ago, David Letterman put CBS late night on the map and in the process became one of the defining icons of our network," said Leslie Moonves, president and CEO of CBS Corporation. <blockquote>His presence on our air is an ongoing source of pride, and the creativity and imagination that the Late Show puts forth every night is an ongoing display of the highest quality entertainment.

According to a 2007 article in Forbes magazine, Letterman earned {{US$ 40}}&nbsp;million a year.<ref>{{cite news url = https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/53/07celebrities_David-Letterman_C8CO.html title = #17 David Letterman   work=Forbes   date=June 14, 2007}}</ref> A 2009 article in The New York Times, however, said his salary was estimated at {{US$ 32}}&nbsp;million per year.<ref name="nyt09carter" />  In June 2009, Lettermans Worldwide Pants and CBS reached agreement to continue the Late Show until at least August 2012.

On the February 3, 2011, edition of the Late Show with David Letterman Late Show, during an interview with Howard Stern, Letterman said he would continue to do his talk show for "maybe two years, I think."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.tv.com/is-david-letterman-ready-to-be-done-with-the-late-show/story/25084.html  title=Is David Letterman Ready to be Done with the Late Show?  first=Seth  last=Abramovitch  date=February 4, 2011  publisher=TV.com  quote=Dave tried valiantly to change the subject to Sterns new Sirius deal, rumored to be worth even more than the $500&nbsp;million contract he signed with them in 2005.

It also featured cameos from The Simpsons and Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show) Wheel of Fortune (the latter with a puzzle saying "Good riddance to David Letterman"), a Top Ten List of "things I wish I could have said to David Letterman" performed by regular guests including Alec Baldwin, Barbara Walters, Steve Martin, Jerry Seinfeld, Jim Carrey, Chris Rock, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Peyton Manning, Tina Fey, and Bill Murray, and closed with a montage of scenes from both his CBS and NBC series set to a live performance of "Everlong" by Foo Fighters.

The final episode of Late Show with David Letterman was watched by 13.76&nbsp;million viewers in the United States with an audience share of 9.3/24, earning the show its highest ratings since following the 1994 Olympics on February 25, 1994, and the shows highest demo numbers (4.1 in adults 25–54 and 3.1 in adults 18–49) since Oprah Winfreys first Late Show appearance following the ending of her feud with Letterman on December 1, 2005.

=== NBC and Johnny Carson ===
In spite of Johnny Carsons clear intention to pass his title to Letterman, NBC selected Jay Leno to host The Tonight Show after Carsons departure.<ref>{{cite news  work=The Independent date=January 24, 2005 title=Johnny Carson, king of late-night chat, dies at 79  url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/johnny-carson-king-of-latenight-chat-dies-at-79-488063.html  accessdate=July 6, 2009   location= London}}</ref> Letterman maintained a close relationship with Carson through his break with NBC. Three years after he left for CBS, HBO produced a made-for-television movie called The Late Shift (film) The Late Shift, based on a book by The New York Times reporter Bill Carter, chronicling the battle between Letterman and Leno for the coveted Tonight Show hosting spot.

Carson later made a few cameo appearances as a guest on Lettermans show. Carsons final television appearance came May 13, 1994, on a Late Show episode taped in Los Angeles, when he made a surprise appearance during a Top Ten list (David Letterman) Top 10 list segment. In early 2005, it was revealed that Carson occasionally sent jokes to Letterman, who used these jokes in his monologue; according to CBS senior vice president Peter Lassally (a one-time producer for both men), Carson got "a big kick out of it."<ref>{{cite news   url = http://www.deseretnews.com/article/600106891/TV-critics-genuinely-fond-of-Carson.html  title= TV critics genuinely fond of Carson   date = January 24, 2005   first = Scott D.   last = Pierce   accessdate = February 27, 2012 work = Deseret News}}</ref> Letterman would do a characteristic Johnny Carson golf swing after delivering one of Carsons jokes. In a tribute to Carson, all of the opening monologue jokes during the first show following Carsons death were written by Carson.

Lassally also claimed that Carson had always believed Letterman, not Leno, to be his "rightful successor."<ref>{{cite news  work=Fox News title=Letterman Gets Jokes From Carson date=January 20, 2005  url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/01/20/letterman-gets-jokes-from-carson.html  accessdate=May 19, 2015}}</ref> During the early years of the Late Show{{}}s run, Letterman occasionally used some of Carsons trademark bits, including "Carnac the Magnificent" (with Paul Shaffer as Carnac), "Stump the Band", and the "Week in Review."

=== Oprah Winfrey ===
Oprah Winfrey appeared on Lettermans show when he was hosting NBCs Late Night on May 2, 1989.  Following that appearance, the two had a 16-year feud<ref>{{cite news last=Bauderap  first= David  url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/television/free-lunch-behind-16-year-letterman-oprah-feud/story-e6frfmyi-1225932672545  title=Free lunch behind 16-year Letterman, Oprah feud  publisher=News.com.au  date=October 1, 2010  accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref> which arose, as Winfrey explained to Letterman after the feud had been resolved, as a result of the acerbic tone of their 1989 interview of which she said that it "felt so uncomfortable to me that I didnt want to have that experience again".

The feud apparently ended in 2005 when Winfrey appeared on CBSs Late Show with David Letterman on December 2, in an event Letterman jokingly referred to as "the Super Bowl of Love".<ref>{{cite web url=https://tv.yahoo.com/show/32704/news/urn:newsml:tv.ap.org:20070830:people_winfrey_letterman__ER:1759  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906075743/http://tv.yahoo.com/show/32704/news/urn%3Anewsml%3Atv.ap.org%3A20070830%3Apeople_winfrey_letterman__ER%3A1759  archivedate=September 6, 2007  publisher=Yahoo!  title=Letterman to appear on `Oprah  deadurl=yes  df= }}</ref>

Winfrey and Letterman also appeared together in a Late Show promo that aired during CBSs coverage of Super Bowl XLI in February 2007, with the two sitting next to each other on the couch watching the game. Since the game was played between the Indianapolis Colts and Chicago Bears, the Indianapolis-born Letterman wears a Peyton Manning jersey, while Winfrey—whose show was taped in Chicago—wears a Brian Urlacher jersey.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_i5we6MB-w publisher=YouTube title=Dave and Oprahs Super Bowl of Love}}</ref> On September 10, 2007, Letterman made his first appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

Three years later, during CBSs coverage of Super Bowl XLIV, the two appeared again in a Late Show promo, this time with Winfrey sitting on a couch between Letterman and Jay Leno. This time Letterman was wearing the retired {{Abbr No. Number}} 70 jersey of Colts Hall of Fame and Letterman regular guest, Art Donovan (the Colts faced the New Orleans Saints in this Super Bowl). The appearance was Lettermans idea: Leno flew to New York City on an NBC corporate jet, sneaking into the Ed Sullivan Theater during the Late Shows February 4 taping wearing a disguise, meeting Winfrey and Letterman at a living room set created in the theaters balcony where they taped their promo.<ref>{{cite news  title= How the Letterman-Oprah-Leno Super Bowl Ad Came Together   url= http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/how-the-letterman-oprah-leno-super-bowl-ad-came-together/   publisher=Media Decoder   date=  February 7, 2010   accessdate=February 8, 2010   first= Bill  last=Carter}}</ref>

=== Palin joke ===
On June 8 and 9, 2009, Letterman told two sexually themed jokes about a daughter (never named) of Sarah Palin on his TV show.<ref name="NOW">{{cite news url  =http://www.now.org/issues/media/hall-of-shame/index.php/television/letterman-palin-daughter  title = Letterman "Jokes" About Palins Daughter  author = Lisa Bennett  publisher = National Organization for Women NOW  date = June 11, 2009  accessdate = April 27, 2012 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615051330/http://www.now.org/issues/media/hall-of-shame/index.php/television/letterman-palin-daughter archivedate=June 15, 2009}}</ref> Palin was in New York City at the time with her then fourteen-year-old daughter, Willow, and some contemporaries thought the jokes to be aimed at Willow, which caused some small amount of controversy.<ref name="NOW"/>

In a statement posted on the Internet, Palin said, "I doubt [Letterman would] ever dare make such comments about anyone elses daughter" and that "laughter incited by sexually perverted comments made by a 62-year-old male celebrity aimed at a 14-year-old girl is disgusting."<ref name="Palin vs. Letterman – ABC News">{{cite news url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2009/06/palin-vs-letterman title=Palin vs. Letterman author=Caitlin Taylor publisher=ABC News date=June 11, 2009 accessdate=April 27, 2012 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216043242/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2009/06/palin-vs-letterman archivedate=February 16, 2012}}</ref> On his show of June 10, Letterman responded to the controversy, saying the jokes were meant to be about Palins eighteen-year-old daughter, Bristol Palin Bristol, whose pregnancy as an unmarried teenager had caused some controversy during the United States presidential election of 2008.

I would never, never make jokes about raping or having sex of any description with a 14-year-old girl."<ref name="Palin vs. Letterman – ABC News"/>

His remarks did not put an end to public criticism, however. The National Organization for Women (NOW) released a statement supporting Palin, noting that Letterman had made "[only] something of an apology."<ref name="NOW"/> When the controversy failed to subside, Letterman addressed the issue again on his show of June 15, faulting himself for the error and apologizing "especially to the two daughters involved, Bristol and Willow, and also to the governor and her family and everybody else who was outraged by the joke."<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/15/AR2009061503131.html?hpid=topnews title=One Pregnant-Teen Joke Too Many?

On more than one occasion, he said that he had once been a "horrible alcoholic" and had begun drinking around the age of 13 and continued until 1981 when he was 34. He recounts in 1981, "I was drunk 80% of the time. ... I loved it. I was one of those guys, I looked around, and everyone else had stopped drinking and I couldnt understand why."<ref>{{cite av media url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmQcHhV9ChM&t=3m49s title=This video is unavailable. work=youtube.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBF8LIr8RG4&t=7m34s title=Amanda Seyfried al David Letterman 12-12-2012 date=December 13, 2012 work=YouTube}}</ref> When he is shown drinking on the Late Show (or, before that, on Late Night) what appears to be alcohol, it is actually replaced with apple juice by the crew.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/late_show/wahoo_gazette/160277/ title=That aint apple juice.

===Stalker===
Beginning in May 1988, Letterman was stalking stalked by Margaret Mary Ray, a woman suffering from schizophrenia. She stole his Porsche, camped out on his tennis court, and repeatedly broke into his house. Her exploits drew national attention, with Letterman occasionally joking about her on his show, although he never referred to her by name. After she committed suicide in October 1998, Letterman told The New York Times that he had great compassion for her.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/22/nyregion/behind-jokes-life-pain-delusion-for-letterman-stalker-mental-illness-was-family.html title=For Letterman Stalker, Mental Illness Was Family Curse and Scarring Legacy work=The New York Times first=Frank last=Bruni date=November 22, 1998 accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> A spokesperson for Letterman said: "This is a sad ending to a confused life."<ref>Stewart, Babara, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/07/nyregion/the-woman-who-stalked-letterman-is-a-suicide.html "The Woman Who Stalked Letterman Is a Suicide"], The New York Times, October 7, 1998; retrieved September 11, 2013.</ref>

On October 1, 2009, Letterman announced on his show that he had been the victim of a blackmail attempt by someone threatening to reveal that hed had sex with several of his female employees, and at the same time, he confirmed that he had such relationships.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/10/david-letterman-on-extortion-attempt-i-felt-menaced-by-this.html  title=David Letterman on extortion attempt: I felt menaced by this  first=Matea  last=Gold  newspaper=Los Angeles Times  date= October 2, 2009}}</ref> He stated that three weeks earlier (on September 9, 2009) someone had left a package in his car with material he said he would write into a screenplay and a book if Letterman did not pay him {{US$ 2}}&nbsp;million.

A central figure in the case and one of the women with whom Letterman had had a sexual relationship was his longtime personal assistant Stephanie Birkitt, who often appeared with him on his show.

In the days following the initial announcement of the affairs and the arrest, several prominent women, including Kathie Lee Gifford, co-host of NBCs Today (NBC program) Today Show, and NBC news anchor Ann Curry questioned whether Lettermans affairs with subordinates created an unfair working environment.<ref name=bauder>{{cite news title=Will women viewers turn away from Letterman? agency=Associated Press date=October 4, 2009 accessdate=October 4, 2009  url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/33167148/ns/today-entertainment/t/will-women-viewers-turn-away-letterman}}</ref> A spokesman for Worldwide Pants said that the companys sexual harassment policy did not prohibit sexual relationships between managers and employees.<ref name=latimesharassment>{{cite news url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-letterman3-2009oct03-story.html title=David Letterman affair is no joke first1=Matea last1=Gold first2=Scott last2=Collins date=October 3, 2009 accessdate=October 4, 2009 newspaper=Los Angeles Times quote=We have a written policy in our employee manual that covers harassment, the spokesman said in a statement.

===Foo Fighters===
Letterman shares a close relationship with the rock and roll band Foo Fighters since their appearance on his first show upon his return from heart surgery (see section "Heart surgery hiatus" for more information).  The band appeared many times on the Late Show (see section "Retirement from Late Show" for more information), including a week-long stint in October 2014.

While introducing the bands performance of "Miracle (Foo Fighters song) Miracle" on the show of October 17, 2014, Letterman told the story of how a souvenir video of himself and his four-year-old son learning to ski used the song as background music, unbeknownst to Letterman until he saw it.  He said "This is the second song of theirs that will always have great, great meaning for me for the rest of my life".  This was the first time the band had heard this story.<ref>{{cite web title=Foo Fighters – Miracle [Live on David Letterman] url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x284e70 website=dailymotion publisher=Dailymotion accessdate=December 29, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web last1=Bradley first1=Laura title=A Brief History of David Letterman’s Love for the Foo Fighters url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2015/05/21/a_brief_history_of_david_letterman_s_love_for_the_foo_fighters.html website=Brow Beat publisher=The Slate group accessdate=December 29, 2017}}</ref>
