Milton Berle (born Mendel Berlinger; July 12, 1908 – March 27, 2002) was an American comedian and actor. Berles career as an entertainer spanned over 80 years, first in silent films and on stage as a child actor, then in radio, movies and television. As the host of NBCs Texaco Star Theater (1948–55), he was the first major American television star<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/business/technology/story/1336054.html "Broadcast pioneer NBC prepares for cable takeover"] Miami Herald, Nov. 16, 2009</ref> and was known to millions of viewers as "Uncle Miltie" and "Mr. Television" during Golden Age of Television TVs golden age.

==Early life==
Milton Berle was born into a Jewish<ref>{{cite web author=Gary Baum title=L.A.s Power Golf Clubs: Where the Hollywood Elite Play date=June 23, 2011 url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/las-power-golf-clubs-hollywood-205072 work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> family in a five-story walkup at 68 118th Street (Manhattan) W. 118th Street in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan. His given name was Mendel Berlinger.<ref name="jewish virtual library" /><ref name="jns org" /> He chose Milton Berle as his professional name when he was 16. His father, Moses Berlinger (1873–1938), was a paint and varnish salesman. His mother, Sarah (Sadie) Glantz Berlinger (1877–1954),<ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2CQeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NpgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5278,3741070&dq=milton+berle+son&hl=en title=Milton Berles Mother Dies date=1 June 1954 publisher=The Tuscaloosa News accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref> changed her name to Sandra Berle when Milton became famous. He had three older brothers (from oldest to youngest): Phil , Frank and Jack Berle. For many years the latter two worked as Berles TV production staff members, while Phil Berle was a program executive at NBC.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju5CCTAJMq8 title=Milton Berle Interview (1956) date=1956 publisher=YouTube accessdate=10 August 2018}}</ref>

==Child actor==
Berle entered show business at the age of five when he won an amateur talent contest.<ref name="childwonder">"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,853738,00.html The Child Wonder]". Time, 16 May 1949.</ref> He appeared as a child actor in silent films, beginning with The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial) The Perils of Pauline, filmed in Fort Lee, New Jersey.<ref name="tvmuseum">{{cite web url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/berlemilton/berlemilton.htm title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications – Encyclopedia of Television work=museum.tv}}</ref> The director told Berle that he would portray a little boy who would be thrown from a moving train. In Milton Berle: An Autobiography, he explained, "I was scared shitless, even when he went on to tell me that Pauline would save my life. Which is exactly what happened, except that at the crucial moment they threw a bundle of rags instead of me from the train. I bet there are a lot of comedians around today who are sorry about that."

By Berles account, he continued to play child roles in other films: Bunnys Little Brother, Tess of the Storm Country (1914 film) Tess of the Storm Country, Birthright, Loves Penalty, Divorce Coupons and Ruth of the Range. Berle recalled, "There were even trips out to Hollywood—the studios paid—where I got parts in Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, with Mary Pickford; The Mark of Zorro (1920 film) The Mark of Zorro, with Douglas Fairbanks Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., and Tillies Punctured Romance (1914 film) Tillies Punctured Romance, with Charlie Chaplin, Mabel Normand and Marie Dressler."<ref name=Newcomb/> In 1916, Berle enrolled in the Professional Childrens School.<ref name=Newcomb>Newcomb, Horace. Editor, Encyclopedia of Television, vol. I, Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, (1997) pp. 163-165</ref>

==Career==
===Vaudeville===
Around 1920, at age 12, Berle made his stage debut in a revival of the musical comedy Florodora in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which later moved to Broadway theatre Broadway.  By the time he was 16, he was working as a Master of Ceremonies in Vaudeville.  By the early 1930s he was a successful stand-up comedian, patterning himself after one of Vaudevilles top comics, Ted Healy.

===Rising star===

In 1933, he was hired by producer Jack White (film producer) Jack White to star in the theatrical featurette Poppin the Cork, a topical musical comedy concerning the repealing of Prohibition. Berle also co-wrote the score for this film, which was released by Educational Pictures. Berle continued to dabble in songwriting. With Ben Oakland and Milton Drake, Berle wrote the title song for the RKO Radio Pictures release Lil Abner (1940), an adaptation of Al Capps comic strip, featuring Buster Keaton as Lonesome Polecat.<ref>[http://emol.org/movies/lilabner/movie256.html Entertainment Magazine: Astor Pictures, Lil Abner (1940)] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228075002/http://emol.org/movies/lilabner/movie256.html  date=2007-02-28 }}</ref> Berle wrote a Spike Jones B-side, "Leave the Dishes in the Sink, Ma."

===Radio===
From 1934–36, Berle was heard regularly on Rudy Vallee The Rudy Vallee Hour, and he attracted publicity as a regular on The Gillette Original Community Sing, a Sunday night comedy-variety program broadcast on CBS from September 6, 1936 to August 29, 1937. In 1939, he was the host of Stop Me If Youve Heard This One with panelists spontaneously finishing jokes sent in by listeners.<ref name="RadioArchives2011"/>

In the late 1940s, he canceled well-paying nightclub appearances to expand his radio career.<ref name="RadioArchives2011"/> Three Ring Time, a comedy-variety show sponsored by Ballantine Ale, was followed by a 1943 program sponsored by Campbell Soup Company Campbells Soups. The audience participation show Let Yourself Go (1944–1945) could best be described as "slapstick radio"{{citation needed date=April 2012}} with studio audience members acting out long suppressed urges—often directed at host Berle. Kiss and Make Up, on CBS in 1946, featured the problems of contestants decided by a jury from the studio audience with Berle as the judge. Berle also made guest appearances on many comedy-variety radio programs during the 1930s and 1940s.<ref name="RadioArchives2011">{{cite web url=http://www.radioarchives.com/Milton_Berle_Show_p/ra017.htm title=The Milton Berle Show publisher=RadioArchives accessdate=2 February 2011}}</ref>

Scripted by Hal Block and Martin Ragaway, The Milton Berle Show brought Berle together with Arnold Stang, later a familiar face as Berles TV sidekick. Others in the cast were Pert Kelton, Mary Schipp, Jack Albertson, Arthur Q. Bryan, Ed Begley, Brazilian singer Dick Farney, and announcer Frank Gallop. Sponsored by Philip Morris USA Philip Morris, it aired on NBC from March 11, 1947 until April 13, 1948.

Berle later described this series as "the best radio show I ever did ... a hell of a funny variety show". It served as a springboard for Berles emergence as televisions first major star.<ref name="RadioArchives2011"/>

===Mr. Television===
Berle first appeared on television in 1929 in an experimental broadcast in Chicago which he hosted in front of 129 people.<ref name="MBC">{{cite web url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/miltonberle.htm title=The Milton Berle Show publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>

Berle would revive the structure and routines of his vaudeville act for his debut on commercial TV, hosting The Texaco Star Theatre on June 8, 1948 over the NBC Television Network.<ref name="Epstein2002"/><ref name="Madigan2001"/><ref>Sackett, Susan (1993) p.1954 quotation: {{quote .  When the program premiered on Tuessday, June 8, 1948 on NBC Television, the format was strictly vaudeville, with dancers, jugglers, acrobats and guest stars in sketches--in short, a close approximation of the show that Berle was already doing for ABC on Wednesday nights.</ref>  They did not settle on Berle as the permanent host right away, but was originally part of a rotation of hosts (Berle himself had only a four-week contract). Comedian Jack Carter was host for August. Berle was named the permanent host that fall.

Berles highly visual style, characterized by vaudeville slapstick and outlandish costumes, proved ideal for the new medium.<ref name="Young2010p706">Young, William H. and Young, Nancy K. (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=YjbR9EXABPEC&pg=PA706 World War II and the Postwar Years in America: A Historical and Cultural Encyclopedia, Volume 1], p.706 quotation: {{quote Radio exists as an aural medium, and no matter how physically animated a performer may be or how clownish his or her costume ... Berles comedic gift shone in slapstick, something he had mastered in his vaudeville experiences. Many radio stars found it difficult to make the transition to TV ... Not so Berle. Radio had confined the comedian, making him reliant on his wealth of jokes and little else. ...

Berle dominated Tuesday night television for the next several years, reaching the number one slot in the Nielsen ratings with as much as an 80% share of the viewing audience. Berle and the show each won Emmy Awards after the first season. Fewer movie tickets were sold on Tuesdays. Some theaters, restaurants and other businesses shut down for the hour or closed for the evening so their customers would not miss Berles antics.<ref name="tvmuseum"/> Berles autobiography notes that in Detroit, "an investigation took place when the water levels took a drastic drop in the reservoirs on Tuesday nights between 9 and 9:05.

Television set sales more than doubled after Texaco Star Theatres debut, reaching two million in 1949. Berles stature as the mediums first superstar earned him the sobriquet "Mr. Television".<ref name="tvmuseum"/> He also earned another nickname after ending a 1949 broadcast with a brief ad-libbed remark to children watching the show: "Listen to your Uncle Miltie and go to bed."<ref>{{cite book title=Milton Berle: An Autobiography editor-last=Berle editor-first=Milton editor2-last=Frankel editor2-first=Haskel publisher=Delacorte Press year=1974 pages=337 isbn=0-440-05609-8 accessdate=}}</ref> Francis Craig and Kermit Goells Near You became the theme song that closed Berles TV shows.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.classicthemes.com/50sTVThemes/themePages/texacoStarTheater.html title=Texaco Star Theater / The Milton Berle Show work=classicthemes.com}}</ref>

Berle risked his newfound TV stardom at its zenith to challenge Texaco when the sponsor tried to prevent black performers from appearing on his show:

<blockquote>I remember clashing with the advertising agency and the sponsor over my signing the Four Step Brothers for an appearance on the show. The only thing I could figure out was that there was an objection to black performers on the show, but I couldnt even find out who was objecting. "We just dont like them," I was told, but who the hell was "we"? Because I was riding high in 1950, I sent out the word: "If they dont go on, I dont go on." At ten minutes of eight—ten minutes before showtime—I got permission for the Step Brothers to appear. If I broke the color-line policy or not, I dont know, but later on I had no trouble booking Bill Robinson or Lena Horne.<ref>Milton Berle, Haskel Frankel (1974)  [https://books.google.com/books?id=-0BaAAAAMAAJ Milton Berle: an autobiography, with Haskel Frankel] p.285</ref></blockquote>

Berles mother Sadie was often in the audience for his broadcasts; she had long served as a "plant" to encourage laughter from his stage show audiences.<ref name="childwonder"/> Her unique, "piercing, roof-shaking laugh"<ref name="childwonder"/><ref name=Ruth/> would stand out, especially when Berle made an entrance in an outrageous costume. After feigning surprise he would "ad lib" a response; for example: "Lady, youve got all night to make a fool of yourself. Ive only got an hour!"

Berle asked NBC to switch from live broadcasts to film, which would have made possible reruns (and residual income from them); he was angered when the network refused. However, NBC did consent to make a kinescope of each show. Later, Berle was offered 25% ownership of a company manufacturing the teleprompter by its inventor, Irving Berlin Kahn, if he would simply use the new gadget on his program. He turned the offer down.<ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SWcxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mwEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7291,3455107&dq=milton+berle+son&hl=en title=Berle Recalls Beginning of TV date=13 June 1968 author=Humphrey, Hal publisher=Toledo Blade accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref>

For Berles contribution to television, he was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.

===TV decline===
At one million dollars a year, NBC signed him to an exclusive, unprecedented 30-year television contract in 1951.

Texaco pulled out of sponsorship of the show in 1953. Buick picked it up, prompting a renaming to The Buick-Berle Show, and the programs format was changed to show the backstage preparations to put on a variety show. Critics generally approved of the changes, but Berles ratings continued to fall, and Buick pulled out after two seasons.<ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7ecKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CVADAAAAIBAJ&pg=2406,1249723&dq=milton+berle+son&hl=en title=Berle Traded For Gleason date=20 December 1954 publisher=Prescott Evening Courier accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref> In addition, "Berles persona had shifted from the impetuous and aggressive style of the Texaco Star Theater days to a more cultivated, but less distinctive personality, leaving many fans somehow unsatisfied."<ref name=Newcomb/>

By the time the again-renamed Milton Berle Show finished its only full season (1955&ndash;56), Berle was already becoming history—though his final season was host to two of Elvis Presleys earliest television appearances, April 3 and June 5, 1956.<ref>[http://www.elvispresleynews.com/MiltonBerle.html Milton Berle — Milton Berle Show<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123000046/http://www.elvispresleynews.com/MiltonBerle.html  date=2007-01-23 }}</ref> The final straw during that last season may have come from CBS scheduling The Phil Silvers Show opposite Berle. Ironically, Silvers was one of Berles best friends in show business and had come to CBSs attention in an appearance on Berles program. Bilkos creator-producer, Nat Hiken, had been one of Berles radio writers.

Berle knew that NBC had already decided to cancel his show before Presley appeared.<ref>The Blue Moon Boys — The Story of Elvis Presleys Band. Ken Burke and Dan Griffin. 2006.

===Life after The Milton Berle Show===
Image:Leavelaugh.jpg right
In Las Vegas, Berle played to packed showrooms at Caesars Palace, Sands Hotel the Sands, the Desert Inn, and other casino hotels. Berle had appeared at the Thunderbird (resort) El Rancho, one of the first Vegas hotels, in the late 1940s. In addition to constant club appearances, Berle performed on Broadway theatre Broadway in Herb Gardners The Goodbye People in 1968. He also became a commercial spokesman for the thriving Lums Lums restaurant chain.

He appeared in numerous films, including Always Leave Them Laughing (released in 1949, shortly after his TV debut) with Virginia Mayo and Bert Lahr, Lets Make Love with Marilyn Monroe and Yves Montand, Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, The Loved One, The Oscar (film) The Oscar, Whos Minding the Mint?, Lepke, Woody Allens Broadway Danny Rose and Driving Me Crazy.

Freed in part from the obligations of his NBC contract, Berle was signed in 1966 to a new, weekly variety series on American Broadcasting Company ABC. The show failed to capture a large audience and was cancelled after one season. He later appeared as guest villain List of Batman (TV series) episodes#Season 3 Louie the Lilac on ABCs Batman (TV series) Batman series. Other memorable guest appearances included stints on The Barbara Stanwyck Show, The Lucy Show, The Jackie Gleason Show, Get Smart, Laugh-In, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, The Hollywood Palace, Ironside (TV series) Ironside, F Troop, Fantasy Island, I Dream of Jeannie, CHiPs, The Muppet Show and The Jack Benny Program.

Like his contemporary Jackie Gleason, Berle proved a solid dramatic actor and was acclaimed for several such performances, most notably his lead role in "Doyle Against the House" on The Dick Powell Show in 1961, a role for which he received an Emmy Award Emmy nomination. He also played the part of a blind survivor of an airplane crash in Seven in Darkness, the first in ABCs popular ABC Movie of the Week Movie of the Week series. (He also played it straight as an agent in The Oscar (film) The Oscar (1966) and was one of the few actors in that infamous flop to get good notices from critics.)

During this period, Berle was named to the Guinness Book of World Records for the greatest number of charity performances made by a show-business performer. Unlike the high-profile shows done by Bob Hope to entertain the troops, Berle did more shows, over a period of 50 years, on a lower-profile basis. Berle received an award for entertaining at stateside military bases in World War I as a child performer, in addition to traveling to foreign bases during World War II and the Vietnam War. The first charity telethon (for the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation<ref>[http://www.damonrunyon.org] damonrunyon.org</ref>) was hosted by Berle in 1949.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000926/ title=Milton Berle work=IMDb}}</ref> A permanent fixture at charity benefits in the Hollywood area, he was instrumental in raising millions for charitable causes.

===Late career===
On April 14, 1979, Berle guest-hosted NBCs Saturday Night Live. Berles long reputation for taking control of an entire television production—whether invited to do so or not—was a cause of stress on the set. <!--In Tom Shales and James Andrew Millers Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live,--> One of the shows writers, Rosie Shuster, described the rehearsals for the Berle SNL show and the telecast as "watching a comedy train accident in slow motion on a loop." Upstaging, camera mugging, doing spit-takes, inserting old comedy bits, and climaxing the show with a maudlin performance of "September Song" complete with a pre-arranged standing ovation (something producer Lorne Michaels had never sanctioned) resulted in Berle being banned from hosting the show again. The episode was also barred from being rerun until surfacing in 2003, because Michaels thought it brought down the shows reputation.<ref>[http://www.zimbio.com/Infamous+moments+in+Saturday+Night+Live+history/notes/1 Infamous moments in Saturday Night Live history] {{Webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722084110/http://www.zimbio.com/Infamous+moments+in+Saturday+Night+Live+history/notes/1  date=2012-07-22 }} at zimbio.com, retrieved June 27, 2013.</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120917165422/http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/entertainment-bestworstsnl/11/ Best and Worst SNL Hosts] at xfinity.comcast.net, retrieved June 27, 2013.</ref>

As a guest star on The Muppet Show,<ref>{{cite book last1=Garlen first1=Jennifer C. last2=Graham first2=Anissa M. title=Kermit Culture: Critical Perspectives on Jim Hensons Muppets year=2009 publisher=McFarland & Company isbn=078644259X page=218}}</ref>  Berle was memorably upstaged by the heckling theatre critics Statler and Waldorf.<ref>{{YouTube PGfx3QAV64M Milton Berle Vs. Statler & Waldorf}}</ref>  The Statler and Waldorf puppets were inspired by a character named Sidney Spritzer, played by comedian Irving Benson, who regularly heckled Berle from a box seat during episodes of the 1960s ABC series.  Milton Berle also made a cameo appearance in The Muppet Movie as a used car dealer, taking Fozzie Bears 1951 Studebaker in trade for a station wagon.

In 1974, Berle had a minor altercation with younger actor/comedian Richard Pryor when both appeared as guests on The Mike Douglas Show. At the time, Berle was discussing the emotional fallout from an experience he had with impregnating a woman he was not married to, and having to decide whether or not they would keep the child. During his talk, Pryor let out a laugh, to which Berle took exception and confronted him, stating, "I wish, I wish, Richard, that I could have laughed at that time at your age, when I was your age, the way you just laughed now, but I just couldnt... I told you this nine years ago, and now Ill tell you on the air in front of millions of people: Pick your spots, baby." This prompted Pryor to mockingly quip back, "All right, sweetheart."<ref>{{cite web url=http://afflictor.com/2011/10/26/pick-your-spots-baby/ title=This website is currently unavailable. work=afflictor.com}}</ref>

File:Milton Berle at the 41st Emmys.jpg left thumb Berle at the 41st Primetime Emmy Awards in 1989
Another well-known incident of upstaging occurred during the 1982 Emmy Awards, when Berle and Martha Raye were the presenters of the Emmy for Outstanding Writing. Berle was reluctant to give up the microphone to the awards recipients, from Second City Television, and interrupted actor/writer Joe Flahertys acceptance speech several times. After Flaherty made a joke, Berle replied sarcastically "Thats funny!" However, Flahertys response of "Sorry, Uncle Miltie... go to sleep" flustered Berle.<ref name="emmy">{{cite web title=SCTV Wins 1982 Emmy For Outstanding Writing in a Variety or Music Program url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4HXCyfcD6M&feature=youtu.be&t=140 accessdate=18 March 2016}}</ref> SCTV later created a parody sketch of the incident, in which Flaherty beats up a Berle look-alike, shouting, "Youll never ruin another acceptance speech, Uncle Miltie!"

One of his most popular performances in his later years was guest starring in 1992 in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air as womanizing, wise-cracking patient Max Jakey. Most of his dialogue was improvised and he shocked the studio audience by mistakenly blurting out a curse word. He also appeared in an acclaimed and Emmy-nominated turn on Beverly Hills, 90210 as an aging comedian befriended by Steve Sanders (90210) Steve Sanders, who idolizes him, but is troubled by his bouts of senility due to Alzheimers disease. He also voiced the Prince of Darkness, the main antagonist in the Canadian animated television anthology special The Real Story of Au Clair De La Lune. He also appeared in 1995 as a guest star in an episode of The Nanny in the part of her lawyer and great uncle.

In 1984, Berle appeared in drag in the video for Round and Round (Ratt song) "Round and Round" by the 1980s metal band Ratt (his nephew Marshall Berle was then their manager). He also made a brief appearance in Ratts "Back For More" video as a motorcyclist.

In 1985, he appeared on NBCs Amazing Stories (television) Amazing Stories (created by Steven Spielberg) in an episode called "Fine Tuning". In this episode, friendly aliens from space receive TV signals from the Earth of the 1950s and travel to Hollywood in search of their idols, Lucille Ball, Jackie Gleason, The Three Stooges, Burns and Allen, and Milton Berle. (When he realizes the aliens are doing his old material, Uncle Miltie is thunderstruck: "Stealing from Berle? Is that even possible?") Speaking gibberish, Berle is the only person able to communicate directly with the aliens.

Berle was again on the receiving end of an onstage jibe at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards where RuPaul responded to Berles reference of having once worn dresses himself (during his old television days) with the quip that Berle now wore diapers. A surprised Berle replied by recycling a line he had delivered to Henny Youngman on his Hollywood Palace show in 1966: "Oh, were going to ad lib? Ill check my brain and well start even."

==Berle offstage==
In 1947, Milton Berle founded the Friars Club of Beverly Hills at the old Savoy Hotel on Sunset Boulevard. Other founding members included Jimmy Durante, George Jessel (actor) George Jessel, Robert Taylor (actor) Robert Taylor, and Bing Crosby. In 1961, the club moved to Beverly Hills. The Friars is a private show business club famous for its celebrity members and roast (comedy) roasts, where a member is mocked by his club friends in good fun.

Unlike many of his peers, Berles offstage lifestyle did not include drugs or drinking, but did include cigars, a "whos who" list of beautiful women, and a lifelong addiction to gambling, primarily horse racing. Some felt his obsession with "the ponies" was responsible for Berle never amassing the wealth or business success of others in his position.

Berle was famous within show business for the rumored human penis size size of his penis.<ref>{{cite book last=Murray first=Susan title="Lessons from Uncle Miltie: Ethnic Masculinity and Early Televisions Vaudeo Star", in Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s edited by Janet Thumin year=2002 publisher=I.B.Tauris location=New York isbn=978-1860646829 page=86 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjaYusbwlJEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book last=Misch first=David title=Funny: The Book – Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Comedy year=2012 publisher=Applause Theater & Cinema location=Milwaukee WI isbn=978-1557838292 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nJPGyQIvWgQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=penis&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book last=Freden first=Marc title=Really!?!: A Memoir and Observations From A Man Whos Lived Life Not Quite Famous Enough year=2010 publisher=Xlibris isbn=978-1450073660 page=154 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vscEiMgiUAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>{{Self-published inline certain=yes date=December 2017}}<ref>{{cite book last=Sacks first=Mike title=And Heres the Kicker: Conversations with 21 Top Humor Writers on their Craft year=2009 publisher=Writers Digest location=Cincinnati OH isbn=978-1582975054 page=107}}</ref><ref>{{cite book last=Ross first=Jeffrey title=I Only Roast the Ones I Love: Busting Balls Without Burning Bridges year=2009 publisher=Simon and Schuster location=New York isbn=978-1439102794 page=106 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iY5hp9uB7i4C&pg=PA106&dq=milton+berle+penis&hl=en&sa=X&ei=I1SzUoqJOubI2gXegYGAAQ&ved=0CFYQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=milton%20berle%20penis&f=false}}</ref>    Phil Silvers once told a story about standing next to Berle at a urinal, glancing down, and quipping, "Youd better feed that thing, or its liable to turn on you!"{{citation needed date=April 2013}} In the short story A Beautiful Child, Truman Capote wrote Marilyn Monroe as saying: "Christ!

Though he "worked clean" for his entire onstage and onscreen career, except for the infamous Friars Club private celebrity roasts, Berle was known offstage to have a colorful vocabulary and few limits on when it was used. He often criticized younger comedians like Lenny Bruce and George Carlin for their X-rated humor, and challenged them to be just as funny without the four-letter words.

Hundreds of younger comics, including several comedy superstars, were encouraged and guided by Berle. Despite some less than flattering stories told about Berle being difficult to work with, his son, Bill, maintains that Berle was a source of encouragement and technical assistance for many new comics. Berles son Bob backs up his brothers statement. He was present many times during Berles Las Vegas shows and television guest appearances. Milton aided Fred Travalena, Ruth Buzzi, John Ritter, Marla Gibbs, Lily Tomlin, Dick Shawn and Will Smith. At a taping of a Donny & Marie (1976 TV series) Donny & Marie show episode, for example, Donny Osmond Donny and Marie Osmond recited a scripted joke routine to a studio audience, to little response. The director asked for a retake, and the Osmonds repeated the act, word for word, to even less response. A third attempt, with no variation, proved dismal—until Milton Berle, off-camera, went into the audience, pantomiming funny faces and gestures. Ever the professional, Berle timed each gesture to coincide with an Osmond punchline, so the dialogue seemed to be getting the maximum laughs.{{citation needed date=March 2018}}

==Final role and death==

Berle guest-starred as Uncle Leo in the Kenan & Kel special "Two Heads Are Better than None", which premiered in 2000. This would be his last acting role.

In April 2001 Berle announced that a malignant tumor had been found in his colon, but he had declined surgery.<ref>{{cite web url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/News/04/25/berle.ill/index.html?related title=Breaking News, Daily News and Videos – CNN.com work=CNN}}</ref> Berles wife said the tumor was growing so slowly that it would take 10 to 12 years to affect him in any significant or life-threatening way. One year after the announcement, on March 27, 2002, Berle died in Los Angeles from colon cancer. He died on the same day as Dudley Moore and Billy Wilder.<ref name=wp>{{cite news  title=Milton Berle, Mr. Television, Dies at 93  url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A28744-2002Mar27?language=printer  quote=Milton Berle, 93, the old-time vaudeville comic who earned the nickname "Mr. Television" for introducing millions of Americans to the electronic medium during its infancy and thereby helping to change the country forever, died yesterday at his home in Los Angeles.
