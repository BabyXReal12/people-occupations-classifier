The piano teacher later decided to make a career change and become a childrens agent, since she knew people in the business through her daughters work. The teacher asked Shearers parents for permission to take him to an audition. Several months later, she called Shearers parents and told them that she had gotten Shearer an audition for the radio show The Jack Benny Program. Shearer received the role when he was seven years old.<ref name="ign1">{{cite web  title=Interview with Harry Shearer (Part 1 of 4)  url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035860p1.html  author=Plume, Kenneth  publisher=IGN  date=February 10, 2000  accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref> He described Jack Benny as "very warm and approachable [...] He was a guy who dug the idea of other people on the show getting laughs, which sort of spoiled me for other people in comedy."<ref name="avclub"/> Shearer said in an interview that one person who "took him under his wing" and was one of his best friends during his early days in show business was voice actor Mel Blanc, who voiced many animated characters, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Barney Rubble.<ref name="sfgate">{{cite news  url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=5&entry_id=11888  title=Chronicle Podcasts : New Orleans economy stillborn, says Harry Shearer  date=August 25, 2007  accessdate=2009-04-30  work=San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> Shearer made his film debut in the 1953 film Abbott and Costello Go to Mars, in which he had a small part.

After the filming, Shearers parents said they did not want him to be a regular in a series. Instead they wanted him to just do occasional work so that he could have a normal childhood. Shearer and his parents made the decision not to accept the role in the series if it was picked up by a television network.<ref name="avclub"/>

Shearer attended University of California, Los Angeles UCLA as a political science major in the early 1960s and decided to quit show business to become a "serious person".<ref name="ign1"/> However, he says this lasted approximately a month, and he joined the staff of the Daily Bruin, UCLAs school newspaper, during his first year.<ref name="ign1"/> He was editor of the college humor magazine (Satyr) including the June 1964 parody, Preyboy <ref>Preyboy</ref> He also worked as a newscaster at KRLA, a top 40 radio station in Pasadena, during this period.  According to Shearer, after graduating, he had "a very serious agenda going on, and it was Stay Out of the Draft."<ref name="ign1"/> He attended graduate school at Harvard University for one year and worked at the state legislature in Sacramento. In 1967 and 1968, he was a high school teacher, teaching English and social studies. He left teaching following "disagreements with the administration."<ref name="ign1"/>

From 1969 to 1976, Shearer was a member of The Credibility Gap, a radio comedy group that included David Lander, Richard Beebe and Michael McKean.<ref>{{cite web  url={{Allmusic  class=artist  id=p149  pure_url=yes}}  title=The Credibility Gap  accessdate=2008-01-02  author=Deming, Mark  publisher=AllMusic}}</ref> The group consisted of "a bunch of newsmen" at KRLA 1110, "the number two station" in Los Angeles.<ref name="avclub"/> They wanted to do more than just straight news, so they hired comedians who were talented vocalists. Shearer heard about it from a friend so he brought over a tape to the station and nervously gave it to the receptionist. He found out he was hired that same day. The groups radio show was canceled in 1970 by KRLA and in 1971 by KPPC-FM, so they started performing in various clubs and concert venues.<ref name="ign1"/> While at KRLA, Shearer also interviewed Creedence Clearwater Revival for the Pop Chronicles music documentary.<ref name="Gilliland">{{cite web  url=http://www.library.unt.edu/music/special-collections/john-gilliland/e-l  title=Index to Interviews  work=Pop Chronicles  accessdate=2008-01-02  authorlink=John Gilliland  last=Gilliland  first=John}}</ref> In 1973, Shearer appeared as Jim Houseafire on How Time Flys, an album by The Firesign Theatres David Ossman.

==Career==

===Saturday Night Live===
In August 1979, Shearer was hired as a writer and cast member on Saturday Night Live, one of the first additions to the cast,<ref name="avclub"/> and an unofficial replacement for John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, who were both leaving the show.<ref name="ign2">{{cite web  title=Interview with Harry Shearer (Part 2 of 4)  url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/035/035861p1.html  author=Plume, Kenneth  publisher=IGN  date=February 10, 2000  accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref> Al Franken recommended Shearer to Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels.<ref>{{harvnb Shales Miller 2002  p=170}}</ref> Shearer describes his experience on the show as a "living hell" and "not a real pleasant place to work."<ref name="ign2"/> He did not get along well with the other writers and cast members and states that he was not included with the cast in the opening montage (although he was added to the montage for latter episodes of the 1979–80 season) and that Lorne Michaels had told the rest of the cast that he was just a writer.<ref>{{harvnb Shales Miller 2002  p=171}}</ref> Michaels left Saturday Night Live at the end of the fifth season, taking the entire cast with him.<ref>{{harvnb Shales Miller 2002  p=176}}</ref> Shearer told new executive producer Jean Doumanian that he was "not a fan of Lornes" and offered to stay with the show if he was given the chance to overhaul the program and bring in experienced comedians, like Christopher Guest. However, Doumanian turned him down, so he decided to leave with the rest of the cast.<ref>{{harvnb Shales Miller 2002  p=210}}</ref>

In 1984, while promoting the film This Is Spinal Tap, Shearer, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean performed on Saturday Night Live. All three members were offered the chance to join the show in the 1984–1985 season. Shearer accepted because he was treated well by the producers and he thought the backstage environment had improved<ref name="ign2"/> but later stated that he "didnt realize that guests are treated better than the regulars."<ref>{{harvnb Shales Miller 2002  p=261}}</ref> Guest also accepted the offer while McKean rejected it, although he would join the cast in 1994. Dick Ebersol, who replaced Lorne Michaels as the shows producer, said that Shearer was "a gifted performer but a pain in the butt.

Hes just a nightmare-to-deal-with person."<ref>{{harvnb Shales Miller 2002  p=260}}</ref> In January 1985, Shearer left the show for good,<ref name="ign2"/> partially because he felt he was not being used enough.<ref name="Shales287">{{harvnb Shales Miller 2002  p=287}}</ref> Martin Short said Shearer "wanted to be creative and Dick [Ebersol] wanted something else.

===Spinal Tap===
Shearer co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in Rob Reiners 1984 film This Is Spinal Tap.<ref name="avclub"/> Shearer, Reiner, Michael McKean and Christopher Guest received a deal to write a first draft of a screenplay for a company called Marble Arch. They decided that the film could not be written and instead filmed a 20-minute demo of what they wanted to do.<ref name="ign2"/> It was eventually greenlighted by Norman Lear and Jerry Perenchio at Embassy Pictures.<ref name="ign2"/> The film satirizes the wild personal behavior and musical pretensions of hard rock and Heavy metal music heavy metal bands, as well as the hagiography hagiographic tendencies of rockumentary rockumentaries of the time. The three core members of the band Spinal Tap (band) Spinal Tap—David St. Hubbins, Derek Smalls and Nigel Tufnel—were portrayed by McKean, Shearer and Guest respectively. The three actors play their musical instruments and speak with mock English accents throughout the film. There was no script, although there was a written breakdown of most of the scenes, and many of the lines were ad-libbed.<ref name="ign2"/> It was filmed in 25 days.<ref name="ign2"/>

Shearer said in an interview that "The animating impulse was to do rock n roll right. The four of us had been around rock n roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, but we wanted to get it right."<ref name="thejc"/> When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, "No, this is a story thats pretty familiar to people. Were not introducing them to anything they dont really know," so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public.<ref name="avclub"/> The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and a cult following, after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the American Film Institutes AFIs 100 Years... 100 Laughs list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/laughs.aspx  title=AFIs 100 Years... 100 Laughs  date=June 14, 2000  publisher=American Film Institute  accessdate=2009-04-30  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615021804/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/laughs.aspx  archivedate=June 15, 2008}}</ref> and it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.loc.gov/film/titles.html  title=Films Selected to The National Film Registry, Library of Congress 1989–2008  publisher=Library of Congress  year=2009  accessdate=2009-04-30}}</ref>

Shearer is also known for his prolific work as a voice actor on The Simpsons.

The episode has been criticized by both Shearer and Groening. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, "Thats so wrong.
