Cliff Nazarro (January 31, 1904 â€“ February 18, 1961) was a popular double-talk comedian of the 1930s and 1940s who appeared in movies such as Youll Never Get Rich (1941) as Swivel Tongue with Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth, In Old Colorado (1941) as Nosey Haskins with William Boyd (actor) William Boyd, and Hillbilly Blitzkrieg (1942) as Barney Google and Snuffy Smith Barney Google.
A comment in a 1942 newspaper article summed up Nazarros varied talents: "He played all sorts of roles in stock companies, was a versatile actor in musical comedy and vaudeville, is one of the top masters-of-ceremony in show business, and was a serious vocalist on the radio."
Nazarro was the voice of Warner Brothers cartoon character "Egghead." He made a few commercial recordings, including a 1932 date as vocalist with Swing music swing band Roanes Pennsylvanians and a 1942 comic recitation, "News of the World."
