He graduated in 1977 from Notre Dame High School (Harper Woods, Michigan) Notre Dame High School in Harper Woods, Michigan, where he was a member of the varsity ice hockey team, playing defense alongside future NHL player John Blum. He briefly attended the University of Michigan but dropped out after his freshman year to pursue comedy.{{citation needed date=October 2015}}

==Career==
Coulier met future Full House co-star Bob Saget through the Los Angeles comedy circuit. The two became good friends and Coulier briefly lived with Saget and his then-wife Sherri on their couch in the early 1980s as he struggled to get his career started.

He was initially cast as a player for Saturday Night Live for the 1986 season. However, right before the season started, casting changes were made and he was left off the show. It was said that many of the producers felt he was too similar in humor style to Dana Carvey, who was also joining the show in 1986, and that was why the change was made.

Coulier has done extensive voice work for shows including Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series) Scooby and Scrappy-Doo, The Real Ghostbusters, Slimer! and the Real Ghostbusters (taking over the character of Peter Venkman after Lorenzo Musics departure from the role), Extreme Ghostbusters, Muppet Babies after Howie Mandel left (Baby Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem#Animal Animal, Baby Bunsen Honeydew Bunsen, Bean Bunny, and Uncle Statler and Waldorf, and a pre-teen Janice (muppet) Janice for one episode), The Jetsons, Rude Dog Rude Dog and the Dweebs, and Detention (TV series) Detention. From 1984 to 1985, he was also the host of a comedy series on Nickelodeon known as Out of Control (TV series) Out of Control.

Coulier is known for playing Joey Gladstone on the American Broadcasting Company ABC sitcom Full House.<ref>{{cite news url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/postcrescent/access/1876067551.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+07%2C+2009&author=Cheryl+Anderson&pub=The+Post+-+Crescent&desc=Standup+comedian+Dave+Coulier+best+known+as+Uncle+Joey+on+ABCs+%22Full+House%22+brings+comic+act+to+Comedy+Quarter+in+Neenah&pqatl=google archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724231000/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/postcrescent/access/1876067551.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+07%2C+2009&author=Cheryl+Anderson&pub=The+Post+-+Crescent&desc=Standup+comedian+Dave+Coulier+best+known+as+Uncle+Joey+on+ABCs+%22Full+House%22+brings+comic+act+to+Comedy+Quarter+in+Neenah&pqatl=google dead-url=yes archive-date=July 24, 2012 title=Coulier on ABCs Full House publisher=pqasb.pqarchiver.com accessdate=December 2, 2010 first=Cheryl last=Anderson date=October 7, 2009}}</ref> He stayed on the show from 1987 until its cancellation in 1995. He was famous for doing voices and impersonations. In addition to Full House, Coulier appeared on George and Leo and Nick Freno: Licensed Teacher. He has also hosted Americas Funniest People (first with Arleen Sorkin and later with Tawny Kitaen) and Opportunity Knocks. Additionally, he was also a voice actor in Yogi Bear and the Magical Flight of the Spruce Goose and has voiced Felix the Cat on a few occasions. He also put out a solo album called Cut It Out, a self-proclaimed tribute to "Sleeveless shirt tank tops and short shorts."

In addition to his voice work, Coulier has also taken a few acting parts appearing in the Disney Channel Original Movies The Thirteenth Year and The Even Stevens Movie (where he had a Cameo appearance cameo as a reality show host), as well as the Nickelodeon original movie Shredderman Rules and he wrote and starred in an unaired pilot for FX called Whispers and Balls.

He also founded his own childrens entertainment company F3 Entertainment, in 2000. In 2003, Coulier appeared on season three of The Surreal Life. In 2006, he appeared on the TV reality show Skating with Celebrities on Fox Broadcasting Company FOX, where he was paired with Olympic medalist Nancy Kerrigan. They were eliminated in episode four.

Currently, he is a member of Ducks Breath Mystery Theater touring comedy troupe (which he claims is clean comedy but "not quite as creepy" as Full House) as well as host of the series Animal Kidding. His work on Robot Chicken is probably his most "adult" to date, voicing off-color situations, like Popeye savagely beating J. Wellington Wimpy Wimpy over a debt.

On June 2, 2008, Chikara (professional wrestling) Chikara, professional wrestling promotion based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, announced that Coulier was elected by the Chikara Board of Directors as the new commissioner of the company, a position that he held for two years until the next election (which took place on May 25, 2010). Coulier is the successor to former Commissioner and fellow Full House cast member Bob Saget.

In 2009, Coulier provided the voice for Bob McKenzie on the Television in Canada Canadian animated series Bob & Doug (2009 TV series) Bob & Doug, based on the Second City Television SCTV characters Bob and Doug McKenzie. Coulier became the first person other than Rick Moranis to portray the character, as Moranis (who serves as executive producer) was not interested in resuming the part. Coulier says he understands that longtime fans might be skeptical of his take on the role, but he could not help jumping at the chance to portray one of his favorite comic characters. "Its huge shoes to fill, stepping into Rick Moranis shoes. Its such an established, great character and I guess the only thing I have going for me is that it kind of sounds alike and that half of my family is from Canada." His mothers family is from Bathurst, New Brunswick.<ref>{{cite web url=http://beta.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=Entertainment&ArticleID=news/capfeed/entertainment/e041659A.xml  title=TELUS, news, headlines, stories, breaking, entertainment, music, movies  publisher=Beta.mytelus.com  accessdate=June 3, 2010 }}{{dead link date=December 2016  bot=InternetArchiveBot  fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Coulier continued to make regular television appearances as the host of shows such as Americas Funniest People and Americas Most Talented Kid. He continues to tour the U.S. and Canada as a stand-up comedian.

===Comedic style===
{{BLP unsourced section date=October 2014}}
Couliers stand-up routine is centered on his ability to mimic celebrities and cartoon characters, a talent that has given him a second career in voice acting. Many of Couliers bits involve putting well-known characters into unexpected situations. Coulier has also been known to include harmonica playing in his act. Couliers material is largely family-friendly, a position he has extended to his youth-oriented comedy website, cleanguys.TV.

In April 2008, Coulier was featured on the Clean Guys of Comedy Tour, a family-friendly comedy group. The tour includes Ryan Hamilton (comedian) Ryan Hamilton from Last Comic Standing and Kivi Rogers.
