He performed in a number of Broadway theatre Broadway musical theater musicals, including Hallelujah, Baby! and Aint Supposed to Die a Natural Death. In 1965, he worked alongside Amiri Baraka, Sun Ra, Albert Ayler and Sonia Sanchez at the Black Arts Movement Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School in Harlem; during this period, the theater was frequently raided and surveilled by the New York City Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<ref>{{cite web url=https://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/my-snl-testimonials-from-cast-members-who-lived-it/?print=1 title=My ‘SNL’: Testimonials From Cast Members Who Lived It first=Matt last=Patches date=21 August 2014 website=Grantland.com accessdate=17 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://omeka.wustl.edu/omeka/exhibits/show/fbeyes/theatreschool title=Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School · F.B.

==Saturday Night Live==
Morris has appeared in numerous television shows and movies since the early 1970s, but is best known as one of the original cast members of NBCs Saturday Night Live. Periodically on SNL he sang classical music: once a Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Mozart aria when guest-host Walter Matthau designated him as a "musical guest...in place of the usual crap", and once a Franz Schubert Schubert lied while the titles on the screen purported to express his colleagues displeasure at having to accommodate a misguided request by him. In February 1977, he sang Tchaikovskys None but the Lonely Heart (Tchaikovsky) Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt barefoot in colorful Caribbean dress while subtitles explained he had just returned from Jamaica where he had picked up a girl by claiming to be Harry Belafonte.

One of Morriss best known characters on SNL was the Dominican baseball player Chico Escuela. Chico spoke only limited and halting English, so the joke centered on his responding to almost any question with his catch phrase: "Baseball... been berra berra good... to me." Another recurring bit, used in the newscast segment "Weekend Update", involved Morris being presented as "President of the New York School for the hard of hearing Hard of Hearing" and assisting the newscaster by shouting the main headlines, in a parody of the then-common practice of providing sign language interpretation in an inset on the screen as an aid to the deaf viewer. According to the book Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live, Morris was frequently unhappy during his tenure on SNL from 1975–1980, and expressed the opinion that he was usually Typecasting (acting) typecast in stereotypical roles.<ref name=Backstage/>

African-American performers who have followed Morris on Saturday Night Live have at times been publicly concerned with experiencing the same fate Morris did. Eddie Murphy, for example, told TV Guide in the early 1980s that SNL producer Jean Doumanian "had tried to Garrett Morris me."      <ref name=Backstage>Hill and Weingrad, Hill, Doug, and Jeff Weingrad.
