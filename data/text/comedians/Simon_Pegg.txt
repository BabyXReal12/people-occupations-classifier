In 1999, he created and co-wrote the Channel 4 sitcom Spaced with Jessica Hynes Jessica Stevenson. The series was directed by Edgar Wright, with whom Pegg and Stevenson had previously worked on Asylum, and Pegg wrote the character of Mike Watt specifically for his friend Nick Frost.
For his performance in this series, Pegg was nominated for a British Comedy Awards British Comedy Award as Best Male Comedy Newcomer.
The experience of making a Spaced fantasy sequence featuring zombie (fictional) zombies led to Pegg and Wright co-writing the "romantic zombie comedy" film Shaun of the Dead, released in April 2004, in which Pegg also starred.
At George A. Romeros invitation, Pegg and Wright made cameo appearances in Romeros zombie film, Land of the Dead.
In 2004, Pegg starred in a spin-off of the television show Danger! 50,000 Volts! called Danger! 50,000 Zombies!, in which he played a zombie hunter named Dr. Fell.

He played mutant bounty hunter Johnny Alpha, the Strontium Dog, in a series of Big Finish Productions radio drama audio plays based on the character from British comic 2000 AD (comics) 2000 AD. Pegg also appeared in Big Finish Productions Doctor Who audio story Invaders from Mars (Doctor Who audio) Invaders From Mars as Don Chaney, and appeared in the Doctor Who television series, playing List of Doctor Who villains#Editor the Editor in the 2005 episode "The Long Game".
He also narrated the first series of the "making-of" documentary series Doctor Who Confidential.
Upon completion of Shaun of the Dead, Pegg was questioned as to whether he would be abandoning the British film industry for Hollywood, and he replied, "Its not like were going to go away and do, I dont know, Mission: Impossible III", picking the title of an imaginary Blockbuster (entertainment) blockbuster. When the film Mission: Impossible III was subsequently made, Pegg appeared in it as Benji Dunn, an Impossible Missions Force IMF technician who assists Tom Cruises character Ethan Hunt.
He reprised the role in the sequel films Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011),
Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015), and Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018).

In 2006, he played Gus in Big Nothing alongside David Schwimmer.
The same year, Pegg and Wright completed their second film, Hot Fuzz, released in February 2007. The film is a police-action movie homage and also stars Nick Frost, in which Pegg plays Nicholas Angel, a London policeman transferred to rural Sandford, a fictional village where grisly events take place.
In 2007, Pegg starred in The Good Night (directed by Jake Paltrow) and Run Fatboy Run directed by David Schwimmer and co-starring Thandie Newton and Hank Azaria. In 2008, he wrote the dialogue for an English language re-release of the cult 2006 animated Norwegian film, Free Jimmy. Pegg received screenwriting credit for this, and Pegg also voiced one of the main characters in the English-language version, which has an international range of actors including Woody Harrelson.

Pegg co-wrote the script for a film called Paul (film) Paul, about two young men who encounter a comedic extraterrestrial alien during a road trip across the US.
The completed script appeared on the 2008 "Brit List", a film-industry-compiled survey of the best unproduced British screenplays, inspired by the American Black List (survey) Black List.
In those films and in Spaced, Pegg typically plays the leading hero while Frost plays the sidekick. However Paul reverses this dynamic.
The film was later produced, and was released in 2011.

Pegg played engineer Montgomery Scott Montgomery "Scotty" Scott in Star Trek (film) Star Trek, the eleventh film in the Star Trek (film franchise) Star Trek film series,
released 8 May 2009. He reprised the role in the 2013 film Star Trek Into Darkness and Star Trek Beyond (2016), also co-writing the latter.
In 2010 he appeared as Burke and Hare William Burke in Burke and Hare (2010 film) Burke and Hare, a film directed by John Landis about two Ulstermen who were notorious murderers and bodysnatchers in early 19th-century Edinburgh. His likeness was also used for the character of Wee Hughie in the comic book series The Boys (comic book) The Boys; while this was done without Peggs permission, he quickly became a fan of the title, and even wrote the introduction to the first bound volume.
He voiced Reepicheep, the heroic mouse in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader.
Pegg and Wright completed the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy (the first two films being Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz) with their 2013 film The Worlds End (film) The Worlds End.

==Personal life==
Pegg is an Atheism atheist.
He married his long-time girlfriend Maureen McCann, a music industry publicist, on 23 July 2005 in Glasgow.
Best friend Nick Frost was the best man at his wedding.
The couple have one child together, Matilda (born 2009).
Pegg is close friends with Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin: Pegg appears as a violin-playing Elvis Presley Elvis impersonator in Coldplays 2010 single "Christmas Lights (song) Christmas Lights".
Along with Jonny Buckland, Pegg is godfather to Apple, daughter of Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow.
In return, Martin is godfather to Peggs daughter.
Pegg is also godfather to Joe, the son of actor and friend Martin Freeman.
Peggs parents and sister briefly appeared in Spaced, while his mother appeared in both Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.

In a July 2018 interview with The Guardian, Pegg opened up about his battle with Major depressive disorder depression and alcoholism, and how Rehabilitation counseling rehabilitation helped him recover from the latter. He stated: "When I watch [Mission: Impossible III], I can see where I was then, which was fairly lost, and unhappy, and an alcoholic [...] I’m not ashamed of what happened. And I think if anyone finds any relationship to it, then it might motivate them to get well. But I am not proud of it either — I don’t think it’s cool, like I was Mr. Rock ’n’ Roll, blackout and all that s---. It wasn’t, it was just terrible."
