==Early years==
Amstell was born in Gants Hill, London Borough of Redbridge Redbridge, east London in 1979, to David and Tina (née Leventhal) Amstell. He was brought up in a Judaism Jewish family, and he was the eldest of four children. He was educated at Beal High School,
a state comprehensive school in Ilford. His parents divorce in the early 1990s has been a constant theme throughout his stand-up career, and he says that their decision when he was born to circumcise him had caused him a sense of great emotional as well as physical loss.
==Life and career==
Amstells first television appearance was in 1993 when he appeared as a contestant on the Channel 4 game show GamesMaster.
In 1994 he appeared on Good Morning with Anne and Nick performing an impression of Dame Edna Everage.

Amstell started performing on the comedy circuit when he was in his early teens and later became the youngest finalist to appear in the BBC New Comedy Awards. His first professional television appearance was in 1998 as a presenter on the UK childrens channel Nickelodeon UK Nickelodeon. He claims he was sacked for being "sarcastic and mean to children"
although the posted biography on his website also, in jest, claims:
<blockquote>
 "He started his TV career at Nickelodeon where he was fired for making pop stars uncomfortable. He then began presenting the Channel 4 show, Popworld – where he gained a huge following for his groundbreaking work in making pop stars uncomfortable."
</blockquote>
===Popworld===
From 2000 to 2006, Amstell presented Popworld on Channel 4 with Miquita Oliver. He voiced the characters "Timothy the Popworld melon" and "Richard the Popworld horse" and developed a highly ironic, surreal and Out of left field left-field style which gained the show a cult following but angered many of its guests. One example was a mock interview with singer Lemar called "Lemar From Afar" in which Amstell shouted questions into a megaphone from one end of the worlds largest car park while Lemar stood at the other end. Another was a "Si-chiatrist" interview with Luke Pritchard and Hugh Harris (guitarist) Hugh Harris of The Kooks in which Amstell played the role of psychiatrist and Pritchard and Harris his patients.
===Never Mind the Buzzcocks===
Amstell first appeared on the comedy show Never Mind the Buzzcocks as a guest during Mark Lamarrs tenure as host, in 2003 and 2006. Following Lamarrs departure, he was one of the series guest hosts before being appointed as permanent host beginning in October 2006. He said at the time that he hoped to beat "the universal, exceptionless rule that when a new host takes over an old show it is a horrible, embarrassing disaster".
In June 2007, Amstell and long-term collaborator Dan Swimer wrote Imagine... A Mildly Amusing Panel Show, a spoof version of Alan Yentobs arts programme Imagine (TV series) Imagine.  Yentob and Amstell play themselves in a mock interview between what a number of commentators described as "overtly sexual"{{citation needed date=May 2012}} clips taken from Amstells Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes. It was followed in February 2008 by Never Mind the Buzzcocks: A Moving Tribute, which jokingly implied that Amstell had either died or retired from the show.

On 25 April 2009, Amstell announced via his internet mailing list that he would not be hosting another series of Never Mind the Buzzcocks because of his desire to concentrate on his live tours and stand-up performances.
