Amstell started performing on the comedy circuit when he was in his early teens and later became the youngest finalist to appear in the BBC New Comedy Awards. His first professional television appearance was in 1998 as a presenter on the UK childrens channel Nickelodeon UK Nickelodeon. He claims he was sacked for being "sarcastic and mean to children"<ref name=guardian2>{{cite news  url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1835165,00.html  title=I always want the funny line (interview)  work=The Guardian  date=2 August 2006  accessdate=4 June 2007  location=London  first=Dorian  last=Lynskey}}</ref> although the posted biography on his website also, in jest, claims:
<blockquote>"He started his TV career at Nickelodeon where he was fired for making pop stars uncomfortable. He then began presenting the Channel 4 show, Popworld&nbsp;– where he gained a huge following for his groundbreaking work in making pop stars uncomfortable."<ref>[http://www.simonamstell.co.uk/who.php ] {{webarchive  url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215025507/http://www.simonamstell.co.uk/who.php  date=15 February 2010 }}</ref></blockquote>

===Popworld===
From 2000 to 2006, Amstell presented Popworld on Channel 4 with Miquita Oliver. He voiced the characters "Timothy the Popworld melon" and "Richard the Popworld horse" and developed a highly ironic, surreal and Out of left field left-field style which gained the show a cult following but angered many of its guests. One example was a mock interview with singer Lemar called "Lemar From Afar" in which Amstell shouted questions into a megaphone from one end of the worlds largest car park while Lemar stood at the other end. Another was a "Si-chiatrist" interview with Luke Pritchard and Hugh Harris (guitarist) Hugh Harris of The Kooks in which Amstell played the role of psychiatrist and Pritchard and Harris his patients.<ref>q:Never Mind the Buzzcocks#18x02 List of Buzzcocks quotes, Series 18, Episode 2, Quote 2.</ref>

===Never Mind the Buzzcocks===
Amstell first appeared on the comedy show Never Mind the Buzzcocks as a guest during Mark Lamarrs tenure as host, in 2003 and 2006. Following Lamarrs departure, he was one of the series guest hosts before being appointed as permanent host beginning in October 2006. He said at the time that he hoped to beat "the universal, exceptionless rule that when a new host takes over an old show it is a horrible, embarrassing disaster".<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/08_august/23/buzzcocks.shtml  title=Press Office - Simon Amstell is new host of Never Mind the Buzzcocks Buzzcocks  publisher=BBC  date=23 August 2006  accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>

In June 2007, Amstell and long-term collaborator Dan Swimer wrote Imagine... A Mildly Amusing Panel Show, a spoof version of Alan Yentobs arts programme Imagine (TV series) Imagine.  Yentob and Amstell play themselves in a mock interview between what a number of commentators described as "overtly sexual"{{citation needed date=May 2012}} clips taken from Amstells Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes. It was followed in February 2008 by Never Mind the Buzzcocks: A Moving Tribute, which jokingly implied that Amstell had either died or retired from the show.

On 25 April 2009, Amstell announced via his internet mailing list that he would not be hosting another series of Never Mind the Buzzcocks because of his desire to concentrate on his live tours and stand-up performances.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/04/25/8788/amstell_quits_buzzcocks  title=Amstell quits Buzzcocks  publisher=Chortle.co.uk  date=25 April 2009  accessdate=25 April 2009}}</ref>
