Victoria Ann "Vicki" Lawrence (born March 26, 1949), sometimes credited as Vicki Lawrence Schultz, is an American actress, comedian, and pop music singing singer known for the many characters she originated on CBSs The Carol Burnett Show, where she appeared from 1967-78, for the entire series run.  One such character was "The Family (sketch) The Family" matriarch Thelma Harper Thelma Harper/Mama, the cold, unaffectionate mother of the neurotic, misfortunate, bedraggled Eunice Harper Eunice (Burnett) although Lawrence is 16 years younger than Burnett. Thelma Harper was the central character of the television situation comedy series  Mamas Family on NBC and, later, in first-run syndication.

In 1973, she became a one-hit wonder on the Billboard Hot 100 U.S. chart with "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia". It reached number one on both the United States and Canada top charts. Lawrence has multiple Emmy Award nominations, winning one in 1976.
She is also a multiple Golden Globe Award Golden Globe nominee, all for The Carol Burnett Show. Lawrence has made numerous post-Mamas Family guest TV show appearances in her famed Thelma Harper/Mama role. 

On February 5, 2013, Lawrence appeared as the character in a special sketch for Betty Whites 2nd Annual 90th Birthday.
In addition, she regularly hosts an untelevised stage show, titled Vicki Lawrence &amp; Mama: A Two-Woman Show.

==Early life==
Lawrence was born Victoria Ann Axelrad in Inglewood, California,
the daughter of Anne Alene (née Loyd) and Howard Axelrad, a certified public accountant for Max Factor.
The family surname was legally changed to "Lawrence" when Vicki was young.
She is a graduate of Morningside High School in Inglewood, class of 1967. Lawrence had originally planned on being a dental hygienist. She attended UCLA while on The Carol Burnett Show, and  changed her major to theater arts, but dropped out after two years.
In high school, she auditioned for and got into the musical group The Young Americans. She stayed with the group almost until the end of high school. By being with the group, she gained experience from touring, performing at the Academy Awards Oscars, coming in contact with noteworthy performers such as Johnny Mathis and Louis Armstrong, and performing on The Andy Williams Show.
In her senior year, she entered the Miss Fireball of Inglewood contest for the local firefighters ball. A reporter for a local newspaper wrote a story about the contest and stated that Lawrence bore a striking resemblance to a young Carol Burnett. An avid fan letter-writer, Lawrences mother urged her to write a letter, which Lawrence did, including the newspaper article. 

After receiving the letter, Burnett found Lawrences fathers name in the phone book, called her, and said she would go to see the Miss Fireball contest. Lawrence won the contest and Burnett was called to the stage to crown her. Coincidentally, Burnett was looking for an actress to play her younger sister on Carol Burnett Show her upcoming show. After a few months and auditions, Lawrence got the part, specifically for playing Chrissy in the "Carol and Sis" sketches.
After Lawrence was given the job on The Carol Burnett Show, both Burnett and Harvey Korman took her under their wings. Korman taught her various sketch comedy skills, such as listening not just for a cue line, and also coached her in other areas, such as speaking in different accents. Lawrence has credited Korman and Burnett with being her mentors, and has referred to her experience on the show as the "Harvard school of comedy". Lawrence has stated that she learned show business from Burnett and looked up to her very much, and that the two share a very close friendship.

As a comedian and actress, Lawrence is known for her work on The Carol Burnett Show, of which she was a part from 1967 to 1978. She was the only cast member, except for Burnett herself, who stayed on the show for the entire 11 seasons. After The Carol Burnett Show ended in 1978, Lawrence and her husband Al Schultz moved with their children to Maui, Hawaii, but after a few years, returned to Los Angeles, where they have remained.

Her portrayal of the Mama character on The Carol Burnett Shows "The Family" sketches was so popular that NBC subsequently created the sitcom Mamas Family, elaborating on the Mama character. (Burnett reprised the Eunice Higgins character for the sitcom from time to time.) The series ran from 1983 to 1985 on NBC; after its cancellation from NBC, it was renewed from 1986 to 1990 in first-run syndication. The show was more successful in the renewed version. She also reprised the Mama character on stage for Vicki Lawrence &amp; Mama: A Two-Woman Show.

Lawrence has made appearances on other programs, such as the sitcoms Laverne &amp; Shirley, Major Dad, Roseanne (TV series) Roseanne, Hannah Montana, and Yes, Dear. Between the NBC and syndication runs of Mamas Family, Lawrence starred in the 1985 comedy pilot Anything for Love, which aired as a special on CBS that summer and co-starred Lauren Tewes and Rebeca Arthur. Lawrence has also appeared with Burnett, Korman, and Tim Conway in the Burnett show retrospectives that were broadcast in 1993, 2001, and 2004. Lawrence played Sister Mary Paul (Sister Amnesia) in the TV special based on Nunsense Jamboree that originally aired on TNN in 1998.

Lawrence played Mamaw Stewart (the mother of Robby Ray Stewart and grandmother of Jackson Stewart (character) Jackson and Miley Stewart) in the hit Disney series Hannah Montana alongside Billy Ray Cyrus and his daughter Miley Cyrus.

Lawrence recently played as Mama in an Ohio commercial, promoting a constitutional amendment that would permit casino gambling in Ohio. Lawrence played Dans old high-school flame, Phyllis, in an episode of Roseanne. She also appeared in a special celebrity-edition episode of the Anne Robinson version of Weakest Link (U.S. game show) The Weakest Link. Playing for a charity, she made it to the final two, but ended up losing to Ed Begley, Jr.

===Music===
As a singer, Lawrence got her start as one of the scores of hopefuls on the syndicated Johnny Manns Stand Up And Cheer program. However, she is most known for her number-one hit, "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia", a song written by her first husband Bobby Russell, which was released on Bell Records (1950s-70s) Bell Records in November 1972. It sold over two million copies and was awarded a music recording sales certification gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America in April 1973.
During the last episode of the sixth season of The Carol Burnett Show (March 24, 1973), Lawrence received her gold record by surprise from Carol Burnett. Her first LP, The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia (Vicki Lawrence album) The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia, was issued soon after the single went gold.

"He Did With Me", Lawrences followup to "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia", reached number 75 in the United States, although it reached the top 20 of the adult contemporary music charts and also became her biggest hit in Australia, peaking at number one there in November 1973. She followed it up there with "Ships in the Night" (1974). In the fall of 1975, Lawrence managed one last minor U.S. chart entry on the Private Stock Records Private Stock label with "The Other Woman" (number 81).

In 1974, she recorded her second LP for Bell Records, Ships in the Night. The label was in the process of being bought out by Arista Records Arista, and the LP was not released in the U.S. The LP was, however, released in Australia, where she continued to have chart success. Lawrences first two LPs were released as a single CD with bonus tracks on April 1, 2014, by Real Gone Music.

She released a disco album entitled Newborn Woman late in 1979. The album produced the minor disco hit "Dont Stop the Music".

===Hosting and other work===
As an emcee, she hosted the daytime NBC version of the game show Win, Lose or Draw, as well as an unsold pilot for Mark Goodson Productions, 1990s Body Talk, and has also appeared often as a popular panelist on such game shows as Match Game, Password (game show) Password, Password Plus and Super Password Password Plus, Password Plus and Super Password Super Password, and various incarnations of the Pyramid (game show) Pyramid game show, where she was known for verbally sparring with host Dick Clark on numerous occasions. She also appeared on the 1986-89 version of Hollywood Squares, where she appeared both as herself and in character as Thelma "Mama" Harper. Lawrence was nominated a number of times for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host for the eponymous Vicki! (1992–1994), but the show was canceled after two seasons.

She tours the country with her "two-woman" show with the first half as herself and the second half done as Mama.  She can also be seen on TV in an infomercial for the Big Boss Grill. She is also known for her voice-over work as Flo on the animated series Hermie and Friends.

In 2018, Lawrence was seen promoting The Carol Burnett Show and other classic television series on the MeTV television network.
