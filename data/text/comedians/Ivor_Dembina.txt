Ivor Joseph Dembina (born 14 April 1951) is a British stand-up comedian and writer in the alternative tradition from London.<ref>{{cite web title=Ivor Dembina review url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/mar/25/ivor-dembina-review website=The Guardian Newspaper}}</ref>

==Career==
Dembina attributed his early "reputation for generally doing some decent gigs" to having "the brains to make sure there is a microphone facing the right way."<ref name=Venables170711/>

In 1987, together with club promoter, Addison Cresswell, he founded the Comedy Boom venue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in the basement of the Abercraig Lounge. It was the Edinburgh Festival Fringes first venue that exclusively hosted stand-up comedy, and ran for five years.<ref name=Venables170711/>

After that, his career veered towards performance. He created and compèred a show called Comic Abuse at Pleasance Courtyard in the late 80s, which became a successful fixture and introduced acts such as Jo Brand and Jack Dee.<ref name=Venables170711/>

Dembina runs the Hampstead Comedy Club in North London, which he founded in 1994.<ref>{{cite web title=Comedian Ivor Dembina on how money and TV altered British alternative comedy. url=http://thejohnfleming.wordpress.com/2014/03/10/comedian-ivor-dembina-on-how-money-tv-altered-british-alternative-comedy/ website=John Flemings Blog}}</ref> He is cited as an early influence by Stewart Lee.<ref>{{cite book last1=Lee first1=Stewart title=How I escaped my certain fate : the life and deaths of a stand-up comedian date=2010 publisher=Faber and Faber location=London isbn=978-0-571-25480-4}}</ref> He wrote for the first season of the Omid Djalili Show on BBC1.<ref>{{cite web title=The Omid Djalili Show Cast and Crew url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/the_omid_djalili_show/details/ website=British Comedy Guide accessdate=31 August 2014}}</ref> He appeared in the first season of Eye Spy as Jewish Dad on Channel 4.<ref>{{cite web title=Eye Spy Cast and Crew url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3002664/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast website=Internet Movie Database (IMDb)}}</ref> He was the first stand-up comedian to perform a solo comedy show at the UK Houses of Parliament.<ref name="Ivor Dembina Parliament Stand-Up">{{cite web title=Ivor Dembina Parliament Stand-Up url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/mar/16/ivor-dembina-parliament-standup website=The Guardian Newspaper}}</ref><ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite web title=Observations: A comic Strip in Westminster url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/observations-a-comic-strip-in-westminster-1923465.html website=The Independent Newspaper accessdate=31 August 2014}}</ref> 

Dembinas comedy focuses on his Jewish background and his political outlook.<ref>{{cite web title=Old Jewish Jokes 2014 review  url=http://www.wow247.co.uk/blog/2014/08/20/old-jewish-jokes/ website=The Scotsman Newspaper}}</ref> He toured his show about the Israel-Palestine conflict, This is Not a Subject For Comedy, in Israel and on the West Bank.<ref name="A perfect Subject for Comedy">{{cite web title=A perfect Subject for Comedy  url=http://www.hanitzotz.com/culture/Dembina.htm website=Hanitzotz Publishing House}}</ref> In 1998 he wrote and performed a show entitled SadoJudaism in which he talked about the worlds of fetishism and prostitution through Jewish eyes.<ref>{{cite web title=Beats me what they see in sado- masochism  url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/beats-me-what-they-see-in-sado-masochism-1-861658 website=The Scotsman Newspaper}}</ref>

Stewart Lee credits him for correcting his microphone technique during a new act competition in 1990, calling him "the Obi-Wan Kenobi of comedy".<ref name=Venables170711/>

==Social activism==
Dembina has attracted attention for his outspoken anti-Zionist and socialist views.

In 2004, while on his way to perform stand-up comedy in Israel and the West Bank, Ivor was detained for several hours by Israeli police at Ben Gurion Airport after his name reportedly turned up on a list of "known radicals".<ref>{{cite web title=Comic detained in Israel url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2004/10/13/995/comic_detained_in_Israel website=Chortle}}</ref>

In 2008, Dembina organised a comedy event called "60 Years: What A State" on Israels independence day, Yom Haatzmaut. Featuring Jeremy Hardy, Mark Steel, Reginald D Hunter and Shazia Mirza, it was on the same evening a gala event organised by the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland Zionist Federation at the Wembley Arena celebrated 60 years of the Israeli state. Ivor branded the galas headliner, American comedian Jackie Mason, a "bad Jewish joke", citing Masons support for Israel and the fact that comedian Ray Hanania, of Palestinian descent, had been dropped from supporting Mason on tour in 2002. Ivor said: "Never mind Israel not wanting to share Jerusalem with Palestinians, he wont even share a stage with one."<ref>{{cite web title=Mason rapped for Zionist gigl url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2008/04/28/6697/mason_rapped_for_Zionist_gig website=Chortle}}</ref>

In 2011, Dembina threatened legal action and called for an investigation after a protester interrupted his Edinburgh Fringe preview show at a Jewish community centre in Golders Green, accusing him of performing a "tame version for a Jewish audience" and demanding that he reveal his anti-Israel views.<ref name=demonstrators/> Other activists picketed outside and handed out flyers.<ref name=demonstrators>{{cite web title=Demonstrators picket comic’s Ivy House performance url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/51991/ivor-dembinas-show-no-joke-protester website=Jewish Chronicle Newspaper}}</ref> Ivor said afterwards: "In 25 years in Jewish comedy, during which I have performed both in Britain and abroad—including in Israel—this is the first time someone has attended a performance of mine with the apparent intention of sabotaging it."<ref name=demonstrators/>

In late 2013 and early 2014, Dembina joined other artists and writers including Nigel Kennedy, Yasmin Alibhai-Brown and Mark Steel at St Jamess Church, Piccadilly for Bethlehem Unwrapped, a festival during the Christmas season that drew attention to the Israeli West Bank barrier.<ref>{{cite web title=Bethlehem Unwrapped url=http://www.palestinecampaign.org/events/bethlehem-unwrapped/ website=PSC}}</ref>

In 2014, Dembina caused consternation among sections of the Jewish community for organising a benefit show for the people of the Gaza Strip with Daniel Kitson, Josie Long and fellow Jewish comic Andy Zaltzman.<ref>{{cite web title=FREE GAZA! url=http://www.gildedballoon.co.uk/tickets/performances.php?eventId=14:599 website=Gilded Balloon Edinburgh Fringe Website}}</ref>

Also in 2014, he angered some other Jewish comedians by banning them from his from his club because they publicly endorsed and received payment from an organisation that he claimed was racist, the Jewish National Fund.<ref>{{cite web title=JNF Boycott url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/126655/comedians-fall-out-over-israel-charity-boycott website=Jewish Chronicle Newspaper}}</ref><ref>{{cite web title=Racist Charity blacklisted url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/news/jewish-comics-blacklisted-over-support-for-racist-charity-9926891.html website=The Independent Newspaper}}</ref><ref>{{cite web title=Is the JNF Racist? url=http://www.jewishnews.co.uk/jnf-racist/ website=The Jewish News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web title=Jewish Community Divided url=http://www.beyondthejoke.co.uk/content/1297/news-jewish-comedy-community-divided-over-xmas-gig website=Beyond the Joke blog}}</ref><ref>{{cite web title=The JNF Hit Back url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/126839/jnf-hits-back-comedian-who-called-it-racist website=Jewish Chronicle Newspaper}}</ref>

In February 2015, he joined 700 other UK artists including Brian Eno, Mike Leigh and Liz Lochhead as a signatory to a boycotts of Israel cultural boycott of Israel.<ref>{{cite web title=Cultural Boycott of Israel url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/13/cultural-boycott-israel-starts-tomorrow website=The Guardian Newspaper}}</ref><ref>{{cite web title=Artists For Palestine url=http://artistsforpalestine.org.uk/pledge-signatories/}}</ref>

In 2015, Dembina also attracted the interest of the political community for his willingness to use sensitive subjects such as the Holocaust, Israel and Jewish stereotypes in his material.<ref>{{cite web title=Jewish Jokes Not Antisemetic url= https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/jewish-jokes-are-not-antisemitic-if-told-in-good-faith-10050108.html website=The Independent Newspaper}}</ref>
