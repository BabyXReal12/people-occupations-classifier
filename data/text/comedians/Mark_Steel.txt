==Early life==
Steel was adopted 10 days after he was born.<ref name="Wade">{{cite web last=Wade first=Michael title=The week with George Galloway - Nov 4 url=http://talksport.com/radio/week-george-galloway/blog/2011-11-07/week-george-galloway-nov-4 publisher=Talksport date= 7 November 2011 accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref> His adoptive father worked in insurance and his mother was a housewife who supplemented the familys income through factory work and working as a lollipop lady.<ref name=graun>{{cite web  url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/mark-steel-finding-out-who-i-am  title=Mark Steel: Finding out who I am  last1=Lee first1=Veronica date=27 June 2015  work=The Guardian access-date=27 June 2015}}</ref> He had a close relationship with his adoptive parents.<ref name=rtbc/> Steel later told UK newspaper The Guardians Veronica Lee: <blockquote>"I knew I was adopted, strangely, before I knew where babies came from. I didn’t feel different or special, and I don’t ever remember giving the slightest damn about it. I knew because my very lovely auntie Gwen would tell the story of how she got talking to a blonde girl, Frances, who had moved into a flat in the same house in London. She was 19. She was in a bit of a state because she was pregnant. Her parents didn’t know and she’d run away from home. It was 1959, so this wasn’t easy to deal with. So my auntie Gwen said to her, ‘Well, I’ve got a solution. Have the baby and give it to my brother.’ So this girl had me in 1960 and I was handed over to Doreen and Ernie."<ref name="graun"/></blockquote>

He grew up in Swanley, Kent. Steel claims that he was expelled from school for attending a cricket course without permission: "I thought, fantastic! The punishment for not coming in is that Im not allowed to come in".<ref name="Nottingham Post 15 August 2008">{{cite web   author= This is Nottingham   title= COMEDY: Mark Steel   url= http://www.nottinghampost.com/COMEDY-Mark-Steel/story-12218102-detail/story.html   date= 15 August 2008   newspaper= Nottingham Post   location= Nottingham   accessdate= 24 May 2016   deadurl= yes   archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170205010601/http://www.nottinghampost.com/comedy-mark-steel/story-12218102-detail/story.html   archivedate= 5 February 2017   df= dmy-all }}</ref> He traced his biological mother later in life but she said that she did not want to know him.<ref name="Wade"/> She died soon after Steel attempted to contact her. He learned that she was from a Scottish working-class family with an active involvement in left-wing politics, and that she had subsequently married an Italian and lived in Rimini. She had met his biological father Joe Dwek<ref name=BBCR4>{{cite AV media  people=Steel, Mark  date=9 December 2017  title=Mark Steel - Who Do I Think I Am?  trans-title=  medium=BBC Radio 4  url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08drbx2  access-date=9 December 2017  publisher=BBC }}</ref> at a party in London. Dwek was an Egyptian Sephardic Jew whose family left Egypt after Gamal Abdel Nasser became president in the 1950s.

[…] He said he remembered Frances vividly but it [Steel getting in touch by email] was all a bit of a shock because he had made all the arrangements to have me dispensed with. But she took the money and didnt go through with it, bless her."<ref name="graun"/></blockquote>

In the late 1970s his adoptive father suffered a mental breakdown and was placed into care at Stone House Hospital. Steel says that his first encounter with social injustice was when he saw how mentally ill patients were being treated in that hospital. The shabby conditions of the home reinforced Steels political beliefs.<ref name="rtbc">{{cite book last=Steel first=Mark  title= Reasons to be Cheerful publisher=Scribner UK year=2001 isbn=0-7432-0804-8}}</ref>

==Career==
Steel has given varying accounts of his early career:<ref name="Nottingham Post 15 August 2008"/> He became bored with constantly being asked how he had started in comedy and took to telling the questioner the first thing that came into his head. He is often described as having worked as a television repair man<ref>{{cite news   first=   last=   coauthors=   title=Open2.net: How did you get into comedy?   date=   publisher=   url =http://www.open2.net/marksteel/o2interview.htm   work =Open University   pages =   accessdate = 2008-10-18   language = }}</ref> but confesses that he has no technical ability whatsoever. He worked the comedy circuit for several years, and has acknowledged that his comedic influences included Alexei Sayle.<ref name="Nottingham Post 15 August 2008"/> In 1992 Steel presented a satirical radio show The Mark Steel Solution on BBC Radio 5 (former) BBC Radio 5, consisting of half-hour monologues which offered solutions to social problems.  It ran to four series. Its Not a Runner Bean, a comic autobiography, was published in 1996, and this led to a column in The Guardian which appeared between 1996 and 1999. According to Steel he was sacked because the newspaper wanted to "realign towards Tony Blair", though The Guardian denied this. In 2000 he started writing a weekly column for The Independent, which appears in the Wednesday Opinion Column.

He has written and performed several radio and television series for the BBC, and authored several books.

In 2005 he toured the UK and Ireland, where he discussed the French revolution in a light-hearted style.

==Personal life==
Steel is a supporter of Crystal Palace F.C. and Kent County Cricket Club and enjoys watching both play on occasion. He was interviewed by Jonathan Agnew on Test Match Special during the South Africa series, giving an interview on his love of cricket.<ref>Interview on BBCs Test Match Special, 1 August 2008</ref>

He has a son, Elliot Steel, and a daughter from a relationship that ended in 2006.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/heartbreak/anatomy-of-a-breakup-939706.html title=Anatomy of a break-up date=24 September 2008 work=The Independent accessdate=2009-03-31 location=London  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220230017/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/heartbreak/anatomy-of-a-breakup-939706.html  archivedate=20 February 2009}}</ref>

==Politics==
During the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, when he was in his 20s, Steels objections to  societys injustices were vented by political protests, punk rock and poetry.

Viewing the Soviet Union as "sh*t", and as a state capitalism state capitalist system rather than truly socialism socialist, Steel joined the Socialist Workers Party (UK) Socialist Workers Party (SWP) instead of the Communist Party of Great Britain.<ref name="rtbc" /> He supported strikes and demonstrations, and was present in Southall during the riot in which Death of Blair Peach Blair Peach was killed. In the early 1980s he also persuaded his mother to allow striking steelworkers to spend a night in the Steel residence.<ref name="rtbc" /> By the end of the 1980s, he had moved into a Squatting squat with his old friend Mick Hannan, before taking up residence in a flat.<ref name="rtbc" />

In 2000 Steel took part in the London Assembly elections<ref name="Independent author profile">{{cite web  url= https://www.independent.co.uk/author/mark-steel title= Authors: Mark Steel   author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->   work= The Independent  publisher=   accessdate= 24 May 2016 }}</ref> on behalf of the London Socialist Alliance (part of the Socialist Alliance (England) Socialist Alliance) in the Croydon and Sutton (London Assembly constituency) Croydon and Sutton constituency; he received 1,823 votes (1.5% of the vote).

In 2007 he left the SWP and justified his decision in his book Whats Going On? In the book he wrote that he left the party because whilst the membership base had become smaller and smaller, the members who remained became increasingly deluded  regarding the size and relevance of the organisation. He also condemned the manner in which, at a time when there was broad public support for socialist ideals, increasingly bitter and futile in-fighting on the left made political success impossible.

Alex Callinicos, International Secretary of the SWP, reviewed the book in the Socialist Review, arguing that it "evinces a kind of grandiose ignorance" and that "the only principle one can detect here is that the SWP is always in the wrong".<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=10514 title=Whats Going On? last=Callinicos first=Alex date=September 2008 work=Socialist Review accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref> Literary critic Nicholas Lezard praised the book in The Guardian, particularly for its discussion of the break-up of Steels relationship, which "gives it a poignancy and depth which at its outset one might not have expected".<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/11/mark-steel-review title=Few things are funnier than ageing and disillusionment first=Nicholas last=Lezard work=The Guardian date=11 April 2009 accessdate=16 November 2010 location=London}}</ref>
