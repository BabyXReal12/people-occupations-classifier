After leaving school, Rowe was apprenticed as a carpenter and then worked as a timber man in a tin mine. At the age of eighteen he joined the St Just in Penwith St. Just and District Operatic Society and, in addition to his bass (voice type) bass voice, locals found he had a talent for making an audience laugh. He began visiting the pubs of Cornwall to sing and joke and was quickly hailed{{by whom date=April 2018}} as Cornwall’s top comedian comic.

Rowe made his TV debut on the Westward Television programme ‘Treasure Hunt’ playing a pirate co-host. 

In addition to his appearances on stage and video, Jethro has made nine appearances on TV shows hosted by Des OConnor. His first appearance was on the Des O’Connor Tonight show in 1990, followed by a return for the Christmas Eve show later that year - the first time a comedian was invited back during one series. He also appeared five times on Jim Davidson’s The Generation Game Generation Game show, twice giving a demonstration of how to make a Pasty Cornish pasty. Jethro was also involved in one of the show’s longest sequences of blooper out-takes, removed due to his and Davidsons uncontrolled fits of laughter but later shown separately; it involved the story of Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates Hans Brinker, “the boy who put his finger in the dike”, with a pun on dyke (slang) dyke. Davidson has said that he regards Jethro as his favourite storyteller, one of his great stories being Train don’t stop Camborne Wednesdays.

He has hosted two shows of his own, The Jethro Junction, on ITV Wales & West HTV and in December 2001 appeared in front of Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Queen Elizabeth II for the Royal Variety Show.
