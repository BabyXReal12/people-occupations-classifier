She majored in drama at Bennington, and during an interview in 1994 admitted that she first wanted to perform on stage as a singer when she was in the fourth grade. She recalls being emotionally drawn to the stage after seeing Ethel Waters perform.<ref name=tour>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvdqEDBRpk;t=1m55s Carol Channing interview during the Hello, Dolly tour in 1994]</ref>

She has stated that in the fourth grade she ran for and was elected class secretary: "I stood up in class and campaigned by kidding the teachers. The other kids laughed. I loved the feeling{{mdash}}It was a very good feeling; it still is." She read the class minutes every Friday, often impersonating the children who were discussed.<ref name=Kleiner/> She also considers the fact that she was able to see plays while very young to have been an important inspiration:{{quote I was lucky enough to grow up in San Francisco, and it was the best theater town that Sol Hurok knew, and he brought everybody from all over the world. And we schoolchildren got to see them with just 50-cent tickets.<ref name=Greenville/>}}

Her election to class secretary continued through grammar and high school: "It was very good training—like stock"<ref name=Kleiner/> Those weekly sessions in front of students became a habit which she carried to Bennington College, where she would entertain every Friday night.<ref name=Kleiner/> During her junior year she began trying out for acting parts on Broadway. After playing a small part in revue, the New Yorker magazine noted her performance: "Youll be hearing more from a comedienne named Carol Channing."<ref name=Kleiner/>

The inspiration she received from that brief notice made her decide to quit school. However, it was four years before she found another acting job. During that period she performed at small functions or benefits, including some in the Catskill resorts. She also worked in Macys bakery.<ref name=Kleiner/>

==Career==
Channing was introduced to the stage while helping her mother deliver newspapers to the backstage of theatres.{{efn We went through the stage door alley (for the Curran Theatre), and I couldnt get the stage door open. My mother came and opened it very well. Anyway, my mother went to put the Monitors where they were supposed to go for the actors and the crew and the musicians, and she left me alone. And I stood there and realized – Ill never forget it because it came over me so strongly – that this is a temple. This is a cathedral. Its a mosque. Its a mother church. This is for people who have gotten a glimpse of creation and all they do is recreate it. I stood there and wanted to kiss the floorboards.<ref>{{cite web author=Faires, Robert title=The Carol You Dont Know publisher=Austin Chronicle, Online Edition date=July 22, 2005 url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2005-07-22/arts_feature.html accessdate=May 10, 2006}}</ref>}}

Her first job on stage in New York City New York was in Marc Blitzsteins No for an Answer, starting January 5, 1941, at the Mecca Temple (later New Yorks City Center). She was 19 years old.

Decades later, Arden would play Dolly in a road company after Channing finally relinquished her signature role.

Five years later, Channing had a featured role in Lend an Ear (1948), for which she received her Theatre World Award and launched her as a star performer. Channing credited illustrator Al Hirschfeld for helping make her a star when he put her image in his widely published illustrations.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIY6i_BtTLo;t=32s Al Hirschfeld Exhibit], WPIX News, 2013</ref> She said that his drawing of her as a flapper was what helped her get the lead in her next play, the Jule Styne and Anita Loos musical, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (musical) Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.

In 1956, Channing married her manager and publicist Charles Lowe. During the 1950s, he produced the Burns and Allen comedy show, which starred George Burns and Gracie Allen.<ref name=Orlando/> When Allen was forced to discontinue performing due to medical problems, she saw that Burns was in need of a partner to play off of on stage since he was best as a straight man. She remembered that Channing, like her, had one of the most distinctive and recognizable voices in show business, and Lowe asked Channing if she would perform with Burns during his shows. She accepted immediately, and Channing worked on and off with Burns through the late 1950s. Burns also appeared in her TV special, "An Evening with Carol Channing", in 1966.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ool5UYQtID8;t=43m42s title=An Evening with Carol Channing 1966 first= last=keywslt date=20 October 2015 publisher= via=YouTube}}</ref>

===Hello, Dolly! (1964)===

Channing came to national prominence as the star of Jerry Hermans Hello, Dolly! (musical) Hello, Dolly! (1964). Her performance as Dolly Levi won the Tony Award for Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical Best Actress in a Musical. She recalls that playwright Thornton Wilder so loved the musical, which was based on his play, The Merchant of Yonkers, that he came once a week.<ref name=Orlando/> He also planned to rewrite his 1942 play The Skin of Our Teeth, with Channing playing the parts of both Mrs. Antrobus and Sabina, but died before he could finish it.<ref name=Orlando/>

Her role became widely popular in the 1960s, and she was often invited to major events, including those at the White House, where she might sing. In 1964, for instance, she was invited to the Democratic convention where she sang a take-off song, "Hello, Lyndon", for Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ)s campaign.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbFmiECNojA Carol Channing at DNC for Lyndon Johnson, 1964], FilmArchives NYC</ref> She was a favorite of Lady Bird Johnson, who once gave her a massive bouquet after a show.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwvdqEDBRpk;t=4m26s title=Carol Channing Interview 1994 Hello, Dolly tour date=October 24, 2010 publisher=YouTube}}</ref> 

The old-fashioned plot of Hello, Dolly, when first described, might seem uninspired, says columnist Dick Kleiner:{{quote But then you sit in the audience and Carol Channing comes out, turns on her huge eyes and monumental smile—and you sit there with a silly grin on your face for 2 1/2 hours, bathed in the benevolent spell of a great comedienne...It is hard to imagine her doing anything else but making people smile. She is that human curio, the born female comic.<ref name=Kleiner>Kleiner, Dick. "Analyze Hello, Dolly and You Get Carol Channing", The Progress-Index (Petersburg, Virginia), July 9, 1964.</ref>}}

The show had first opened on Broadway on January 16, 1964, and by the time the show closed in late December 1970, it had become the longest-running musical in Broadway history, with nearly 3,000 performances. Besides Channing, six other stars played the title role during those seven years: Ginger Rogers, Martha Raye, Betty Grable, Pearl Bailey, Phyllis Diller and Ethel Merman.<ref>"Hello Dolly Closing After Record Run", Cincinnati Enquirer, December 1, 1970.</ref>

Al Hirschfelds illustration of her was printed on the front page of the "Sunday Theatre" section of the New York Times, which she feels captured the essence of her character: "How did the great Hirschfeld know precisely what I was thinking? ...

Due to her success on Broadway in Hello Dolly! and her co-starring role in Thoroughly Modern Millie, Channing attracted the attentions of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, who were interested in starring her in a sitcom.
