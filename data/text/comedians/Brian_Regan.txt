Brian Joseph Regan ({{IPAc-en ˈ r iː ɡ ən}}) (born June 2, 1958) is an American stand-up comedian who uses observational comedy observational, sarcasm sarcastic, and self-deprecation self-deprecating humor. His performances are clean as he refrains from profanity and off-color humor. Regans material typically covers everyday events, such as shipping a package with United Parcel Service UPS, mortgages, and visits to the optometrist. While he does not define himself as youth-oriented, Regan makes frequent references to childhood, including little league baseball, grade school spelling bees, and science projects. Body language and facial expressions make his stand-up act atypically physical.  His clean, off-center humor has been praised by critics and contemporaries alike and Regan enjoys a fan base that crosses age groups.{{citation needed (lead) date=February 2015}}
