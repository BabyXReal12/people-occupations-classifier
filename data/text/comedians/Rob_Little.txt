}}</ref> Already at a young age, Little knew he wanted to become a comedian. When Little was 5 years old, he was watching his current inspiration, comedian George Carlin, do a comedy bit on TV when he and his parents were heading to Mackinac Island for a family vacation. Because his parents were asleep, he was able to view this adult-oriented comedy. Little looked back on that experience and thought to himself, "Thats [comedy is] what I want to do the rest of my life."<ref name="Oakland">{{cite web

==Career==

===Before Comedy===
After graduating with a degree in business and information sciences, Little has had several jobs. Before comedy, he worked for General Motors in Detroit, Kmart in Troy, Michigan, and IBM in Dearborn, Michigan. At IBM, Little was a computer programmer. Though this position was lucrative, Rob stated that it was not for him. He was fired from IBM due to an all-company email that he sent which read, "If you arent happy here, quit your job and follow your dream." Little viewed this as a blessing in disguise because it was after this moment in 1998 that he started becoming a relevant player in the world of comedy.<ref>{{cite web
