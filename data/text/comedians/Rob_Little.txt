Rob Little (born December 24, 1972) is an American comedian and actor from Pinconning, Michigan.  He has been performing stand-up comedy since 1998 and has been acting in movies and television.  He has also produced two straight to DVD comedy specials based on his stand-up. His humor is often self-deprecating, although he prides himself as the "happiest comic in America."
==Early life==
Growing up, Little had a difficult time in elementary school due to being overweight. In an interview, Little stated, "In elementary school, kids would always pull food away from me at lunchtime saying mean, hurtful things like... Let go of my sandwich!".
Already at a young age, Little knew he wanted to become a comedian. When Little was 5 years old, he was watching his current inspiration, comedian George Carlin, do a comedy bit on TV when he and his parents were heading to Mackinac Island for a family vacation. Because his parents were asleep, he was able to view this adult-oriented comedy. Little looked back on that experience and thought to himself, "Thats [comedy is] what I want to do the rest of my life."
==Education==
Little went to Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant, Michigan where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration majoring in M.I.S. (Management Information Systems).  He also has an associates degree in Data Processing from Delta College (Michigan) Delta College in Bay City, Michigan.
==Career==

===Before Comedy===
After graduating with a degree in business and information sciences, Little has had several jobs. Before comedy, he worked for General Motors in Detroit, Kmart in Troy, Michigan, and IBM in Dearborn, Michigan. At IBM, Little was a computer programmer. Though this position was lucrative, Rob stated that it was not for him. He was fired from IBM due to an all-company email that he sent which read, "If you arent happy here, quit your job and follow your dream." Little viewed this as a blessing in disguise because it was after this moment in 1998 that he started becoming a relevant player in the world of comedy.
