I dont care. This has come about from a completely genuine desire to do a piece of theatrical work. Bloody hell, how long has the Donmar had Hollywood stars going there for £200? Hes six-foot five.

Henry received widespread critical acclaim in the role. Charles Spencer (journalist) Charles Spencer in the Daily Telegraph said "This is one of the most astonishing debuts in Shakespeare I have ever seen. It is impossible to praise too highly Henrys courage in taking on so demanding and exposed a role, and then performing it with such authority and feeling."<ref>{{cite news last=Spencer first=Charles title=Othello with Lenny Henry at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, review publisher=Daily Telegraph date=19 February 2008 url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturecritics/charlesspencer/4696028/Othello-with-Lenny-Henry-at-the-West-Yorkshire-Playhouse-review.html accessdate=5 April 2008  location=London, England}}</ref> Michael Billington (critic) Michael Billington in The Guardian noted "Henrys voice may not always measure up to the rhetorical music of the verse, but there is a simple dignity to his performance that touches one".<ref>{{cite news author=Michael Billington (critic) Michael Billington title=Othello publisher=The Guardian date=19 February 2008 url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/feb/19/othello-west-yorkshire-playhouse  accessdate=5 April 2008 location=London}}</ref> Lynne Walker (critic) Lynne Walker of The Independent said of Henry that his "emotional dynamism is in no doubt. The frenzy within his imagination explodes into rage and, finally, wretchedness. Its not a subtle reading but it works powerfully in this context."<ref>{{cite news last=Walker first=Lynne publisher=The Independent date=19 February 2008 url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/first-night-othello-quarry-theatre-west-yorkshire-playhouse-leeds-1626089.html accessdate=5 April 2008 title=First Night: Othello, Quarry Theatre, West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds location=London, UK}}</ref>
