Elaine Iva May (Name at birth n√©e Berlin; born April 21, 1932) is an American screenwriter, film director, actress, and comedienne. She made her initial impact in the 1950s from her improvisational comedy routines with Mike Nichols, performing as Nichols and May. After her duo with Nichols ended, May subsequently developed a career as a director and screenwriter.

Her screenwriting has been twice nominated for the Academy Awards Academy Award, for Heaven Can Wait (1978 film) Heaven Can Wait (1978) and the Nichols-directed Primary Colors (film) Primary Colors (1998).
May is celebrated for the string of films she directed in the 1970s: her 1971 black comedy A New Leaf (film) A New Leaf, in which she also starred; her 1972 dark romantic comedy The Heartbreak Kid (1972 film) The Heartbreak Kid; and her 1976 gritty drama Mikey and Nicky, starring John Cassavetes and Peter Falk. In 1996, she reunited with Nichols to write the screenplay for The Birdcage, directed by Nichols.

After studying acting with theater coach Maria Ouspenskaya in Los Angeles, she moved to Chicago in 1955 and became a founding member of the Compass Players, an improvisational theater group. May began working alongside Nichols, who was also in the group, and together they began writing and performing their own comedy sketches, which were enormously popular. In 1957 they both quit the group to form their own stage act, Nichols and May, in New York. Jack Rollins (producer) Jack Rollins, who produced most of Woody Allens films, said their act was "so startling, so new, as fresh as could be. I was stunned by how really good they were."
