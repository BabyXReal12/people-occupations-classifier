==2012 tax avoidance controversy==
In June 2012, Carrs involvement in an alleged K2 (tax scheme) K2 tax avoidance scheme came to light after an investigation by The Times newspaper.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/19/tax-scheme-jimmy-carr-hmrc title=Tax avoidance scheme used by Jimmy Carr investigated by HMRC newspaper=The Guardian date=19 June 2012 accessdate=19 June 2012 location=London first=Shiv last=Malik}}</ref> The scheme is understood to involve UK earners "quitting" their job and signing new employment contracts with offshore Shell corporation shell companies based in the low tax jurisdiction of Jersey. Then-Prime Minister David Cameron commented on the issue: "People work hard, they pay their taxes, they save up to go to one of his shows. They buy the tickets. He is taking the money from those tickets and he, as far as I can see, is putting all of that into some very dodgy tax avoiding schemes."<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18521468 title=Jimmy Carr tax affairs morally wrong – Cameron newspaper=BBC News date=20 June 2012 accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref> Carr has since pulled out of the scheme, apologizing for "a terrible error of judgement".<ref name=autogenerated1/>

Viewing figures of the episode of his topical show 8 out of 10 Cats, recorded on the day of his apology and broadcast the following day, almost doubled compared with the previous week.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18569728 publisher=BBC News title=Jimmy Carr: Tax row sees Channel 4 ratings soar date=24 June 2012 accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref> Earlier in 2012, Carr had lampooned people who avoid paying their taxes during the second series of Channel 4s satirical news programme 10 OClock Live.<ref name=autogenerated1/> A sketch from the show, in which he poked fun at the 1% tax rate of Barclays Barclays Bank and described tax lawyers as being "aggressive" and "amoral", was regarded as having "come back to haunt him".<ref name=autogenerated1/>

In February 2018, Carr appeared on Room 101 (TV series) Room 101, where he talked about the controversy. Though he admitted that what he did is wrong, he said that there was some level of hypocrisy in the comments Cameron had made about him in 2012, noting that members of Camerons family and Elizabeth II Queen Elizabeth II have subsequently been mentioned in the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers tax evasion scandals. Carr said that the law should become clearer by eliminating any loopholes, instead of leaving it up to people to decide what is morally right.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/tax-cheat-jimmy-carr-calls-11896308  title=Jimmy Carr say legal loopholes that let him avoid tax should be closed  last=Jefferies  first=Mark  date=22 January 2018  website=Mirror Online  access-date=1 March 2018}}</ref>

==Personal life==
At age 26, he had what he calls "an early midlife crisis", during which he lost his Catholic Church Catholic faith.<ref>{{cite news author=Brian Logan  url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jun/22/will-jimmy-carrs-career-survive?newsfeed=true  title=Will Jimmy Carrs career survive the tax avoidance  publisher=Guardian  date= 22 June 2012 accessdate=20 May 2013  location=London}}</ref> He has since made comments critical of organized religion organised religion.
