Charles Partlow "Chic" Sale (August 25, 1885 – November 7, 1936) was an United States American actor and Vaudeville vaudevillian. He was a son of Frank and Lillie Belle (née Partlow) Sale, and the brother of actress/writer Virginia Sale Virginia Sale-Wren.

==Career==
Sale was born in South Dakota and raised in Urbana, Illinois. In 1920, after a tour wherein he played "rural parts," he was engaged by Christie Studios on Gower Street, Hollywood Gower Street in Los Angeles. According to Grace Kingsley in the Jan. 28 edition of the Los Angeles Times, page II11, "It now comes to light that Chic Sale, appearing at the Orpheum Theatre (Los Angeles, California) Orpheum this week, will as soon as his present tour is finished, about the middle of next month, return to town in the Capacity of a Christie star. Mr. Sales first photoplay will be a five-reeler, adapted from Irvin S. Cobbs The Smart Aleck, after which he will be starred in other well-known stories suitable to his talents." The item goes on to mention that Charles Christie, business head of the Christie studio, entered into a contract with Exceptional Pictures to produce the Sale film, to be distributed through Robertson-Cole, and notes Sales occasional appearances in the Ziegfeld Follies and the Shubert Organization Shubert Winter Garden Theatre Winter Garden shows. The movie was eventually named His Nibs (film) His Nibs, and co-starred Colleen Moore. Chic played many of the parts himself, the film being a spoof of the sort of the "hick", backwater characterizations that were his specialty.

In 1929, inspired by a carpenter named Lem Putt from his hometown of Urbana, Illinois Urbana, Sale wrote The Specialist, a play about an outhouse builder.<ref name = "Welsh">{{cite book  title= This Old Farm   author= Roger Welsh  publisher= Voyageur Press   location=  url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OnaNrR9-YEwC&pg=PA55&dq=chic+sale+the+specialist&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjYut6nmuDRAhWI6yYKHWLqC8kQ6AEIRTAI#v=onepage&q=chic%20sale%20the%20specialist&f=false  date=1999  pages=51–59   isbn = 9781610605489   accessdate = 26 January 2017}}</ref> Because copyright infringement was widespread in Vaudeville, Sale enlisted the aid of two newspapermen to adapt The Specialist into a book. This enjoyed great success, and Sale spent the next several months responding to fan mail.

Sale had a career in Hollywood, appearing in various comic roles until his death from pneumonia in 1936. In contrast to his comic roles, one of his loftier appearances came as Abraham Lincoln President Abraham Lincoln in 1935. The Perfect Tribute was a short film dramatizing Lincolns disappointment at the meagre reaction to his Gettysburg Address. He encounters a dying and blind soldier who, not knowing he is addressing the President himself, tells Lincoln how inspiring the speech was.{{citation needed date=August 2015}}

Although an obscure figure today, Sale was a well-known popular culture figure during the 1930s, and was often the subject of jokes by comedians like Groucho Marx, usually in reference to The Specialist. Chic is also mentioned as an aside late in the Marx Brothers film, Animal Crackers (1930 film) Animal Crackers, in a conversation between Ravelli (Chico Marx) and Grouchos character, Captain Spaulding (Groucho Marx) Captain Spaulding). For many years—even after his death—"Chic Sale" was used as a euphemism for an outhouse. He is known to have found this unflattering, calling it "a terrible thing to have happen".<ref name = "Welsh"/>
