==Personal life==
From 1981 to 1987, Leifer was married to comic Ritch Shydner, whose gentile status troubled Leifers father.<ref name=NewYorkTimes/>

In 1996, Leifer met Lori Wolf, a Jewish real estate executive, when they shared a table at a Project Angel Food charity dinner in Los Angeles. Although Leifer had identified as heterosexual up until then, she later contacted Wolf through the host of their table, though Wolf initially rebuffed Leifers overtures because Wolf was in a relationship at the time. Wolf contacted Leifer weeks later, after Wolf had ended her relationship, and began one with Leifer. They moved in together in 2005, and in acclimating herself to Wolfs pets, Leifer became an animal rights activist. It was for this reason that she chose North Shore Animal League as her charity when she appeared in The Celebrity Apprentice.<ref name=NewYorkTimes/> In 2006 they purchased a $3.2-million, {{convert 5000 sqft m2 adj=on}} home in the Santa Monica Hills,<ref name=LATimes>{{cite news  url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/30/realestate/re-hotprop30   work=The Los Angeles Times   title=Stand-up adds a new home, baby to routine   first=Ruth   last=Ryon   date=2006-07-30}}</ref> as part of their preparations to adopt their nine-month-old son, Bruno Leifer-Wolf, who was born in Guatemala in 2007.<ref name=NewYorkTimes/><ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117960931.html?categoryid=26&cs=1   work=Variety (magazine) Variety   title=Bruno Leifer-Wolf   date=2007-03-11}}</ref> That year, Leifer proposed to Wolf over dinner at the Palm Restaurant in Beverly Hills.
