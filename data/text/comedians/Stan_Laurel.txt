After making his first film Nuts in May (film) Nuts in May, Universal Studios Universal offered him a contract. The contract was soon cancelled during a reorganisation at the studio. Among the films in which Dahlberg and Laurel appeared together was the 1922 parody Mud and Sand.

By 1924, Laurel had given up the stage for full-time film work, under contract with Joe Rock for 12 two-reel comedies. The contract had one unusual stipulation: that Dahlberg was not to appear in any of the films. Rock thought that her temperament was hindering Laurels career. In 1925, she started interfering with Laurels work, so Rock offered her a cash settlement and a one-way ticket back to her native Australia, which she accepted.<ref>Bergan 1992, p. 33.</ref> The 12 two-reel comedies were Mandarin Mix-Up (1924), Detained (film) Detained (1924), Monsieur Dont Care (1924), West of Hot Dog (1924), Somewhere in Wrong (1925), Twins (1925 film) Twins (1925), Pie-Eyed (1925), The Snow Hawk (1925), Navy Blue Days (1925), The Sleuth (1925 film) The Sleuth (1925), Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde (1925), Half a Man (film) Half a Man (1925).

File:Laurel and Hardy in Lucky Dog.jpg thumb left Laurel with Hardy in The Lucky Dog (1921 film) The Lucky Dog (1921), long before they became a team.
Laurel next signed with the Hal Roach studio, where he began directing films, including a 1926 production called Yes, Yes, Nanette. He intended to work primarily as a writer and director.

Oliver Hardy, another member of the Hal Roach Studios Comedy All Star players, was injured in a kitchen mishap in 1927, and Laurel was asked to return to acting. Laurel and Hardy began sharing the screen in Slipping Wives, Duck Soup (1927 film) Duck Soup (1927), and With Love and Hisses. The two became friends and their comic chemistry soon became obvious. Roach Studios supervising director Leo McCarey noticed the audience reaction to them and began teaming them, leading to the creation of the Laurel and Hardy series later that year.

Together, the two men began producing a huge body of short films, including The Battle of the Century, Should Married Men Go Home?, Two Tars, Be Big!, Big Business (1929 film) Big Business, and many others. Laurel and Hardy successfully made the transition to talking films with the short Unaccustomed As We Are in 1929. They also appeared in their first feature in one of the revue sequences of The Hollywood Revue of 1929, and the following year they appeared as the comic relief in the lavish all-colour (in Technicolor) musical feature The Rogue Song. Their first starring feature Pardon Us was released in 1931. They continued to make both features and shorts until 1935, including their 1932 three-reeler The Music Box (film) The Music Box, which won an Academy Award for Live Action Short Film Academy Award for Best Short Subject.

===Trouble at Roach Studio===
During the 1930s, Laurel was involved in a dispute with Hal Roach which resulted in the termination of his contract. Roach maintained separate contracts for Laurel and Hardy that expired at different times, so Hardy remained at the studio and was "teamed" with Harry Langdon for the 1939 film Zenobia (film) Zenobia. The studio discussed a series of films co-starring Hardy with Patsy Kelly to be called "The Hardy Family." But Laurel sued Roach over the contract dispute. Eventually, the case was dropped and Laurel returned to Roach. The first film that Laurel and Hardy made after Laurel returned was A Chump at Oxford. Subsequently, they made Saps at Sea, which was their last film for Roach.

===20th Century Fox===

In 1941, Laurel and Hardy signed a contract at Twentieth Century Fox 20th Century Fox to make ten films over five years. During the war years, their work became more standardised and less successful, though The Bullfighters and Jitterbugs did receive some praise.

In 1947, Laurel returned to England when he and Hardy went on a six-week tour of the United Kingdom, and the duo were mobbed wherever they went. Laurels homecoming to Ulverston took place in May, and the duo were greeted by thousands of fans outside the Coronation Hall.<ref name="nwmail"/> The North-West Evening Mail Evening Mail noted: "Oliver Hardy remarked to our reporter that Stan had talked about Ulverston for the past 22 years and he thought he had to see it."<ref name="nwmail">[http://www.nwemail.co.uk/memories/stan-at-queen-s-first-royal-variety-show-1.1015949 "Stan at Queens first Royal Variety Show"] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201221344/http://www.nwemail.co.uk/memories/stan-at-queen-s-first-royal-variety-show-1.1015949  date=1 February 2014 }}. North West Evening Mail.</ref> The tour included a Royal Command Performance for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Queen Elizabeth in London.<ref name="nwmail"/> The success of the tour led them to spend the next seven years touring the UK and Europe.

Around this time, Laurel found out that he had diabetes, so he encouraged Hardy to find solo projects which he did, taking parts in John Wayne and Bing Crosby films.

In 1950, Laurel and Hardy were invited to France to make a feature film. The film was a disaster, a Franco-Italian co-production titled Atoll K. (The film was entitled Utopia in the US and Robinson Crusoeland in the UK.) Both stars were noticeably ill during the filming. Upon returning to the United States, they spent most of their time recovering. In 1952, Laurel and Hardy toured Europe successfully, and they returned in 1953 for another tour of the continent. During this tour, Laurel fell ill and was unable to perform for several weeks.<ref>Bergen 1992, p. 118.</ref>

In May 1954, Hardy had a heart attack and cancelled the tour. In 1955, they were planning to do a television series called Laurel and Hardys Fabulous Fables based on childrens stories. The plans were delayed after Laurel suffered a stroke on 25 April 1955, from which he recovered. But as the team was planning to get back to work, his partner Hardy had a massive stroke on 14 September 1956, which resulted in his being unable to return to acting.
