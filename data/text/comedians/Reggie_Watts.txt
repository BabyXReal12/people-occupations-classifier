==Performance style==
Wattss solo shows are completely improvised and consist of him singing and rapping both with words and with Sound poetry, accompanying himself by either beatboxing, performing vocal basslines into a loop machine, or simply by playing the keyboard. His act also showcases his trademark style of standup comedy, consisting of him rapidly alternating between topics of discussion in both rational and nonsensical manners, making random sounds and noises, and speaking in other accents and languages at unexpected times, all with the intent of playfully and comically disorienting his audiences.<ref name="guardian review">{{cite web title=Reggie Watts â€“ review url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jun/19/reggie-watts-review last=Logan first=Brian date=19 June 2013 publisher=The Guardian accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref>
