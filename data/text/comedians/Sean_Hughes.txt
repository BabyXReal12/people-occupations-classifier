Sean Hughes (10 November 1965 – 16 October 2017) was an English-born Irish stand-up comedian, writer and actor. He starred in his own Channel 4 television show Seans Show and was one of the regular team captains on the BBC Two musical panel game Never Mind the Buzzcocks.

==Early life==
Hughes was born in Archway, London, but spent most of his youth in Firhouse, Dublin. His mother, who was from Cork (city) Cork met his father, who was from Dublin, on a London bus. His mother intended to train as a nurse but the plan never materialised. His father worked in a telephone exchange and was also a driving instructor. At the age of six Hughes moved to Dublin and lived with his paternal grandmother.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/24/sean-hughes-my-family-values title=Sean Hughes: My family values first=Interview by Nikki last=Spencer date=24 April 2015 publisher= accessdate=16 October 2017 via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>  He attended Coláiste Éanna in Ballyroan, Dublin Ballyroan.

Writing in The Guardian, Bruce Dessau noted of Hughess early years that:

<blockquote>[He] used to talk about how sounding like a Cockney in an Irish school was not easy. He later quipped that he spent "most of my childhood in a headlock". Not surprisingly his Mary Poppins accent soon developed a lilting local burr. Making schoolfriends laugh was a classic defence mechanism and he even set up comedy gigs at his school. What started out as a hobby quickly became a career.<ref name="Guardian obituary">{{cite news  last= Dessau  first= Bruce   authorlink= Bruce Dessau  title= Sean Hughes obituary  url= https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/16/sean-hughes-obituary  date= 16 October 2017  newspaper= The Guardian  location=London  accessdate=16 October 2017 }}</ref></blockquote>

It was reported that Hughes was a close friend of the late American comedian Bill Hicks, but Hughes stated this was not true. In a 2014 interview, he explained, "It says on my Wikipedia page that I was good friends with him. I wasnt! We were in Australia together, so we hung out. I did get to know him a little bit, which was a real pleasure. When I saw him I just went, Thats the best comic Im going to see in my lifetime."<ref>{{Cite news title=Stand-up countdown Sean Hughes first=Ben last=Williams work=Time Out date=25 March 2014 quote=It says on my Wikipedia page that I was good friends with him.
