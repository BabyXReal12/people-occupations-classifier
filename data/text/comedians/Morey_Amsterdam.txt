==Early life==
Amsterdam was born in Chicago, Illinois, the youngest of the three sons of  Max and Jennie (Finder) Amsterdam, Jewish immigrants from Austria-Hungary.<ref>Some biographies list him as born in San Francisco because his father was a violinist with the San Francisco Symphony.</ref>

He began working in vaudeville in 1922 as the Straight man (stock character) straight man for his older brothers jokes. He was a cello cellist, a skill he used throughout his career. By 1924, he was working in a speakeasy operated by Al Capone.<ref name=nyt/>

After being caught in the middle of a gunfight, Amsterdam moved to California and worked writing jokes. His enormous repertoire, and his ability to come up with a joke on any subject, earned him the nickname The Human Joke Machine. He sometimes performed with a mock machine on his chest, hanging by a strap. He turned a hand crank and paper rolled out; he would then pretend to read the machines joke, although actually the paper was blank.

Amsterdams reputation for humor preceded him. Hal Block tells of Amsterdam walking up Sixth Avenue in New York City and meeting an old friend. "Where have you been?" the friend asked. "Sick," Amsterdam replied, "Ive been in bed with a cold." His friend looked at him and asked, "Whats so funny about that?"<ref>{{Cite news newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal (republished from Colliers)  date=October 18, 1950  page=M24 last=Block  first=Hal  title=A Comics Life Isnt Funny}}</ref>

During the 1930s, Amsterdam was a regular on Al Pearce The Al Pearce Show radio program, and by 1937 was the master of ceremonies on The Night Club of the Air. Amsterdam also had a notable career as a songwriter, with his first popular success being "Why Oh Why Did I Ever Leave Wyoming".

Amsterdam was credited as the lyricist on the 1945 Andrews Sisters hit "Rum and Coca-Cola". However, the original song was written and performed by Trinidadian calypso singer Lord Invader, and composed by Lionel Belasco. Amsterdam had altered some lyrics for the Andrews Sisters record, and was subsequently involved in a copyright suit over the song, which dragged on until 1948. In the end, Lord Invader was given a substantial royalty payment for having written the lyrics of original piece, while Amsterdam retained the credit (and the publishing rights) for his revised version of the lyric.

In the early 1940s, Amsterdam was a screenwriter, contributing dialogue for two East Side Kids films. He is listed as screenwriter for the 1943 film The Ghost and the Guest and 1944s Bowery Champs.

By 1947, he was performing on three daily radio shows. Beginning in 1948, he appeared on the radio show Stop Me If Youve Heard This One. The Morey Amsterdam Show aired on CBS radio from July 10, 1948, to February 15, 1949. For three months, it was on both radio and television with different scripts for the same premise and cast. He also did a radio show called the Laugh and Swing Club, broadcasting from the Filmart Theater on Vine Street in Hollywood, in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
