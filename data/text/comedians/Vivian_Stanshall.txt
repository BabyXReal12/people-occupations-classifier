Vivian Stanshall (born Victor Anthony Stanshall; 21 March 1943 – 5 March 1995) was an English singer-songwriter, musician, author, poet and wit, best known for his work with the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, for his exploration of the British upper classes in Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (as a Rawlinson End radio series for John Peel, as an Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (recording) audio recording, as a book and as a Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (film) film), and for acting as Master of Ceremonies on Mike Oldfields album Tubular Bells.<ref>{{cite web url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2ba0c45fa3 title=Vivian Stanshall work=BFI}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Stanshall was born on 21 March 1943 at the Radcliffe Maternity Home in Shillingford, Oxfordshire, and christened Victor Anthony. He lived with his mother Eileen (née Wadeson) while his father, Victor Stanshall (1909–1990) served in the Royal Air Force RAF during World War II. His father changed his name to Victor in preference to his given name Vivian. Stanshall described this early period as the happiest time of his childhood.

When the war ended, his father returned but the young Victor found him difficult and comparatively stern after having been alone with his mother.<ref>Vivian Stanshall, the early years, aka Crank., 1991 BBC Two, 1991</ref> The family moved to the fathers hometown of Walthamstow, Essex, where Stanshalls younger brother Mark was born in 1949. With six years between them, the brothers were never close.<ref name="BBC Radio 4 1994">Vivian Stanshall: Essex Teenager to Renaissance Man (1994), BBC Radio 4</ref> Stanshall studied at Walthamstow College of Art, where he met fellow students Ian Dury and Peter Greenaway.<ref name=ODNB_Dury>{{cite web title=Dury, Ian Robins (1942–2000) url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=73862&back= website=ODNB accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref>

About this time, the Stanshall family moved to the Essex coastal town of Leigh-on-Sea. He attended Southend High School for Boys until 1959. As a young man, Victor Stanshall (known as Vic) earned money doing various odd jobs at the Kursaal (amusement park) Kursaal fun fair in nearby Southend-on-Sea. These included working as a bingo (card game) bingo caller and spending the winter painting the fairground attractions. To set aside enough money to get through art school (his father having refused to fund this), Stanshall spent a year in the British Merchant Navy merchant navy. He said he was a very bad waiter, but became a great teller of tall tales.<ref name="BBC Radio 4 1994"/>

Stanshall enrolled at the Central School of Art and Design in London. He joined fellow students in forming a band (including Rodney Slater (musician) Rodney Slater, Roger Ruskin Spear and Neil Innes, who was studying art at Goldsmiths College). Innes said of their first meeting: "We first met in a big Irish pub in South London, the New Cross Arms ... he was quite plump in those days, and he was wearing Billy Bunter check trousers, a Victorian frock coat, black coat tails, horrible little oval, violet-tinted pince-nez glasses, he had a euphonium under his arm, and large rubber false ears. And I thought, well, this is an interesting character."<ref>Stephen Frys BBC Radio 4 tribute.</ref> About this time, Stanshall changed his first name to "Vivian", the name his father had abandoned. This was not made his legal name until 1977.<ref>"Interview with Ki Longfellow-Stanshall", The Bristolian, May 1988</ref> Those who knew him from his student days continued to call him Vic.

== Bonzo years ==
File:Fenklup1968BonzoDogDooDah5.jpg {{largethumb}} Stanshall with The Bonzo Dog Band on the Television in the Netherlands Dutch TV show Fenklup, 1968
{{Main Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band}}
The band was named after a word game that Stanshall played with co-founder Rodney Slater, in which they cut up sentences and juxtaposed fragments to form new ones. "Bonzo Dog/Dada" was one result which they liked. The band initially performed under this name but grew tired of explaining what Dada meant and so it became the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, "doo-dah" being a Placeholder name quaint expression that both Rodneys mother and Vivian used to describe everyday objects; later the name was shortened to The Bonzo Dog Band, or just The Bonzos.

Much of the bands original repertoire was based on comedic re-workings of songs from the 1920s and 30s, found on 78rpm 78 records, bought for penny pence from local flea markets.<ref name="Originals" />

For a while the band operated semi-professionally, playing local pubs and the college circuit. After acquiring a manager they went full-time and were booked on the working mens club circuit, mainly in the north of England. The band dominated their lives, as they frequently travelled to low-paying gigs in an old van crammed with any number of musical instruments, an assortment of props, and prop robots. In 1967, they appeared in The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour (film) Magical Mystery Tour television special, where they played Stanshalls "Death Cab for Cutie (song) Death Cab for Cutie" during the strip club scene. The appearance led to a spot as the house band on Do Not Adjust Your Set,  a weekly childrens television revue show that was also notable for early appearances by most of the Monty Python team.<ref>{{cite web url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6973c8f7 title=Do Not Adjust Your Set No. 2 publisher=BFI}}</ref>

According to their manager/agent Gerry Bron, after a perhaps ill-advised agreement that the band should be left to their own artistic devices, Stanshall was allowed several weeks in a hired rehearsal space to write songs for the new Bonzo Dog Band album. When Bron arrived at the location to check the progress of these endeavours, he found that Stanshall had not written anything at all and had instead built a variety of hutches for his pet rabbits.<ref name="Originals">Originals – Vivian Stanshall: The Canyons of His Mind, BBC/October Films, BBC4, 2004</ref>  Bron mentioned in a TV documentary that this occurred in May 1968 in a hall in Acton, West London.{{citation needed date=December 2016}} The actual location is Askew Road Church hall at the start of Bassein Park Road in Shepherds Bush.{{citation needed date=December 2016}} The date would suggest that these were rehearsals for the Doughnut in Grannys Greenhouse album. During recordings for the album proper at Morgan Studios, Stanshall, wearing just a rabbits head and underpants, interviewed members of the public in Willesden High Road. On the album track "We Are Normal", one interviewee can be heard to remark, "Hes got a head on him like a rabbit."{{citation needed date=December 2016}}

Later in 1968 the Bonzos scored a surprise top-ten hit with a "Im the Urban Spaceman" produced by Apollo C. Vermouth aka Paul McCartney.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/515090/ title=Do Not Adjust Your Set (1967–69) publisher=BFI Screenonline}}</ref> Meanwhile, the band toured incessantly and recorded a multitude of radio sessions for the BBC, alongside several albums. They also embarked upon two poorly organised but well-received tours of the United States (Neil Innes remembers that the band were reportedly stopped by a local U.S. sheriff and asked if they were carrying any firearms or drugs. When they denied both, the officer asked how they were going to defend themselves. Stanshall piped up from the back of the minibus, "With good manners!") and it was during the particularly disastrously organised second tour that they decided to break up, partly because of Stanshalls growing stage fright—combined with increasing use of valium to help this—but also due to anger with their management, after Spears wife suffered a miscarriage while he was away, and no-one informed him. The band subsequently decided to split whilst they were still friends. In March 1970, the band played their last show at Loughborough University.

==After the Bonzos==
Stanshall formed a number of short-lived groups during 1970 alone, including biG GRunt (formed while the Bonzos were still on their farewell tour, and including fellow Bonzos Roger Ruskin Spear and Dennis Cowan and featuring Anthony Bubs White on guitar), The Sean Head Showband (again featuring Dennis Cowan and Bubs White), Gargantuan Chums, and the slightly longer-lived Bonzo Dog Freaks with Neil Innes and the ever-faithful Cowan and White (this conglomerate was also known simply as Freaks). Early that year, biG GRunt recorded a well-received session for BBC Radio 1 Disc Jockey John Peel, and shortly afterwards made a memorable appearance on BBC television. Despite this promising start, biG GRunt dissolved during their first UK tour when Stanshall became incapacitated by the onset of an anxiety disorder that caused a nervous breakdown and would continue to plague him for the rest of his life.

However he soon recovered sufficiently to record and release, on the Liberty Records Liberty label, his first solo single "Labio-Dental Fricative/Paper Round" credited to Vivian Stanshall and The Sean Head Showband (an oblique reference to Stanshall having shaven off all of his hair during his breakdown), and featuring Eric Clapton on guitar. Later in the year his single version of Terry Staffords song "Suspicion (Terry Stafford song) Suspicion" credited to Vivian Stanshall and Gargantuan Chums, and featuring Keith Moon and John Entwistle of The Who, was released. Featured on the b-side was "Blind Date" the only officially released track by biG GRunt (however all of Stanshalls backing bands of 1970 featured the same core personnel, so it could be argued that theyre essentially the same band masquerading under a variety of names).

In early 1971 he returned to touring with a new band, Freaks. This group soon recorded a BBC radio session for John Peel that featured solo numbers by Stanshall and Neil Innes alongside tracks from the Bonzos yet to be recorded Lets Make Up And Be Friendly contractual obligation/reunion album of 1972. The session is also notable for marking the first appearance in any medium of an episode of Stanshalls magnum opus, Rawlinson End. Stanshall also found time during this period to be a founder member of the performance/poetry/music group Grimms alongside Innes, the members of The Scaffold and associated poets and musicians. Although Stanshall left Grimms before they made any recordings, he did continue to perform live with them on occasion.

Throughout this period, still suffering badly with anxiety and now drinking heavily to self-medicate, Stanshall nonetheless continued to write, record and tour with Freaks and then GRIMMS. He was also a regular guest, broadcaster and presenter on numerous shows on BBC Radio.

Despite his ongoing personal difficulties Stanshall never lost his sense of humour. His exploits with long-time drinking buddy Keith Moon, who would become Stanshalls regular partner in crime for much of the 1970s after producing and appearing on Stanshalls "Suspicion (Terry Stafford song) Suspicion" single, are legendary. In one example, Stanshall visited a tailors shop where he admired a pair of trousers. Moon then arrived, posing as another customer, and admired the same trousers, demanding to buy them. When Stanshall protested, the two men fought, splitting the trousers in two so that they ended up with one leg each. The tailor was understandably beside himself. Then, a one-legged actor hired by Stanshall and Moon would enter the scene, see the split trousers and proclaim: "Ah! Just what I was looking for! Ill buy them!"<ref>William Donaldson, Brewers Rogues, Villains & Eccentrics, 2002.</ref>

Thanks to his association with John Peel, in 1971 Stanshall was asked to fill in for the DJ while he was on a months holiday. The resulting short series, entitled Vivian Stanshalls Radio Flashes, was recorded under the supervision of Peels regular producer John Walters (broadcaster) John Walters and broadcast on BBC Radio One in August 1971. The series of four two-hour shows were a mix of music and specially written and recorded comedic sketches. Out of the original four episodes, only episodes 2, 3 and 4 remain in the BBC archives and these were re-broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2014, and again in 2016.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04cfgn1 title=Vivian Stanshalls Radio Flashes website=Bbc.co.uk accessdate=9 December 2017}}</ref> However, all four episodes and a Christmas 1971 compilation special have circulated among collectors as low-quality, edited off-air recordings since the 1970s. Contributors to the sketches in "Radio Flashes" included Keith Moon, Traffic (band) Traffics Jim Capaldi and actress Chris Bowler. The sketches included a four part serial adventure titled "Breath From The Pit", featuring the surreal exploits of a Dick Barton or Bulldog Drummond-style gentleman adventurer, Colonel Knutt (played by Stanshall) and his working-class sidekick, the likeable cheeky cockney, Lemmy. The serial was also in part a parody of Charles Chiltons Journey into Space, with Keith Moon playing the role of Lemmy.

==Rawlinson End==
Stanshall had developed what many consider to be his seminal work, Rawlinson End, as a spoken word performance piece during the first few years of the 1970s, recording an early version as part of the Bonzo Dog Bands Lets Make Up And Be Friendly reunion project. Beginning in 1975 he expanded upon the concept as an episodic surrealist radio serial for BBC Radio 1s John Peel show, elaborating further upon the weird and wonderful adventures of the inebriated and Colonel Blimp blimpish Sir Henry Rawlinson, his dotty wife Great Aunt Florrie, his "unusual" brother Hubert, old Scrotum the wrinkled Bastard feudalism retainer, Mrs E, the rambling and unhygienic cook; and many other inhabitants of the crumbling Rawlinson End and its environs.

Stanshall had been playing around with the Rawlinson characters for some time, and they were first referred to on the Bonzos 1967 number, "The Intro and the Outro": "Great to hear the Rawlinsons on trombone".

In 1978 he released an Gramophone record LP, Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (recording) Sir Henry at Rawlinson End, which reworked some material from the Peel sessions. This in turn was adapted into a Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (film) film version in 1980 which was produced in a sepia-tinted black and white. It starred Trevor Howard as Sir Henry, and Stanshall as Hubert.<ref>{{cite web url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6bf37864 title=Sir Henry at Rawlinson End work=BFI}}</ref> Some of the films music was provided in collaboration with Stanshalls friend Steve Winwood. A book of the same title by Stanshall, illustrated with stills from the film, was published by Eel Pie Publishing in 1980. Nominally a film novelisation, it was distilled from the various versions and included considerable material that did not make it to the film. A projected second book, The Eating at Rawlinson End, was never completed.

A second Rawlinson album, Sir Henry at Ndidi’s Kraal (1984), recounts Sir Henrys disastrous African expedition, omitting the rest of the Rawlinson clan. Stanshall at the time was living on The Searchlight, a house boat he bought from Denny Laine and kept moored near Shepperton on the River Thames. He lived on The Searchlight from 1977 to 1983 and recorded and produced the latest Sir Henry album on it during a period of debilitating physical illness. The album was disowned by Stanshall after its release, as he claimed it was both unfinished and unsatisfactory, and that the record label had rush-released it without his permission in an attempt to profit from his potentially imminent demise.{{citation needed date=January 2015}}

The noticeably superior BBC radio broadcasts continued however, sporadically, until late 1991. In the same year a temporarily rejuvenated Stanshall embarked upon a nationwide concert tour, entitled Rawlinson Dog Ends, with support from former Bonzos and centred around a performance of new Rawlinson End material.

"Sir Henry" was last seen in a television commercial for Ruddles Brewery Ruddles Real Ale (c. 1994), where he is portrayed by a transvestism cross-dressing Dawn French, presiding over a family banquet at a long table. Stanshall himself reprises the role of Hubert, reciting a poem loosely based on Edward Lears "The Owl and the Pussycat."{{citation needed date=September 2014}}

During this same period Stanshall embarked upon the recording of a proposed new Rawlinson End album, but this activity was curtailed in its early stages by its creators untimely death in March 1995.

After Stanshalls death, BBC Radio 4 retrieved some of the original Peel show recordings from the vaults for late-night repeat over Christmas 1996.

==1970s==

Stanshall regularly performed live with Grimms, as well as occasionally working with The Alberts and The Temperance Seven during the first few years of the decade. He was also a frequent contributor to BBC radio at this time, appearing weekly on Start The Week and Jack de Manio Precisely, and also on the BBC TV satire show Up Sunday.

In 1973 Stanshall recorded tracks for the soundtrack album of the movie Thatll Be the Day (film) backed by Keith Moon, Ronnie Wood, Graham Bond and Jack Bruce, and collaborated on numerous musical projects, making a memorable appearance as the Master Of Ceremonies on Mike Oldfields 1973 Tubular Bells, where he played the Master of Ceremonies (he reprised the role for Tubular Bells II in 1992, but the final release featured Alan Rickman instead). He guested on a number of other artists recordings including John Entwistles Smash Your Head Against the Wall Smash Your Head Against The Wall in 1971, Mike Hart (singer/songwriter) Mike Harts Basher, Chalky, Pongo and Me in 1972, Pete Browns The Not Forgotten Association in 1973, and Robert Calverts 1974 concept album Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters.

In early 1974, Stanshall wrote, arranged, and quickly recorded his first solo album, Men Opening Umbrellas Ahead. A rather more serious work than many would have expected, its darkly comic lyrics detailed Stanshalls alcoholism and troubled emotional state, laced with surreal poetic imagery and literary reference. Other lyrics included implicit references to other musicians and the music business, and a rather more explicit satire of the authors relationship with his own penis. Musically, while certain tracks display Stanshalls usual keen sense of rock and roll parody, most of the album has a tribal or fusion flavour. Prominently featuring the Nigerian musician Gasper Lawal and with many tracks infused with richly textured African percussion and chorus vocal stylings, the album (and its contemporary single "Lakonga") can justifiably lay claim to being an early, unheralded example of world music/rock music crossover. Stanshalls long-standing friends and colleagues Neil Innes, Anthony Bubs White, Traffic (band) Traffics Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, Ric Grech and Rebop Kwaku Baah, and Doris Troy and Madeline Bell also make notable guest appearances. Deleted after its first pressing and out of print for many years, the album was finally officially re-released on CD in 2012.

The BBC documentary One Mans Week, broadcast on 9 April 1975, documented a week in Stanshalls life and included footage of him at The Manor Studio The Manor recording studio during the Men Opening Umbrellas Ahead sessions, where he played with Anthony Bubs White, Gasper Lawal, Mongezi Feza, and Derek (or Deryk) Quinn.

In 1975 Stanshall provided the narration for a rock music version of Peter and the Wolf, produced by Robin Lumley and Jack Lancaster and featuring, among others, Gary Moore, Manfred Mann, Phil Collins, Bill Bruford, Stéphane Grappelli, Alvin Lee, Cozy Powell, Brian Eno and Jon Hiseman.<ref>{{cite web title=Various – Peter And The Wolf url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Peter-And-The-Wolf/release/2672908 website=Discogs accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref> And 1976 saw the release of his The Young Ones single, where the old Cliff Richard standard was delivered in the style of Boris Karloff.

In 1977, Stanshall and his companion, Pamela Ki Longfellow, moved into a house-boat, The Searchlight, moored on the Thames between Chertsey and Shepperton. During this period, Stanshall compiled and re-recorded material from his popular Radio BBC Radio 1 broadcasts for John Peel which was released as Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (recording) Sir Henry at Rawlinson End in 1978. He subsequently also wrote the script for the film adaptation of the same name, later produced for Tony Stratton-Smiths Charisma Records company in 1980.

==1980s==
{{main Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera}}
File:Vivwork2.jpg thumb right 200px Stanshall painting the doors into the hold of The Thekla
Following Sir Henry, Stanshall wrote the songs for his third album Teddy Boys Dont Knit (1981) (which included two songs about his family) and contributed a lyric to Steve Winwoods Arc of a Diver. He and Longfellow married in 1980 and together they wrote some of the songs they later used for Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera (a musical comedy). The houseboat The Searchlight eventually sank.

In 1982, Stanshall provided a spoken word segment on "Lovely Money", a single by The Damned (band) The Damned.

The Stanshalls lived and worked on The Thekla, a Baltic Trader, which Ki sailed 732 nautical miles (1,356&nbsp;km) from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear Sunderland to be moored in the Bristol Harbour Bristol Docks. Ki had bought the vessel and converted her into a floating theatre called "The Old Profanity Showboat". Stanshall joined her on it in 1983, when they opened the doors of the theatre. By this time he was already suffering from alcohol and drug abuse, having become addicted to Valium while trying to control his anxiety.

In December 1985, the Old Profanity Showboat produced the debut of their Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera. Stanshall wrote 27 original songs for the opera, sharing book and Lyrics lyric writing with his wife. The show has proved popular over the years. It was revived in London some years later with Peter Moss as musical director. It was produced in concert form in Bristol in July 2010.

Having returned to London alone in 1986 while his wife recovered from an illness, Stanshall saw Stinkfoot briefly, but unsuccessfully, revived at the Bloomsbury Theatre. After this he returned to the stage again, touring in a solo show "Rawlinson Dog-ends", initially with support from musicians including Jack Bruce. When Bruce quit, over a lack of adequate rehearsals, Moss stepped in to provide bass.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.vivarchive.org.uk/live.htm title=Vivians Live performances website=Vivarchive.org.uk deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808080911/http://www.vivarchive.org.uk/live.htm archivedate=8 August 2015 df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Marriage and family==
Stanshall was married in 1968 to fellow art student Monica Peiser (their son Rupert was born that year). They divorced in 1975.

File:Ki_Vivian.jpg thumb right 200px Vivian Stanshall and Ki Longfellow Ki Longfellow-Stanshall in the hold of The Thekla
On 9 September 1980, Stanshall married Ki Longfellow Pamela Ki Longfellow, an American writer who had a daughter from an earlier relationship.  The Stanshalls had a daughter, Silky, born the year before they married, on 16 August 1979. She was named after Silky Sullivan, a racehorse that was a childhood favourite of her mother. Stanshall celebrated Silkys birth in "The Tube", and his marriage to Ki in the song, "Bewilderbeeste", both included on his third solo album, Teddy Boys Dont Knit (1981). He later gave his wife the name of "Ki" from a dream. Even though their comic opera Stinkfoot was a success in late 1985, Stanshall returned alone to London after the turn of the year while Longfellow recuperated from an illness brought on by overwork and stress. Once Ki was well again, the Stanshalls lived out the rest of their tumultuous marriage until his sudden death in March 1995. At this point they were both planning on living together in Hampstead, London.<ref name="Book official website">{{cite web  url=http://www.theillustratedvivianstanshall.com/buy.php/tag/tag/ki-longfellow/  title=theillustratedvivianstanshall  author=  date=  accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref>{{better source needed date=February 2018}}

Years later Longfellow wrote The Illustrated Vivian Stanshall, a Fairytale of Grimm Art detailing Vivians life and work from 1977 to 1995.<ref name="Book official website"/>

==Memoirs==
In 1991 Stanshall made a 15-minute autobiographical piece called Vivian Stanshall: The Early Years, aka Crank, for BBC Two BBC2s The Late Show. He confessed to having been terrified of his father, who he said had always disapproved of him. His last television appearance, on The Late Show, was on 27 November 1991.

A programme for BBC Radio 4, Vivian Stanshall: Essex Teenager to Renaissance Man (1994) included an interview with his mother. She insisted his father had loved him. Stanshall said on the same programme that his father had never shown it, not even on his deathbed.

==Death==
Stanshall was found dead on the morning of 6 March 1995, after an electrical fire had broken out as he slept in his top floor flat in Muswell Hill, North London.<ref name="RandallWelch2010">{{cite book author1=Lucian Randall author2=Chris Welch title=Ginger Geezer: The Life of Vivian Stanshall page=317 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EqUw21XDfykC accessdate=10 September 2012 date=10 June 2010 publisher=HarperCollins UK isbn=978-0-00-738724-3}}</ref>  His private funeral service was held at the Golders Green Crematorium,  North London. A few days later his memorial service was held at St Patricks Church, Soho Square.

A memorial plaque was unveiled in the Poets Corner of Golders Green Crematorium on 13 December 2015, opposite that of his friend Keith Moon, by his widow Ki Longfellow-Stanshall and his daughter Silky Longfellow-Stanshall.

==Legacy and honours==
Writing in The Independent after Stanshalls death, Chris Welch wrote: "Seen by some as a wild eccentric, and a powerful personality who could be both charming and intimidating, Stanshall was perhaps too large a figure even for the music business to handle. ... He needed a producer to channel his energies, but always wanted to remain his own boss, having suffered too many perceived indignities in his early experience of the music business."<ref name=welch>{{cite news url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary--vivian-stanshall-1610214.html title=OBITUARY : Vivian Stanshall work=The Independent}}</ref> He was described by Neil Innes as "a national treasure".<ref name="Originals"/>

In 2001 Welch and Lucian Randall wrote a biography entitled Ginger Geezer: The Life of Vivian Stanshall. Also in 2001 Jeremy Pascall and Stephen Fry produced a documentary about Stanshall for BBC Radio 4. Stephen Fry knew Stanshall quite well and, along with his personal thoughts, introduces a series of reminiscences. The show featured many clips from Stanshalls work. The recording includes one of Stanshalls last poems, entitled "With My Mouth Turned Down for the Night".

In 2003 Sea Urchin Editions published the script of the Stanshalls Stinkfoot: An English Comic Opera, with an introduction by his widow, Ki Longfellow-Stanshall.<ref>{{cite web url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Stinkfoot.html?id=9xtUOQAACAAJ title=Stinkfoot: An English Comic Opera first=Vivian last=Stanshall date=9 December 2017 publisher=Sea Urchin Editions accessdate=9 December 2017 via=Google Books}}</ref>

On 11 October 2011 the Blackpool Comedy Carpet, a large public artwork by Gordon Young (artist) Gordon Young, was unveiled in Blackpool on the towns seaside promenade. It is made of 300 slabs of granite that cover about 2200 square meters. Featuring catchphrases, jokes and names, it commemorates more than 1000 selected "influential" comics, most of whom have played Blackpool in the last hundred years. The project was commissioned by the Blackpool Council as part of its redevelopment plan, and it is one of the largest pieces of public art in the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.designboom.com/art/gordon-young-the-comedy-carpet-blackpool/ Gordon Young and Blackpool Council, "The Comedy Carpet"], Design Boom, 11 October 2011</ref> Stanshall is represented in the work by two quotes and his name.

In 2012, Poppydisc Records reissued both a vinyl and CD version of Men Opening Umbrellas Ahead, remastered with new liner notes from his widow and daughter.

In June 2010 the 1978 Sir Henry at Rawlinson End LP was re-imagined by Michael Livesley as a one-man show, in which he stars as the narrator and all characters, backed by a six piece band replicating the instrumentation of the original. The show won rave reviews, then premiered in London on 14 October 2011. The show drew praise from Neil Innes and Adrian Edmondson who were in the audience. On 25 March 2013, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Stanshalls birth, Livesley was joined by Innes, Rick Wakeman, Danny Thompson, Rodney Slater (musician) Rodney Slater, Sam Spoons, Vernon Dudley Bohay-Nowell, Larry Smith (musician) Legs Larry Smith and John Otway, to perform Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (recording) Sir Henry at Rawlinson End at the Bloomsbury Theatre.{{citation needed date=March 2013}}The event was organised by Livesley and Rupert Stanshall, Vivians son.{{citation needed date=March 2013}}

On January 26, 2018 Longfellows biography/memoir/free form art book detailing Vivians life was published. Filled with Vivians paintings, sketches, notes, letters, and private photographs, <ref name="Book official website"/>The Illustrated Vivian Stanshall, a Fairytale of Grimm Art (illustrated by the young illustrator and animator Ben Wickey) contains not only Longfellows impressions of the life and work of her husband of 18 years but the remembrances of many of his closest friends as well as Vivians private journals.
