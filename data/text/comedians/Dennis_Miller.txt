===Primary school===
Miller attended Saint Anne School, a Catholic elementary school.<ref name=Wood/> Millers personality during this period was not one of an innate performer but of a shy kid.<ref name=Finder>{{cite news title=Dennis Miller: Monday Night Live date=July 30, 2000 author=Chuck Finder url=http://old.post-gazette.com/sports_headlines/20000730miller4.asp}}</ref> Millers childhood pastimes included playing street football, backyard baseball, playing basketball at St. Annes and watching lots of television.<ref name=Finder/> At St. Annes Miller served as manager for the Catholic Youth Organization basketball team for boys 15 to 16 years-old.<ref name=Finder/> Millers first inspiration to pursue a comedy career came as a child when he was taken to see comedian Kelly Monteith at a Pittsburgh club. After the show Monteith was kind enough to answer the young Millers questions about being a comedian, leaving him thinking "Man, Im going to work hard at this; ...seems like fun."<ref name=Roe>{{cite news title=Hey, Cha Cha – Dennis Miller brings his snarky shtick to Austin author=Dale Roe work=American-Statesman url=http://www.mystatesman.com/lifestyles/hey-cha-cha-dennis-miller-brings-his-snarky-shtick-austin/9Wgthda6QHqbO7KqMJWtGL/}}</ref>

===High school===
Miller went on to Keystone Oaks High School.<ref name=Wood>{{cite web url=http://www.nationalreview.com/weekend/people/people-wood020202.shtml title=People: Peter Wood on Dennis Miller on NRO Weekend work=National Review accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref>
His two earliest childhood comedy heroes were Jonathan Winters and Tim Conway.<ref>{{cite interview last= Miller first=Dennis interviewer=Dennis Miller title=The Dennis Miller Show last2=Conway first2=Tim url=http://www.dennismillerradio.com/blog?action=blogArchive&blogTag=Tim%20Conway date=2013-11-01}}</ref> By high school he had already developed a reputation for humor.<ref name=Finder/> Miller and his brother Rich had an open invitation to the home of his best friend Ted Wasik. The Wasik parents, Pauline and Ted "Herc" Wasik, Sr., treated Miller as one of their own. Pauline later recalled that Miller would often stage his comedy during a meal, which irritated her husband because the laughter distracted the rest of the children from eating.<ref name=Finder/> At Keystone Oaks, Miller was a member of the Physical Fitness Club, and in his senior year he worked on the Keynote newspaper and served on student council (he lost his bid for senior-class president to Richard Yount).<ref name=Finder/> During his senior year, he also served as co-master of ceremonies for the Keystone Oaks May Pageant, themed "Once Upon A Rumble Seat."<ref name=Finder/> Despite Millers reputation for humor, his actual personality at this time was one that was reserved, lacking self-confidence, and hidden under a layer of comedy.<ref name=Finder/> He graduated from high school in 1971 with the intent of studying to become a sports writer.<ref name=Wood/><ref name=Finder/>

===University===
At Point Park University Miller became a member of Sigma Tau Gamma fraternity.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.baylorsigtau.com/page.php?page_id=4056  title=Welcome to Sigma Tau Gamma, Gamma Omega Chapter  publisher=Baylorsigtau.com accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> Miller likened his social status at this period as being lower than Curtis Armstrong Booger of Revenge of the Nerds.<ref>{{cite book title=I Rant, Therefore I Am author=Dennis Miller publisher=Doubleday date=2000 page=126}}</ref>

Inspired by the film All the Presidents Men (film) All the Presidents Men, Miller majored in journalism. In the fall of his senior year at the university, Miller began writing for the South Hills Record, mixing humor into his sports reporting. When the paper changed its payment structure to pay around an eighth of a penny per column inch, Miller quit.<ref name=Finder/> Miller graduated from Point Park in 1976 with a degree in journalism.<ref name="TVG bio">{{cite web title=Dennis Miller Biography url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/dennis-miller/bio/147096 work=TV Guide accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Finder/> Miller would later reflect on why he did not continue to pursue journalism, saying "Im just not that interested in other peoples business and thats a tragic flaw in a journalist."<ref name=Tulsa/>

===Career search===
After college, Miller was unable to find work in journalism. Instead, he moved through several occupations, including a clerk at Giant Eagle deli, a janitor, a delivery man for a florist, and an ice cream scooper at the Village Dairy.<ref name=Finder/> Reflecting on his pre-comedy job history in a later discussion with Tom Snyder, Miller recalled leaving college and attending a real estate seminar at a "bad hotel," which consisted of a five-hour lecture without bathroom breaks. Near the end of the lecture, he was told that he would only be paid by commission, which made Miller say "Im in Hell, I dont even know what I am going to do for a living here. Im a nut case." Miller then worked as a delivery man for what he describes as "an all-gay florist." Leaving that job, he worked as an ice cream scooper. Miller recalled that he was twenty-one—five years out of high school and wearing a paper hat while working alongside teens excited about getting their drivers licenses. A spur to quit the ice cream scooping job was when the prettiest girl he had attended high school with came in and he was the one who had to take her order, which filled him with embarrassment.<ref name=Tom>{{cite video title=1995-Dennis Miller publisher=The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWAyOAz2xkU date=July 28, 1995}}</ref> Miller later stated that at the time he feared that if he stayed in such jobs, his life would become a Franz Kafka novella, and it stiffened his resolve to start pursuing a comedy career.<ref name=Joke/>

Leaving the ice cream parlor, Miller joined the staff at Point Parks Recreation Room, where he was in charge of the bowling alley, video games, and running the air-hockey league.<ref name=Finder/> Air-hockey regulars nicknamed him "Clarence" after NHL Commissioner Clarence Campbell, or called him "Commish." When Millers brother Jimmy was around, they referred to him as "Commush".<ref name=Finder/> A patron from that time recalled that Miller sat on pool tables telling jokes and honing his comedy to those in the rec room, which was the only place the commuters gathered. Miller and the other patrons closely followed the NFL at the time as it was the "Pittsburgh Steelers#The Chuck Noll era era of the Super Steelers".<ref name=Finder/>

===Beginning stand-up===
In 1979 after seeing a Robin Williams comedy special on HBO, Miller decided that he had to pursue his dream of being a stand-up comedian.<ref name=Finder/>

In Pittsburgh Miller began pursuing a comedy career by performing at open-mic nights. He backed out of his first two attempts to perform at an open mic due to stage fright and anger with himself over the question of whether the drive to perform was a need for approval from others.<ref name=Duncan>{{cite news work=Los Angeles Times date=June 11, 1989 author=Duncan Strauss title=Hes Brainy, Funny--and Frightened? url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-11/entertainment/ca-3378_1_stand-up-fresh-air-real-life}}</ref> When he finally made his début at the Oaks Lounge on Sleepy Hollow Road in Castle Shannon, most of Millers family was in the audience to cheer him on.<ref name=Julina>{{cite news title=Comic Killing Em With Gags author=Mike Julina date=February 23, 1980 work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette page=12 url=
https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/88936157/}}</ref>

In a later interview, Miller spoke of the stage presence he developed for his stand-up act to address his fears. (He emphasized that the comedy business will always be frightening as any error could spiral into the end of a career.) To compensate for his early fears, Miller said, "I got up there and acted like the guy I always wanted to be to get through it. ...Its a part of me, but its not the real me." He would keep his hands in his pockets to appear unfazed, or adjust his cuffs during an audience laugh to give the appearance of indifference to approval. Miller pointed out that part of his act is to show a "hipper-than-thou" persona, but then purposely undermine it at regular intervals for comedic effect.<ref name=Duncan/>

He began appearing onstage at the Oaks Lounge in Castle Shannon while working at the Giant Eagle deli in Kennedy Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Kennedy.<ref name=Finder/> Miller lived without a car and without much money in the Oakland (Pittsburgh) Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, hitching rides or taking buses.<ref name=Finder/> He continued to do stand-ups in Oakland and at places like Brandys in the Strip District and the Portfolio on Craig Street, eventually saving up $1,000 which he used to try to fast-track his comedy career by moving to New York City.<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Julina/> Arriving there, Miller had to bribe a landlord $200 to give him a room, then had to pay the security deposit of $250 and the first months rent of $250, resulting in his having spent $700 of his $1,000 savings the first day for a sparse, bunker-like room.<ref name=Julina/>

While in New York he submitted a joke for a Playboy magazine contest for humor writing that was judged by an all-star panel including Rodney Dangerfield, Bill Cosby, David Brenner, Martin Mull, Art Buchwald, and Buck Henry.<ref name=Julina/> Of around 15,000 entries, Miller tied for second and his joke and picture appeared in the June 1979 issue of the magazine.<ref name=Duncan/><ref name=Julina/> Miller won $500 as a runner-up in Playboy{{}}s first annual humor competition with the following joke:
{{quote The only difference between group sex and group therapy is that in group therapy you hear about everyones problems, and in group sex you see them. Dennis Miller Playboy, June 1979<ref>{{cite news date=June 1979 title=Funny Money magazine=Playboy volume=26 number=6 issn=0032-1478}}</ref>}}

For the first year and a half of his comedy career, Miller had heavily relied on props during his act, but he felt this limited him and switched to using purely language.<ref name=Duncan/>

Miller gained more exposure when he tried out for the New York Laff-Off Contest. The contest had 40 slots but 32 of them had already been filled by the top regulars who appeared at the three comedy venues sponsoring the competition. 350 people tried out for the remaining eight slots, some of whom had appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, The Merv Griffin Show, or The Mike Douglas Show. Many of the comedians Miller was up against had hours of crafted material, while he had fine-tuned around ten minutes. To his surprise and delight, Miller earned one of the remaining slots. For the competition itself he appeared at the Improv and received a standing ovation, moving him onto the finals. While he did not win the Laff-Off, he was seen by dozens of talent agents, resulting in bookings at colleges and other clubs.<ref name=Julina/>

While he was working in New York City, Hustler Magazine listed Miller in a piece called "The 10 Funniest People in America Youll Never See on TV."<ref name=Julina/>

While in New York City, Miller supported himself by working rather mundane jobs during the day, such as bartender and payroll clerk, and by night made the rounds of New York clubs The Comic Strip, The Improvisation, and Catch a Rising Star.<ref name=Julina/> After about a year, unable to make a go of it, he returned to Pittsburgh.<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Duncan/>

==Television career==
Having honed his stand-up comedy act, Miller was able to transition to television, increasing his audience base.

===KDKA-TV===
Having gone through the comedy-club circuit, Miller returned to do his sight-gag routine back in Pittsburgh at Brandys in August 1980. It was there that local television station KDKA-TV was shooting a piece for its Evening Magazine and offered him a job at the station. By the end of 1980 Miller acted as a warm-up in the afternoons for KDKAs Pittsburgh 2Day. He then began starring in humorous segments for the syndicated Evening Magazine. By 1983 he had become the host of Punchline, a Saturday-morning newsmagazine aimed at teenagers. In one episode he interviewed fellow comedian Pat Paulsen. Miller later reflected on this time, saying that "you have to start somewhere", and that he was "just pleased to be in front of a camera."<ref name=Finder/><ref>{{cite web author=The Comedy Zone Humor Network  url=http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/m/miller-dennis.htm  title=Dennis Miller : Comedian Profile  publisher=Comedy-zone.net  accessdate=2010-10-07  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612030529/http://comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/m/miller-dennis.htm  archivedate=June 12, 2010 }}</ref>

During this time Miller also performed stand-up in New York City comedy clubs such as Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs) Catch A Rising Star and The Comic Strip. While in New York, Miller saw a show by Richard Belzer and noted how he barked at the crowd rather than embraced it, was cutting rather than cute. Miller adopted this comedic philosophy.<ref name=Finder/>

During performances at comedy clubs in Pittsburgh, Miller befriended Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld. In 1984 Leno found Miller an apartment in Los Angeles and he and Seinfeld arranged a début for Miller at The Improv.<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Joke/> Miller resigned from KDKA and moved to Los Angeles to try to further his comedy career.

Millers brothers Rich and Jimmy joined him in Los Angeles, taking up varied jobs around The Improv such as booking shows, acting as bouncer, and selling tickets. Jimmy would go on to become a power talent agent with Gold Miller, and Rich would run RCM Entertainment, booking comedians across the country.<ref name=Finder/>

In Los Angeles, Leno was a big influence on Miller as he was to many upcoming comedians in the area at the time. Young comedians would gather at Lenos home late at night and he would offer critiques with humorous, biting wit. Leno would also tape television appearances of his group and show them during such sessions while offering more humorous critiques. Miller would later fondly recall the time, saying it was like "sitting at his knee, querying Yoda".<ref name=Finder/>

Miller appeared on Star Search, where he lost out to fellow comedian Sinbad (comedian) Sinbad after the two tied with judges scores, but Sinbad won with a higher studio-audience approval rating. Miller made his first appearance on Late Night with David Letterman on June 24, 1985 (other guests that night were Phil Collins and María Conchita Alonso).<ref name=Joke/><ref>{{cite web publisher=epguides.com url=http://epguides.com/LateNightwithDavidLetterman/ title=Late Night with David Letterman (a Guest Stars & Air Dates Guide)}}</ref>

===Saturday Night Live===
Millers big break came in 1985 when he was discovered by Lorne Michaels at The Comedy Store. Michaels had him come in for an audition. Miller did an audition in L.A. for SNL and that went well enough for him to be brought to New York for a second audition in a room in Times Square. About 70 people watched this second audition—this was most of the shows staff along with Lorne Michaels, Paul Simon, and Dan Aykroyd. Miller walked into a well-lit room and was told "Go ahead, you have eight minutes, Dennis."<ref name=Roe/> After the New York audition he went to dinner with Michaels and Jack Nicholson. Miller felt that this was just another aspect of his audition, to see if he could handle himself around famous people, so he "just sat there quietly".<ref name=Roe/>

Miller later recalled the conclusion of the meeting with Michaels: "He looked at me and goes, Would you like to do my newscast?. And I said, Yeah, I would, and he said, Well, Ill see you tomorrow. And then I walked out. And I remember thinking, My life has just changed."<ref name=Joke/> Miller had landed a spot on Saturday Night Live, where he succeeded Christopher Guest as the Weekend Update anchor. The spot was supposed to go to comic Jon Lovitz, but Lovitz was scheduled for other parts on the show and needed the Update segment to do costume changes, so Miller was drafted to read the news.<ref name="penn">{{cite episode title=Penn Jillette Radio Show.

Miller began his fictional news reports with "Good evening, and what can I tell you?" and closed with "Guess what, folks?  Thats the news, and I am outta here!". Fans of SNL became accustomed to his snarky delivery, high-pitched giggle, and frequently primped hair—idiosyncrasies that would be spoofed by Dana Carvey, Tom Hanks, and Jimmy Fallon, all of whom have impersonated Miller on the show. When Miller left SNL in 1991, the anchors chair was turned over to Kevin Nealon.

In 1988, Miller released a stand-up comedy CD, The Off-White Album, derived from an HBO special titled Mr. Miller Goes to Washington,<ref>{{IMDb title 0249466 Mr. Miller Goes to Washington Starring Dennis Miller (1988) }}</ref> which drew heavily from the Observational comedy observational and metaphor-driven style he was known for on Saturday Night Live, and showed glimpses of the political humor that would influence his later work. A well-received HBO special, Dennis Miller: Black and White,<ref>{{IMDb title 0317340 Dennis Miller: Black and White, (1990)}}</ref> aired shortly after the release of the CD.

Although Miller spent much of his time on SNL behind the Weekend Update desk, he was included in some sketches and did a few recurring characters and celebrity impersonations.<ref name="snl archives">[http://snl.jt.org/cast.php?i=DeMi Dennis Miller], SNL Archives</ref>

====Recurring characters====
* Koko, one of the pixies in the recurring sketch "Miss Connies Fable Nook"
* Steve, one of The Stand-Ups (others include Jon Lovitz as Bob, Damon Wayans as Keith, and Tom Hanks as Paul)

====Celebrity impersonations====
* Gary Hart
* George Harrison
* Nathaniel Crosby

===The Dennis Miller Show===
In 1992, after leaving SNL, Miller hosted an eponymous late-night talk show in Broadcast syndication syndication that lasted seven months.

====Late-night landscape====
The Arsenio Hall Show was launched in 1989, and after Tribune Entertainment saw how that show brought in new and younger viewers to late night, they wanted to make their own show in an attempt to match its success.<ref name=Phil>{{cite news title=Talk With A tude date=January 20, 1992 author=Phil Rosenthal work=Los Angeles Daily News url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-01-20/lifestyle/9201181129_1_dennis-miller-miller-show-miller-brings}}</ref> In 1990 Tribune Entertainment pursued Garry Shandling to create a syndicated late-night talk show, reaching out to him through the talent agency that represented him Brillstein Entertainment Partners Brillstein-Grey Entertainment. When Shandling turned down the offer, Brillsten-Grey recommended Miller, who was another of their clients.<ref>{{cite news title=Shandling finds the grass still greener on his side of the talk-show fence date=June 1, 1993 author=David Zurawik work=Baltimore Sun url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-06-01/features/1993152130_1_garry-shandling-larry-sanders-show-talk-show}}</ref><ref name=Phil/> The drive for Tribune to come out with a new show increased when in May 1991 Johnny Carson announced he would be retiring. As it became apparent that Jay Leno would take Carsons place and as the time slot was at that point only contested by The Arsenio Hall Show, Tribune felt that if Leno could not hold onto Carsons fans they might migrate to a newer show.<ref name=Carman>{{cite news title=Weeknight update: Dennis Miller debuts date=January 20, 1992 author=John Carman work=The Baltimore Sun url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-01-20/features/1992020185_1_dennis-miller-arsenio-hall-miller-show}}</ref> Miller was approached with an offer where Tribune Entertainment would distribute the show and Miller would co-produce the show with Brillstein-Grey Company.<ref name=Allan>{{cite news date=January 19, 1992 author=Allan Johnson work=Chicago Tribune url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-01-19/entertainment/9201060005_1_dennis-miller-show-weekend-update-studio-audience title=Dennis Thinks Its Miller Time on Talk Show Circuit}}</ref> Miller and the others involved felt even more secure in their position when Leno was picked to replace Carson over David Letterman, who it was thought would renew his contract with NBC till at least 1993. It was believed that fans of Letterman would naturally be interested in Millers show and prefer that over Lenos in that time slot.<ref name=Phil/>

====Leaving SNL====
Miller decided he was going to leave SNL after the 1990-91 season despite being happy with his role on the show and despite loving writing political gags for it, because he had turned 38 and his 18-month-old son Holden had made him want to strive for things to "make the boy proud."<ref name=Allan/><ref name=Adams/> He told an interviewer, "I had a great gig and this came up. It seemed like an opportunity that doesnt present itself too frequently in your life, so I opted to take it. ...I wanted to see what other talents I had, so I decided this was the shot."<ref name=Adams/> Miller thought that his outspokenness behind the SNL desk on political topics and even on jokes not working out made the transition to talk show host a good idea. He also felt that the SNL studio audience never fully accepted him in skits as other characters, making him question his acting ability.<ref name=Allan/>

After it was announced that Miller would be starting his own show, he was a guest on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, who offered him some advice while reflecting on his own 30-year career from which he was retiring in May 1992. He told Miller to compete only with himself, not to focus on the competition. Miller appreciated the advice, noting that "theres no class for this" and that he would have to learn on the job in front of an audience.<ref name=Allan/> In preparation, Miller sharpened his interviewing skills by practicing on the shows stage hands.  He felt that the secret to interviewing well was listening to the guest rather than trying to set up jokes while the guest is talking.<ref name=Allan/>

As the date for the shows opening approached, Miller told an interviewer that he was both thrilled and "scared shitless" by the opportunity. He hoped to eventually be able to relax enough to be entirely himself. He saw Johnny Carsons approach as the standard but hoped not to be too influenced by anyone.<ref name=Adams/> Between SNL and his new show, Miller did stand-up dates with Howie Mandel and then with Steven Wright.<ref name=Adams/>

====The shows early days====
In support of the shows premiere, Tribune made use of extensive advertising in trade publications and on-air promotions and also did a billboard promotion on Sunset Boulevard.<ref name=Hastings/>

On January 20, 1992, following his departure from Saturday Night Live, Miller launched the late-night TV talk show, The Dennis Miller Show, syndicated by Tribune Entertainment. The Dennis Miller Show continued in the tradition of "Alternative culture alternative" talk shows, starting with the Late Night with David Letterman show, which debuted on NBC in 1982. Nick Bakay was the announcer, and Andy Summers, formerly of the band The Police, led the house band.

Guests included Mountain (band) Mountain (with Leslie West and Corky Laing), Toad the Wet Sprocket (who made their national television debut on the show), Henry Rollins (who appeared repeatedly to chat with Miller and perform spoken word), Primus (band) Primus (who while performing "Tommy the Cat", had to deal with a member of the audience who jumped onstage—whom Miller playfully tried to "tackle"), Kings X (who performed two songs, "Black Flag (song) Black Flag" and "Its Love" to empty seats in the studio due to the 1992 Los Angeles riots), and comedian Bill Hicks.

The show remained faithful to the classic talk-show format with a desk and three or four guests a night, while Miller carried forward the spirit of his SNL Weekend Update with a newscast segment that aired on Fridays.<ref name=Adams/><ref name=Allan/>

The shows staff boasted a mix of past and future performers, writers, and producers of note including Mark Brazill (That 70s Show), Eddie Feldmann, David Kohan and Max Mutchnick (creators of Will & Grace), Norm Macdonald, Bob Odenkirk (Mr. Show), John Riggi, Kevin Rooney, Herb Sargent (Saturday Night Live), Drake Sather, and Dave Thomas (actor) Dave Thomas (Second City TV).

Miller thought there would be room for his show as its main competitors for the time slot would be The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and The Arsenio Hall Show and he felt they all attracted different audiences.<ref name=Allan/> At the time Arsenio Hall was not worried about Jay Lenos hold on late night, but told the Los Angeles Times, "Dennis Miller is the only one who scares me, because I have tremendous respect for him and think hes one of the brightest comics on the scene."<ref name=Phil/><ref>{{cite news title=The Arsenio Way : No Carson Copycat, Hall Woofs Up His Audience By Making His Own Rules date=January 5, 1992 author=Dabuek Cerone work=Los Angeles Times url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-05/news/tv-2136_1_arsenio-hall}}</ref>

The show opened to mixed reviews, with some being "blisteringly negative", but Tribune remained optimistic, saying that a 2 rating nationally would be acceptable due to the late hour of the show and pointed out that in some places Miller was doing better than Hall.<ref>{{cite news title=Reporters Notebook author=Bill Carter date=February 4, 1992 url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/04/arts/reporter-s-notebook-rather-pulls-cbs-news-back-to-the-assassination.html work=New York Times}}</ref> As the show progressed, national ratings were still behind Hall (whose show was also syndicated). In the first five weeks of Millers show, the national A.C. Nielsen Co. rating was 1.8 (around 1.6&nbsp;million homes) to Halls 3.4 over the same time-period.<ref name=Cerone/> Media watchers noted that, in contrast, Halls 1989 debut had numbers between 3 and 3.5 and that the industry standard for long-term survival at the time was a minimum of 2.<ref name=Cerone/> In order to address this shortfall and in anticipation of Carson leaving and his audience being up for grabs, Tribune began making changes.<ref name=Cerone/> In February 1992, Andy Summers announced that since helping to launch the show and writing its theme music, he should move on to focus instead on his solo career.<ref>{{cite news title=Television date=February 19, 1992 work=Los Angeles Times url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-19/entertainment/ca-2164_1_dennis-miller-show}}</ref> Summers had developed a different musical vision for the show than the traditional rock n roll that Tribune wanted.

Media watchers noted that Tribune had lowered its ad prices since failing to live up to its original ratings estimates.<ref name=Cerone/> Tribune insisted that "We dont think of our shows in terms of some kind of death period," and pointed out that it took two years for The Joan Rivers Show, then in its fourth year, to get off the ground.<ref name=Cerone/>

===="The Booking Wars"====
To differentiate himself from Arsenio, Miller wanted to have a mix of Hollywood celebrities, authors, and political figures on the show, early on having guests like Larry Miller (comedian) Larry Miller, Sally Kirkland, Clive Barker, Michael Kinsley, Tom Hanks, Christian Slater, Bonnie Raitt, Al Gore, and Benjamin Netanyahu.<ref name=Phil/>

A few weeks in, the show began encountering problems booking guests, with some media outlets such as the Dallas Morning News wondering if it was Millers interview style, where "Miller messes around with them as best he can, looking for openings to throw a jab or two or 10."<ref name=DMN/> In response Miller said he did not want to always be "a faceless, selfless conduit of information", he did not want to be another Larry King saying one or two words between guests speeches. Nor did he want to be like Arsenio Hall, who was seen as fawning over guests on his show. Miller felt he was attracting an audience that wanted a "different, funky vibe".<ref name=DMN/><ref name=Phil/><ref>{{cite news title=Tv Looks To Night Owls in Hopes of Golden Eggs date=August 12, 1991 author=Jonathan Storm work=Orlando Sentinel url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-08-12/lifestyle/9108100487_1_arsenio-ron-reagan-show-miller-show}}</ref>

Some controversy occurred around an episode involving guest performance artist Karen Finley. In her piece, she characterized abortion as pouring Drano into a womans vagina and said she wanted to "feminize the planet to overthrow this male control of our lives." Afterwards, Miller interviewed her and defended her right of expression. Tribune later pulled the episode from its scheduled July 14 air-time, then cut out her segment and aired the rest on July 17. Finley accused the show of censoring her. She told a reporter "I think Dennis Miller is just as bad as Jesse Helms. Whats the difference?". Tribune said that they had taken this action not for political reasons but "the inappropriateness of including the segment in a music, comedy and light-entertainment program".<ref>{{cite news date=July 16, 1992 work=Los Angeles Times author=Daniel Cerone url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-16/local/me-3724_1_performance-artist title=Performance Artist Charges Censorship}}</ref>

The main reason the show had problems booking guests was that Helen Kushnick, executive producer for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, let it be known that anyone appearing on a competing talk show would never be invited on Lenos program.<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Pierce>{{cite news title=Late-Night Talk-Show Battle has gotten a lot Tighter author=Scott D.

Miller, realizing upfront that his show would have trouble competing with more established late-night talk shows, told his shows talent booker not to attempt to compete for famous guests. Instead he wanted to go after "fringe players" and, invoking Gertrude Stein he said he wanted to set a mood of "an eclectic sense of Salon (gathering) salon."<ref name=Campus>{{cite video title=When Jay Leno Pissed Off Dennis Miller work=CampusInsiders date=October 15, 2015 url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wQgZ4JjUdY}}</ref> He later recalled that even this approach did not prevent problems with Lenos show.

====Cancellation & after-effects====
On July 17, 1992, Tribune Entertainment announced it was cancelling Millers show due to poor ratings. Donald Hacker, its president and chief executive officer, said "After a tremendous effort on the parts of all parties involved, weve made a business decision not to proceed." The last show would be July 24, 1992.<ref>{{cite news title=Comedian Is Outta Here - Millers Show Canceled date=July 18, 1992 url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-07-18/news/9207180853_1_tribune-entertainment-comedian-chicago-tribune}}</ref> Tribune issued an odd, single-spaced, five-page press release that praised the show, its ratings, its guests, and its segments (no mention was made of profits).<ref>{{cite news title=Front and Center date=July 19, 1992 author=Kathy OMalley work=Chicago Tribune url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-07-19/features/9203050129_1_illinois-rich-daley-bill-clinton}}</ref> Tribune also took out a two-page ad spread in the Hollywood Reporter, which thanked Miller and the guests of his show.<ref name=Hastings>{{cite news title=Save Miller Show calls top 150,000 author=Deborah Hastings agency=Associated Press url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19920804&id=B_xNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oIsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5122,643705&hl=en}}</ref> Despite Tribune Entertainment having promised Miller a nine-month commitment,<ref name=Phil/> the show was cancelled after seven months, with Tribune CEO saying the show wasnt making the ratings growth needed to continue.<ref>{{cite news authorlink=Daniel Cerone first=Daniel last=Cerone title=Tribune Cancels Nighttime Talk Show Dennis Miller url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-18/business/fi-3649_1_dennis-miller work=Los Angeles Times date=1992-07-18 accessdate=2014-02-02}}</ref>

Arsenio Hall, still angered by "The Booking Wars," reacted to the news of Millers cancellation by saying "He should be staying and punk-ass Leno should be going."<ref name=Harris/>

During the final week of Millers show, taped after the cancellation press release, he announced a 1-900 phone number for fans to call and ask for the show to be continued. The number received around 150,000 calls and the charge for calling it made between $40-$50,000, which was donated to the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Miller said he was touched by the outpouring and said he had only expected at most 20,000 calls.<ref name=Hastings/> Also during the final week, he took on a sharper edge that, to some reviewers, such as Phil Rosenthal, showed "just how much unfulfilled promise the show held for the same viewers who love NBCs Late Night With David Letterman or even Comedy Centrals cult favorite Night After Night with Allan Havey." He jokingly looked into the camera and begged CBS Entertainment president Jeff Sagansky for a job; he had Julia Sweeney appear as her androgynous SNL character Pat and serenade him mimicking Bette Midlers song for the retiring Johnny Carson. When a skit began to fail he moved the man with the cue-cards on camera.<ref name=Rosenthal/>

Miller also openly complained that getting guests had become increasingly difficult after Leno took over from Carson. He began openly accusing Lenos agent Helen Kushnick of unethical strong-arm booking tactics, which was a charge previously made by Arsenio Hall.<ref name=Abbott>{{cite news title=Dennis Millers Soft Side Starts To Compete With His Smugness date=November 5, 1992 author=Jim Abbott url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-11-05/lifestyle/9211040378_1_dennis-miller-miller-called-miller-found work=Orlando Sentinel}}</ref><ref name=Rosenthal/> Miller blasted Leno and Kushnicks press conference earlier that month that denied such tactics were being used.<ref name=Rosenthal/> After the cancellation Miller told an interviewer "I dont like Jay and The Tonight Show. We just had problems, and I dont like the way they do business. ... There are ways to book shows and be tactful about it. Arsenio is very classy about it. The other show is not very tactful about it."<ref>{{cite news title=Dennis Miller work=Lodi News-Sentinel date=September 4, 1992 url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19920904&id=za8zAAAAIBAJ&sjid=njIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=5172,578334&hl=en}}</ref> Elsewhere Miller said that while he had only met Hall twice, "Hes a legitimate human being who doesnt bullshit you." He called Hall classy and expressed interest at becoming better friends. In contrast, he said of Leno, "Jay and I were very good friends at one point. I don’t think Id talk to him again, nor would he want to talk to me."<ref name=Hastings/>

Reviewers held that along with problems with booking guests, Miller had a tough time reconciling his caustic stand-up comedian stage presence that savaged his targets with that of interviewer where he cozied up to his subjects—though he was getting better near the end.<ref name=Rosenthal/>

On Millers last show he, mimicking political party nomination races, said, "I release all my delegates to Arsenio and David Letterman." Miller then made an appearance on Halls show.<ref name=Harris/>

There was speculation about what Miller might do after the cancellation, with The Associated Press reporting that all four network television stations had approached his business manager after the cancellation.<ref name=Hastings/> Miller went back to stand-up comedy, performing at colleges and preparing for an HBO special. He told a reporter, "Part of me would like to do another [talk show], but the other side says, Who needs the headaches?". The competitive side of me wants to do another one, and I think something eventually will come up in TV."<ref name=Abbott/>

When Lenos ratings began to erode a few months into taking the Tonight Show from Carson, Miller told a reporter that he had always anticipated as much but now was not in a position to capitalize on it. He also expressed some anger at Tribune for pulling the plug by July rather than fulfilling its commitment to him which was at least until September (a promise they had repeated as late as May). He felt they had "a short fuse" and the company "wasnt a fan of me."<ref name=Abbott/><ref name=Rosenthal>{{cite news title=Millers Funky Charm Didnt Fly on Late Night date=July 29, 1992 author=Phil Rosenthal work=Orlando Sentinel url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-07-29/lifestyle/9207280770_1_dennis-miller-miller-show-tonight-show}}</ref> Elsewhere he said, "I think they flinched. If youre going to get in you got to get in and stay there for a while."<ref name=Hastings/>

Since Leno had taken over The Tonight Show the program had begun competing with Miller and Arsenio Hall for the same younger-skewing audiences and celebrity guests. The strong-arm booking practices of (Lenos longtime manager, producer, and close friend) Helen Kushnick for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno came to a head by September 15, 1992. Country artists Travis Tritt and Trisha Yearwood, both clients of talent manager Ken Kragen, had been dropped and banned from The Tonight Show because Kragen had refused to cancel an already-booked appearance for Tritt with Hall when Kushnick called.<ref name=Tritt>{{cite news title=Tonight Gives Tritt the Boot date=September 15, 1992 author=Daniel Cerone url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-15/entertainment/ca-742_1_travis-tritt work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> By September 28, 1992, NBC announced: "Effective immediately, Helen Kushnick will no longer be the executive producer [of The Tonight Show]." Leno protested the move and expressed his continued support, but having been told by NBC that either she goes or both she and he go, did not make any ultimatums. Tonight Show insiders said Kushnick didnt let Leno get involved in production or booking and lied to him if he asked questions about it, and the two of them "have this sick, twisted, Hitchcock mother-son thing going."<ref>{{cite news title=Goodbye Helen Kushnick author=Lisa Schwarzbaum date=October 2, 1992 work=Entertainment Weekly url=http://ew.com/article/1992/10/02/goodbye-helen-kushnick/}}</ref>

Miller, despite having been proven correct about his claims about Kushnick and The Tonight Show, expressed an air of resignation about the whole experience, telling a reporter in November 1992, "Everything that Arsenio and I were saying has been borne out to be true, but thats old news now."<ref name=Abbott/>

In 1993 when David Letterman left NBC for CBS, he was asked by Rolling Stone which comedian he thought might be able to take over the NBC slot. He thought that Dana Carvey might be good, but pointed to Miller for the time slot due to seeing him on The Dennis Miller Show before it was cancelled.<ref>{{cite news title=Letterman to Ex-bosses: Hire Dennis Miller for Show work=Orlando Sentinel date=January 29, 1993 url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-01-29/news/9301290574_1_dennis-miller-david-letterman-bosses}}</ref> (The network eventually chose Conan OBrien).

In 1994 Leno fired Kushnick, for among other things planting a story in the New York Post in 1991 that claimed NBC wanted Carson to retire so they could hire Leno and attract a younger audience and then lying to Leno that it wasnt she. In 1995, after the Kushnick firing, Miller called Leno and they apologized to each other. Miller told a reporter, "I just got fed up in private and decided to call Jay earlier this week, because life is too short."<ref>{{cite news title=With his feud with Jay Leno ended, Dennis Miller is a sort-of happy guy publisher=Knight Ridder Tribune date=May 12, 1995 url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16951198.html}}</ref> Having re-established their friendship, Miller appeared on The Tonight Show on May 10, 1995, and Leno appeared on HBOs Dennis Miller Live on May 12, 1995.<ref>{{cite news title=Jay Leno Another Feud is put to Rest date=May 6, 1995 work=Spartanburg Herald-Journal url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19950506&id=27YeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bM8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6047,890983&hl=en}}</ref> Miller would appear several times on Lenos show afterwards, even being one of the comedian stand-ins delivering Michael Jackson jokes when Jay Leno#Michael Jackson trial Leno was under a court-ordered gag order during the 2005 trial of Michael Jackson.<ref>{{cite news title=For Jay Leno, Michael Jackson Gags Are in Order author=Lisa de Moraes date=March 12, 2005 work=The Washington Post url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28632-2005Mar11.html}}</ref>

===Dennis Miller Live===
Beginning in 1994, Miller hosted Dennis Miller Live, a half-hour talk show on HBO. The shows theme song was the Tears for Fears hit "Everybody Wants to Rule the World", and included a snippet of the song "Civilized" by the Rollins Band.
The show was taped at CBS Television City on the same stage where The Price Is Right is taped. It utilized a small set and sparse lighting, and there was no band. It comprised mainly Miller, speaking to the largely-unseen studio audience, on a darkened stage.

Miller hosted one guest per show, with whom he would discuss the topic of the day. Early on, guests were all interviewed live via satellite, but soon most appeared live in the studio. There was also a call-in segment. The number was originally given as 1-800-LACTOSE. Later, he referred to it only by its numeric equivalent (1-800-522-8673). Within the time available, Miller typically could accommodate only two or three calls. He gradually eliminated call-ins in the last few seasons of the show.

Miller and his writing staff won five Emmy Awards during the shows run, which aired 215 episodes over nine years. HBO cancelled the show in 2002.

===Monday Night Football===
With the increasing popularity of cable television and its multiple channel and programming options, American Broadcasting Company ABCs Monday Night Football found itself competing for viewers.<ref name=SI/> One of its main competitors for its target young male demographic was professional wrestling. A further sense of urgency struck ABC when NBC announced that it would be working with WWE World Wrestling Federations Vince McMahon to usher in a competing football league in 2001—the XFL that would encourage rougher play and air during the offseason of the National Football League NFL.<ref name=SI/>

ABC went through a series of different announcer combinations in rapid succession, trying to establish a booth dynamic that would recapture the publics imagination.  By the close of the 1999 season, they were looking to make the fourth change in as many years.<ref name=SI/> By the end of the 1999 NFL season, Monday Night Football had its ratings decline for the fifth season in a row. Dropping from an average of 17.8% of U.S. televisions in 1994 to 13.7% by 1999. In an effort to turn things around, ABC fired Boomer Esiason who had been on the show for two years. They also convinced Don Ohlmeyer, who had produced the show in the 1970s, to come out of retirement and gave him the authority to pick his own announcers (he had also established NBCs successful Must See TV line-up before retiring).<ref name=SI/><ref name=Booth>{{cite news date=June 23, 2000 title=Dennis Miller, Fouts to Monday Night Football booth agency=Associated Press url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2000/06/23/pro_292640.shtml#.WNm7R2_ytpg}}</ref> ABC Sports-President Howard Katz told The Associated Press he felt "Monday Night Football was not as special as it used to be, and thats why weve taken the dramatic steps weve taken. We wanted to remove some of the sameness. We wanted to reinvent a little bit."<ref name=Booth/> Elsewhere Katz said "It may not work. We may find out that this is a bad idea. But I love taking the risk."<ref name=SI/> Ohlmeyer set out to try and recapture the viewer excitement of the Howard Cosell and Don Meredith era.<ref name=Booth/><ref name=Edge>{{cite news title=ABC Lives on Edge with Dennis Miller date=June 23, 2000 author=Larry Stewart url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/23/sports/sp-44165}}</ref>

ABC told the AP that each open position had around twenty viable candidates vying for it, who auditioned by sitting with Al Michaels (whom ABC had retained) and calling the previous season AFC playoff game Music City Miracle between Tennessee and Buffalo.<ref name=Booth/> Miller auditioned on June 12, 2000, sitting with Michaels in a Los Angeles studio to do such a mock broadcast.<ref name=SI/> Millers NFL knowledge surprised those in attendance. He had grown up watching the 1970s championship Steelers and was an avid watcher of the NFL draft. He had even inquired about an announcing job with Fox after they had acquired rights to show Fox NFL NFL games in 1994.<ref name=SI/> Michaels later told an interviewer, "It was way beyond what we expected. I had no idea that he knew as much about football as he did. He made points that other analysts we brought in never made, and his points were more salient, more interesting, and better stated. He was giving his riff, analyzing the plays and providing the humor. Amazing would not be an overstatement. Then I thought, Maybe hes shooting his wad here, and thats all were going to get. But he kept going. Hell, it was almost perfect. Don and I looked at each other and said, Wow. Where did this come from?."<ref name=SI/>

ABC told Sports Illustrated about the three-month process Ohlmeyer went through, including going through hundreds of tapes, slimming down to 40 candidates, and conducting 20 auditions (which included Jimmy Johnson, Bill Parcells, Steve Young, and John Elway).<ref name=SI/> The Los Angeles Times noted that ESPNs Sterling Sharpe appeared to have been ABCs first choice but he had refused to return phone calls to ABC.<ref name=Edge/> Ohlmeyer had considered Miller early in the process, more as offering a rant segment within the broadcast, but he began to think of him in an expanded role.<ref name=SI/>

By late June 2000, it was announced that Miller had beaten out Rush Limbaugh and Tony Kornheiser (among others) for a job as color commentator on ABCs Monday Night Football.<ref name=eonline>{{cite web  last=Armstrong  first=Mark  url=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,6673,00.html  title=Dennis Miller Takes Monday Night Pigskin publisher=E! date=June 22, 2000 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030221060805/http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,6673,00.html archivedate=February 21, 2003}}</ref><ref name=Edge/> The L.A. Times called Millers hiring "one of the boldest moves in sports television history," and noted that Miller, like Cosell, was "someone who is loved and hated," a person seen by some "as brilliant and witty; others see him as smug, pompous, and obnoxious."<ref name=Edge/> Show producer Ohlmeyer explained his thinking about hiring Miller: "Football is not played in St. Patricks Cathedral (Manhattan) St. Patricks Cathedral. People watch football to have some fun. We want a telecast thats relevant, successful, and unpredictable. If it doesnt work out, no amount of buzz will save us."<ref name=Booth/> Miller praised the producer, saying "I admire Ohlmeyers cojones. ... I think Im a pretty quirky hire. I admire him for that."<ref name=SI/>

After the announcement, Miller appeared on the July 3, 2000, cover of Sports Illustrated with the title "Can Dennis Miller Save Monday Night Football?".<ref name=Shockwaves>{{cite news title=Hiring of Dennis Miller Sends Shockwaves Through Industry date=December 21, 2005 url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2005/12/Issue-70/$MNF-On-ABC-1970-2005/Hiring-Of-Dennis-Miller-Sends-Shockwaves-Through-Industry.aspx work=Street & Smiths Sports Business Daily}}</ref><ref name=SI>{{cite news title=Live From New York, Its Monday Night! author=S.L.

Miller and the new broadcasting team (hold-over Al Michaels on play-by-play, Dan Fouts as analyst, and Eric Dickerson with Melissa Stark reporting from the sidelines) began airing through the preseason, starting on July 31, 2000, in the preseason Hall of Fame Game between the New England Patriots and the San Francisco 49ers.<ref name=Tulsa>{{cite news title=Tulsa-bound comedian Dennis Miller riffs on SNL, MNF and the origin of spin date=January 1, 2017 url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/tv/tulsa-bound-comedian-dennis-miller-riffs-on-snl-mnf-and/article_cdeb7b62-0ee9-5a78-ad71-6463eb913b6c.html author=Jimmie Tramel work=Tulsa World}}</ref> The shows official season opener was on September 4, 2000 with the Denver Broncos at the defending Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl champion History of the St. Louis Rams St. Louis Rams.<ref name=Booth/> Millers performance at the official opener was met with mixed reviews.

This guy just isnt very good."<ref name=Shockwaves/>

Throughout Millers Football coverage his commentary was sprinkled with esoteric references.<ref name=annotatedmiller>{{cite web url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/mnf/s/annotatedmiller/archive.html  title=The Annotated Dennis Miller Archive  publisher=ESPN  date=2002-01-14  accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> A common Miller-ism was after a Hail Mary pass fell incomplete, he would say "Hail Mary is denied—separation of church and state." He also once referred to "The Greatest Show on Turf"—the St. Louis Rams receiving corps—as the "Murderers Row of Haste."  Online options arose to offer definitions to references made by Miller on Monday Night Football: a website called "Dennis Miller Demystified", Encyclopædia Britannicas "Annotated Dennis Miller", and the Shadowpack (a "content aggregator, formatter, and e-commerce app"<ref>{{cite news title=Shadowpack date=August 1, 2000, publisher=PCMag.Com url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,24609,00.asp}}</ref>) giving real-time explanations on personal digital assistant.

As his first season progressed Millers critics held that "he sounds scripted."<ref name=Shockwaves/> The shows ratings continued to decline; in 2001 the show had 16.8 million viewers, down from 18.5 million the year before and below the 19.4 million of pre-Miller 1999.<ref name=LS>{{cite news title=Monday Night Football Hauls in Madden date=March 1, 2002 author=Larry Stewart work=Los Angeles Times url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/01/news/mn-30459}}</ref> As the ratings did not improve, writers from Newsweek and USA Today began openly calling for Miller to be let go.<ref name=Shockwaves/> Despite the questionable ratings, Miller and Fouts signed a contract for a third year.<ref name=TAE/>

Despite having hired Miller and Fouts for another year, ABC began negotiations with veteran football commentator John Madden. Madden had worked at Fox Sports for eight years since the network had won the contract for the NFC Conference games away from CBS in 1998. Since getting the NFL contract, Fox had lost $4.4&nbsp;billion (losing $387&nbsp;million due to the contract in 2001 alone), and was looking to cut programming costs.<ref name=Isidore>{{cite news author=Chris Isidore date=February 28, 2002 title=Madden leaves Fox for ABC url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/02/28/companies/fox_madden/}}</ref> Maddens contract for the next year would cost Fox $8 million, so when ABC was approaching Madden, Fox agreed to let him out of his remaining year on their contract.<ref name=Isidore/> Despite having been hired for another year, Miller and Fouts were replaced by Madden, who was signed on February 28, 2002 for $5 million a year for four years.<ref name=Shockwaves/><ref name=LS/> (Fouts remained with ABC, being moved to cover college football; Miller and Eric Dickerson were let go.)<ref name=Isidore/>

Miller later reflected, "The football thing was fun for me. I was in the middle of a maelstrom and I just decided not to pay attention to it because, for me, getting hired was a freakish act of nature. I had never gone to a football game. ... I remember the day I heard that John Madden had quit Fox (and) I remember calling Dan Fouts that afternoon and saying, Get ready, babe, we’re getting whacked....

Here was Madden, the Pliny the Elder of football announcers. And they were going to stay with the kid? I was having fun. I had alienated half the community, and probably half of them liked me. Which is pretty much my batting average. I began to see maybe a decade ago that my career was never going to be in complete approval. I wasnt endearing."<ref name=Joke/> When asked about "the Dennis Miller experiment," Madden told Sports Illustrated that he thought people tuned into Monday Night to view the game and not entertainment; "If I go to watch a comedian, I dont expect a football game to break out."<ref>{{cite news work=Sports Illustrated date=July 29, 2002 page=37 url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/703748/39/2 title=Monday Evening Quarterback author=Michael Silver}}</ref> Al Michaels, while overjoyed to work with Madden, praised Miller, saying, "what he tried to do was the hardest thing ever attempted in broadcasting.

By 2003, Miller began providing regular commentary for the Fox News show Hannity & Colmes. E!

CNBC had seen a slide in its ratings since Brian Williams was moved to NBC to replace retiring Tom Brokaw in its NBC Nightly News.<ref name=Byrne/> The network hadnt had a well-known personality in its prime-time lineup since the departure of Geraldo Rivera for Fox News in 2001.<ref name=BD/> The nighttime audience for CNBC was smaller than its cable competitors, causing the network to look for a new direction.<ref name=BD>{{cite news title=CNBC Gives Dennis Miller a Daily Show date=October 31, 2003 work=New York Times url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/31/business/cnbc-gives-dennis-miller-a-daily-show.html}}</ref> While it had been showing mostly business-oriented talk shows, such as Kudlow & Cramer and Capital Report,<ref name=BD/> NBC Entertainment president Jeff Zucker approached Miller with an offer to do a prime-time political show weeknights in CNBCs 9 p.m. (Eastern Time Zone ET) slot, which placed him against Foxs Bill OReilly.<ref name=Byrne/><ref name=Joke>{{cite news work=New York Times title=The Joke Is on Liberals, Says Dennis Miller, Host of His Own Show Again author=Bernard Weinraub date=January 15, 2004 url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/15/arts/the-joke-is-on-liberals-says-dennis-miller-host-of-his-own-show-again.html}}</ref>

Miller accepted the offer and the show, produced by NBC Studios,<ref name=BD/> began on January 26, 2004 called, simply, Dennis Miller.<ref name=Joke/> CNBC announced that they were "comfortable with an unabashed Bush fan in the middle of its prime-time schedule in an election year."<ref name=BCM/> Their president Pamela Thomas-Graham said, "When we hired Dennis, we knew exactly what his political beliefs were and his viewers will hear them. The reason we hired him is we think hes witty, smart and interesting. Hes part of a lineup. Hes not the only person in the lineup." She contrasted his political leanings to that of John McEnroes, whose own talk show followed Millers in the lineup.<ref name=BCM/> The group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting objected that one of the shows producers was Mike Murphy, who was an adviser to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and charged that CNBC was setting up a conflict of interest.<ref name=BCM/>

Miller promised to serve as "an ombudsman who will tell it like it is and become incensed on the viewers behalf".<ref name=Bernhard/> Miller said he wanted to change his approach from previous talk-show work, striving for seriousness and substance by researching issues, to avoid becoming an "irony-lalapalooza like its been in the past. ...I dont want to become some ageing hipster who pisses on everything."<ref name=NMax/> Stylistically Miller was seen as "attempting to be serious, angry, and funny all at the same time," and the show was compared to that of Bill Maher.<ref name=Bernhard/> When asked if he had the credentials to do a quasi-news show, Miller stressed he was an entertainer. "I dont have credibility, Im a comedian. Im not Ed Murrow up on the roof in a London Fog reporting on the Blitz."<ref name=BCM/>

In the beginning of the series, Miller had a chimpanzee on the show named Ellie, who was declared a "consultant."<ref name=Bernhard>{{cite news work=LA Weekly title=Millers Crossing author=Brendan Bernhard date=March 4, 2004 url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/millers-crossing-2137853}}</ref> This was a nod to the early days of the Today (NBC program) Today show and their mascot J.

The hour-long show contained a daily news segment called "The Daily Rorschach inkblot test Rorschach", which were wordy riffs on the news events, reminiscent of his role on SNLs Weekend Update and his HBO show.<ref name=Bernhard/> Reviewers felt Millers riffs would benefit from a live audience for him to feed off of, and the show incorporated a "nightclub-style audience of 100 or so" beginning on March 9, 2004.<ref name=Bernhard/> A sign giving out the toll-free telephone number to order tickets was held up by Mo.<ref name=Bernhard/>

For the first half of the show Miller interviewed someone held to be able to explain a particular current issue in the news. L.A. Weekly remarked, "Miller may be up front about his own political affiliation, even to the point of shilling for the Republicans, but despite his increasingly aggressive America-first humor, he is unusually evenhanded in his selection of guests."<ref name=Bernhard/> Miller had laid out his vision for such interviews before the show began airing, telling The Associated Press, "I dont want it to be a screaming shriekfest. I want it to be a pretty reasoned discourse. I dont care what Gary Coleman thinks about Afghanistan, which to me was the flaw of Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher Politically Correct towards the end."<ref name=BCM/>

For its second half, the show also featured a panel discussion dubbed "The Varsity", which offered a wide variety of political viewpoints on current topics. Frequent "Varsity" panelists included Ed Schultz, Gloria Allred, Willie Lewis Brown, Jr. Willie Brown, David Horowitz (conservative writer) David Horowitz, Mickey Kaus, Steve Katz (politician) Steven Katz, Lawrence ODonnell, Phil Hendrie, and Harry Shearer. In these segments, Miller acted "less like a host than a fellow conversationalist, and seems as happy to listen as to interrupt. But he does get in a few wisecracks."<ref name=Bernhard/> Miller was praised by LA Weekly for approaching the panel in a "relatively relaxed and straightforward attitude."  Despite having "worked briefly as a commentator for Hannity and Colmes on Fox, hes far from being a Rupert Murdoch Murdochian attack dog, and he often sits there and sucks it up while people tell him just how awful the administration of his beloved commander-in-chief really is. ... Miller, it turns out, is considerably more interested in diversity than some of his liberal counterparts."<ref name=Bernhard/>

Fellow SNL alum Tim Meadows and Last Comic Standings Ant (comedian) Ant portrayed humorous field correspondents which served as a break between the political humor.<ref name=Carl/>

The show was openly pro-President George W. Bush and it debuted at the same time that John Kerry had become the Democratic front-runner. The inability to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, a budget that was seen as out of control, and a resentment over the Presidents tough-talking cowboy image had all caused a major decline in President Bushs approval numbers.<ref name=Bernhard/> While Millers rating started out well with his first episode interviewing his friend Schwarzenegger (The New York Times put the figure at 746,000 people, which was a big number in the eyes of CNBC), by March 2004 his numbers had slipped to 300,000.<ref name=Bernhard/> This was contrasted by The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, which attracted 1.9&nbsp;million viewers, and which aired at the later time slot of 11&nbsp;pm.<ref name=Bernhard/>

By April 2005, Millers viewership had declined to 107,000 (a 59% drop from the year before).<ref name=CNNM>{{cite news title=CNBC cancels Dennis Miller date=May 12, 2005 work=CNN Money url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/05/12/news/newsmakers/cnbc_miller/}}</ref> CNBC canceled the show in May 2005 as part of the networks move to refocus on financial news (airings of Late Night with Conan OBrien and shows hosted by John McEnroe and Tina Brown were also cancelled).<ref name=CNNM/> Millers show was replaced with a second airing of Mad Money with Jim Cramer.<ref>{{cite web title=Dennis Miller & Me author=Asra Nomani date=May 31, 2005 work=the American Prospect}}</ref><ref name=CNNM/>

==Radio career==

===The Dennis Miller Show===
In January 2007, Miller signed a deal with Westwood One (1976–2011) Westwood One (later acquired by Dial Global, which rebranded itself as Westwood One (current) Westwood One) to launch The Dennis Miller Show (radio) The Dennis Miller Show, a weekday three-hour talk radio program.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWEN204120070112  title=Dennis Miller starting radio show on Westwood One  agency=Reuters  date= January 10, 2007 accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref> The program debuted on March 26, 2007, and ran through February 27, 2015.<ref>{{cite web url=http://affiliates.westwoodone.com/features/dennis-miller-show.asp  title=The Dennis Miller Show  publisher=Affiliates.westwoodone.com  accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> The shows website<ref>{{cite web first=Payam last=Zarrabizadeh  url=http://www.dennismillerradio.com/  title=The Official Home of Dennis Miller on the Web  publisher=Dennismillerradio.com  accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> provided a live stream of the broadcast. The site also made archives of all shows available in MP3 format. The live feed was free, but a subscription to the Dennis Miller Zone (DMZ) was required in order to access archived broadcasts. The show aired on 250+ stations, many of which (especially in the major markets at the time of the shows launch) were owned by Salem Communications,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/3/20/121544.shtml?s=ic  title=Dennis Miller Readies to Host Radio Show  publisher=Newsmax.com  date=2007-03-20  accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> airing on tape delay on some of those stations between 6–9 pm ET and 9 pm-12 am ET. Salem stations also aired a "best of" Miller show on Saturdays. His on-air sidekick "Salman" (David S. Weiss) also wrote for Dennis Miller Live. His producer Christian Bladt previously appeared on-camera as dozens of different characters during the "Daily Rorschach" segment on his CNBC television show.

Millers program included serious discussions about American culture, current events, politics, and their place in the global context. The show was infused with Millers sarcasm, which is often characterized by obscure popular culture pop culture references.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.millerjoke.com/ title=Dennis Miller Joke Generator publisher=millerjoke.com}}</ref> For example, each hour of the show once opened with an arcane reference. The first hours opening phrase was a combination of dialogue from the film Thank You for Smoking (film) Thank You for Smoking and a U.S. space program slogan coined by Alan Shepard:<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.dennismillerradio.com/show?action=viewRadioShow&showID=70 title=Dennis Miller Radio: The Dennis Miller Show accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref> "Whats up, Hiroshi? Lets light this candle!" Millers other opening phrases for his second and third hours respectively were "Come to me my babies, let me quell your pain", (Powers Boothe as Jim Jones in Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones<ref>Dennis Miller Radio Show, Hour 2, December 18, 2007./</ref>) and "ABC – Always be closing if you want the knife set" (from Glengarry Glen Ross).

Most shows featured three guests (one per hour), mostly from the world of politics and entertainment, as well as calls from listeners. Guests included fellow comedians and SNL alumni (such as Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz), pundits and authors such as Ann Coulter, Aaron Klein and Mark Steyn (while the shows guest list leaned right-wing right of center, there were several liberals who appeared on the show, such as Dennis Kucinich and Alan Dershowitz), Presidential candidates, several sports commentators, and some "regulars" like columnists and conservatives Debra Saunders, Charles Krauthammer, Victor Davis Hanson, John R. Bolton John Bolton, William Kristol Bill Kristol, and Jerome Corsi along with entertainers such as singer Peter Noone of Hermans Hermits and actor Orson Bean. Miller generally took calls every hour, and in addition to comments about culture and politics, Miller encouraged humorous callers and often commented on their comedic delivery. A segment on Fridays was set aside for "Dennis Deus Ex Machina Ex Machina", his term for a segment without a guest, where he allowed phone calls on any topic.

In a 2007 interview Miller said he felt that his radio show of all his work best represented his actual unvarnished views, saying "This time, if Im fired, they will be firing the real Dennis Miller."<ref name=IR>{{cite web work=Illinois Review date=July 31, 2007 title=After 30 Years, the Real Dennis Miller url=http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2007/07/after-30-years-.html}}</ref>

===Other endeavors===
Miller periodically performs stand-up at the Orleans Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. In recent appearances, he has done a mix of his old and new material, with some political jokes as well.

He has authored four books based on his stand-up comedy and television monologues: The Rants (1996), Ranting Again (1999), I Rant, Therefore I Am (2000), and The Rant Zone (2001).

Miller has appeared in several films, in both comedic and non-comedic roles. His movie credits include Madhouse (1990 film) Madhouse, Disclosure (film) Disclosure, The Net (1995 film) The Net, Never Talk to Strangers, Bordello of Blood, What Happens in Vegas and Murder at 1600. He played the Howard Stern-like talk-radio host Zander Kelly in Joe Dirt (2001) and appeared as himself in Thank You for Smoking (film) Thank You for Smoking (2006).

Miller guest hosted the Slammy Awards episode of WWE Raw on December 14, 2009.

==Comedic style==
Miller has a laid-back style (for example, calling people "babe" or "cat") and an acerbic, brooding sense of humor. His specialty is the rant, which typically begin with "Now, I dont want to get off on a rant here, but..." and end with "...of course, thats just my opinion. I could be wrong."

Miller listed his comedic influences for The New York Times as including "Jonathan Miller, Richard Pryor, Richard Belzer and Mr. [Jay] Leno."<ref name=Joke/> When the Times asked him about the comedians Mort Sahl and Lenny Bruce, to whom he is often compared, Miller stated that he had been impressed with transcripts of Sahls early work but that as Sahls career continued he became too tied to the Kennedy family and became a "savage name-dropper," which diminished him in Millers eyes, and served as an example for him to avoid. Miller had no respect for Bruce, telling the Times, "Lenny was a heroin addict, and I couldnt care less about heroin addicts. Once I hear a guy is a heroin addict, and they tell me hes a genius, I think, Really? Im not trying to be judgmental. But anybody whose last vision is of a tile pattern on a bathroom floor, I dont know what kind of genius they are."<ref name=Joke/>

Describing his career Miller stated, "Its all been built on arcane references, precision of language, and a reasonably imperturbable nature on TV. The basics are there, but Ive been getting paid, making a living and having fun with it for next to 25 years, and you know that blows my mind that Ive stuck with it. Thats my favorite part of showbiz, hangin in, knowing that something good is coming along. ... When I was starting, I thought Id have to have a sword-in-the-stone moment of inspiration where Id have to lay around for it to be visited on me. SNL was just a machine, and if you screwed two or three Updates up, guess what, they have someone new and ready to go. So I learned how to pick up any newspaper and have five usable jokes in five minutes. "I dont ever wanna get self-important. Im a comedian, and I want everyone in my life to know it. The stream-of-consciousness style is my monkey trick. I sit there, I watch stuff, and cultural references bump into my head. I watched a lot of TV when I was a kid."<ref name=Carl/>

Miller has referred to his casual stage-style as "quasi-Dean Martin insouciance."<ref name=SI/> When asked if hes accepted others title of him as "the intelligent comedian," he replied, "The smartest thing I ever did was not buying into the fact that people thought I was smart. I was telling jokes about where I named the robot maid for The Jetsons. Its just a joke. I just did jokes. I never had my head up my ass that I mattered. I’m trying to get laughs. ... Im OK [intelligence-wise]. I remember I had a writer once who told me—and we disagreed about everything, so I know he didnt think I was smart—but he said, Ill give you this. You have a deep drawer and a nice retrieval system. I always thought that was a good appraisal of whatever limited comedy gift I had. I have a pretty good memory for pop arcana and a pretty quick retrieval system."<ref name=Tulsa/>

==Personal life==
Miller married Carolyn "Ali" Espley,<ref>Reliable sources spell her name variously as "Espley" or "Epsley." In the closing credits of Mr. Miller Goes to Washington, she is listed as "Ali Espley".</ref> a former model from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on April 24, 1988. Espley is best known as the girl in Kajagoogoos 1983 "Too Shy" music video. The couple live in Santa Barbara, California, and have two sons, Holden (born 1990) and Marlon (born 1993). His younger brother Jimmy Miller is a partner in the Hollywood management company Gold/Miller representing comedians such as Jim Carrey, Will Ferrell, Judd Apatow, and Sacha Baron Cohen.<ref name=Joke/>

==Political views==
Although in his early years of fame he was perceived to be a staunch Modern liberalism in the United States liberal and an outspoken critic of Republican Party (United States) Republicans, in recent years, Miller has become known for his Conservatism in the United States neoconservative political opinions.<ref>{{cite web author=Currie, Duncan date=June 27, 2003 title=Dennis the Right-Wing Menace?   work=National Review url=http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment062703.asp accessdate=February 27, 2006}}</ref>

He was a regular political commentator on Fox News Channels The OReilly Factor in a segment called "Miller Time", and previously appeared on the networks Hannity & Colmes in a segment called "Real Free Speech."

===Early outlook===
When asked if his political outlook was a result of early influence by his parents, Miller told a reporter "I didnt know my dad—he moved out early. And my moms politics were kind of hardscrabble. She didnt think about Democratic Party (United States) Democrats or Republican Party (United States) Republicans. She thought about who made sense. Ive been both in my life. Somebody can say they dont understand why somebody drifts. But Ive always found people who drift interesting, cause it shows me the games not stagnant in their own head. Theyre thinking."<ref name=Winters/>

During the late 1980s and continuing through the 1990s, Miller was generally perceived as a cynic on the Left-wing politics left, eager to bash conservative Republicans.

Miller has said that he privately began to change his politics in 1992 when liberals made jokes about the poor performance Ross Perots running mate James Stockdale displayed during a televised debate. Stockdale was a decorated Vietnam prisoner of war, and Miller saw jokes about him as mockery. Miller would later comment, "You know, Stockdale, we would have been blessed to have him as a President. I dont care if hes bad on TV. He was a hero and an icon. I saw people on the left go, Whos this old guy whos bad on TV?... If hes the problem, thats too hip a room for me. Thats when I got out."<ref>{{cite news first=Greg last=Richter title=Dennis Miller: Liberal Mockery of Stockdale Made Me Conservative url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Dennis-Miller-James-Stockdale-Ross-Perot-conservative/2014/06/04/id/575254/ website=Newsmax publisher=Newsmax Media location=Palm Beach, Florida date=June 4, 2014 accessdate=July 15, 2018}}</ref>

The perception that Miller was a member of the political left did not change much, even when Miller told USA Today in 1995: "I might be profane and opinionated, but underneath all that are some pretty conservative feelings. On most issues, between Bill Clinton Clinton and Newt Gingrich, Id choose Newt in a second, even though he is a bit too exclusionary."<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web url=http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment062703.asp  title=Duncan Currie on Dennis Miller on National Review Online publisher=Nationalreview.com accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> Miller also declared himself a "Libertarian conservatism conservative libertarian" in a 1996 Playboy interview.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

Miller would later tell American Enterprise that one of the reasons he became more conservative was due to liberal critiques of Mayor Rudy Giulianis Mayoralty of Rudy Giuliani#Crime control approach to fighting crime in New York City, which began around 1994. "When I kept hearing liberals equating Giuliani with Adolf Hitler Hitler—thats when I really left the reservation. Even before 9/11, Id travel to New York and say, Wow, this city certainly seems to be running better. Giuliani is the kind of leader I admire. When its five below zero and you arrest somebody to get him inside off the street—thats not something Hitler would do. It made me realize that I was with the wrong group if thats what Hitler looked like to them."<ref name=TAE>{{cite web work=The American Enterprise title="Live" with TAE - Dennis Miller url=http://cbc-wb01x.chemistry.ohio-state.edu/~jherring/war/livewithdennismiller.pdf date=October 1, 2003}}</ref>

In a 1998 piece, L.

===Post September 11, 2001 attacks===
Millers ideology changed significantly in the years following the September 11, 2001, attacks.<ref name=CNN>{{cite news agency=Associated Press date=January 26, 2004 title=Dennis Miller: 9–11 changed me publisher=CNN url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/26/tv.dennismiller.ap accessdate=February 27, 2006 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208220107/http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/26/tv.dennismiller.ap archivedate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> He called the attack "the biggest tragedy in the history of this country," and that it not only temporarily halted his comedy but made it difficult to talk. "I couldnt put together a sentence for two weeks, much less something pithy."<ref name=TAE/>

His convictions led him to become one of the few Hollywood celebrities backing George W. Bush and the war in Iraq.<ref name=CNN/> Miller has said that one of the defining moments, in addition to 9/11, for his move from the Democratic Party (United States) Democratic to the Republican Party (United States) Republican Party was watching a 2004 primary election primary debate between the nine Democrats then contending for their partys nomination. "I havent seen a starting nine like that since the 1962 New York Mets season 62 Mets," he remarked.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

In a 2007 interview with Bill OReilly, Miller spoke on the subject of his political outlook. "Well, listen. I must say that I never considered myself a secular progressive. ... I didnt consider myself that then, and I dont consider myself to be Curtis LeMay now. I have always thought of myself as a pragmatist. And I began to see a degree of certitude on the left that I found unsettling. I dont like lockstep, even if its lockstep about being open-minded. And after 9/11, I remember thinking we might have to get into some preemptive measures here. And that seemed to put me—I dont know—off to the kids table." He said that his more open conservatism may have cost him some passing acquaintances, but it has not affected "my dear friends. I certainly hope our friendship runs deeper than that. I still have some ultra-liberal friends."<ref>{{cite news title=Why Did Comedian/Commentator Dennis Miller Abandon his Liberal Beliefs? date=August 23, 2007 publisher=FoxNews.com url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/08/23/why-did-comediancommentator-dennis-miller-abandon-his-liberal-beliefs.html}}</ref>

While not at all shy about expressing his conservative views on topics such as Taxation in the United States taxes and foreign policy, Miller is quick to point out that he is still quite Cultural liberalism liberal on many social issues, including abortion and Same-sex marriage gay marriage.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> During a 2004 interview, Miller said "Ive always been a pragmatist. If two gay guys want to get married, its none of my business. I could care less. More power to them. Im happy when people fall in love. But if some idiot foreign terrorist wants to blow up their wedding to make a political statement, I would rather kill him before he can do it, or have my country kill him before he can do it, instead of having him do it and punishing him after the fact. If that makes me a right-wing fanatic, I will bask in that assignation. ... I think abortions wrong, but its none of my business to tell somebody whats wrong. So Im pro-choice. I want to keep my nose out of other peoples personal business. I guess I fall into conservative when it comes to protecting the United States in a world where a lot of people hate the United States. ... [After 9/11] everybody should be in the protection business now. I cant imagine anybody not saying that. Well, I guess on the farthest end of the left theyd say, Thats our fault. And on the middle end theyd say, Well, theres another way to deal with it other than flat-out protecting ourselves. I just dont believe that. People say were the ones who make them hate us because of what we do. Thats garbage to me. I think theyre nuts. And youve got to protect yourself from nuts."<ref name=Joke/>

Along these same lines, Miller is open about his religious views, saying "Im not a Christian, but I believe in God.  Whether or not someone is pro-choice is none of my business. Thats Gods business. Its in His job description, not mine."<ref name=IR/>

During an interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, he said that he did not believe in global warming.<ref>[http://www.pennlive.com/entertainment/patriotnews/index.ssf?/base/entertainment/116187813997730.xml&coll=1 The Patriot News]  {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014073505/http://www.pennlive.com/entertainment/patriotnews/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fentertainment%2F116187813997730.xml&coll=1  date=October 14, 2007 }}</ref>

In a radio interview with Penn Jillette on September 22, 2006, Miller explained his libertarianism, saying, "...[a libertarian is] what I am, Ill be honest with you. Im for gay marriage. I dont believe in abortion but Im pro-choice cause its none of my business. Pretty much anything goes with me if youre not infringing yourself on other people, but Ill tell ya, 9/11 changed me....

In a 2012 interview, Miller showed no concern over whether his political stance had made him less popular or robbed him of the credit of popularizing comedic rants, saying, "Im a 58-year-old man and I’m happy where I’m at. I dont think about any of that. I go on O’Reilly once a week, I do my radio show and I go on the road about 20 dates a year. Ive winnowed my crowd down to a select few who can support me. If you’re 58 and you’re still worrying about whether youre popular, what are you, in eighth grade? I must have started in earnest when I was 25 so I’m working on a quarter century here. I still talk and they give me green rectangles."<ref name=Wenzel/> Miller told another interviewer that he thinks about half of America likes him and the other half hates him, but he has become comfortable with that. "I used to want everybody to like me, but as you get older you can see theres something to be said for agitating your enemies."<ref name=NMax/>

===George W. Bush===
An indication of Millers political change can be seen in his view of President George W. Bush. Miller had previously joked about George W. Bushs intelligence in a July 31, 2000 interview about joining Monday Night Football, a Los Angeles Times reporter noted, "He shifted from Jim Brown to George W. Bush: God, the man thinks Croatia is the show thats on after Moesha."<ref>{{cite news url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jul/31/sports/sp-61994 date=July 31, 2000 title=Dennis Miller, Making His Debut Tonight in the ABC Broadcast Booth Is ... author=David Wharton work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref><ref name=Tulsa/> In another incident he joked, "Bush cant walk and fart at the same time."<ref name=Krassner>{{cite book title=One Hand Jerking: Reports From an Investigative satirist author=Paul Krassner publisher=Seven Stories Press date=2005}}</ref> In January, 2001 on his HBO series, Miller joked, "Condoleezza Rice has often been described as Ws foreign policy tutor.

After 9/11, Millers opinion had altered dramatically. In 2003 Miller told an interviewer that he was impressed by Bush for pursuing "the liquidation of terrorism," even though "thats not gonna be finished in his lifetime... But to take the first step? Ballsy."<ref name=Winters/> He felt it was likely that "the secular state of Iraq and Islamic fundamentalists cohabitate," as "they both think were Satan."<ref name=Winters/> He concluded with, "I will say this, I feel more politically engaged than Ive ever felt in my life because I do think we live in dangerous times, and anybody who looks at the world and says this is the time to be a wuss—I cant buy that anymore."<ref name=Winters/> Miller showed his commitment to Bush by speaking at the Presidents fund-raisers in Los Angeles and San Francisco.<ref name=Eyeing/><ref name=Collins/> During this time, he jokingly referred to himself as "a Rat Pack of one for the president in Hollywood."<ref name=Krassner/>The Los Angeles Times noted that he was "raising his political profile" at this time, and that he "spoke out passionately in favor of the Iraq War war in Iraq. He has made frequent appearances on conservative talk radio; he does weekly political commentary for Hannity & Colmes, a Fox News Channel talk show."<ref name=Eyeing/>

In 2003, The Weekly Standard called Miller "the loudest pro-Bush/pro-war voice in Cinema of the United States Hollywood",<ref name=WS/> and quoted his comment on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno from February of that year. Miller advocated invading Iraq, and vented his displeasure at Frances lack of support for the idea, saying, "I say we invade Iraq and then invade Jacques Chirac Chirac. You run a pipe—you run a pipe from the oil field right over this Eiffel Tower, shoot it up and have the worlds biggest oil derrick. ... Listen, I would call the French scum bags, but that, of course, would be a disservice to bags filled with scum."<ref name=WS/> That same year, The National Review wrote, "Conservatives ... have welcomed and even cheered the comedians unabashed patriotism and endorsement of President Bushs foreign—and, in certain cases, domestic—policy."<ref name=Currie/> They noted that "During appearances on The Tonight Show, he has also advocated profiling at airports and oil-drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge."<ref name=Currie>{{cite web url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/207356/dennis-right-wing-menace-duncan-currie title=Comedian Miller gets a FNC gig author=Duncan Currie date=June 27, 2003 work=National Review}}</ref>

On March 23, 2003 Michael Moore delivered an antiwar speech at the Academy Awards while accepting an Oscar for Bowling for Columbine. The speech in part accused the Bush administration of misleading the public in order to go into war, criticized the governments claims that Americans could secure their homes from biological, chemical or radiological attack by use of plastic sheeting and duct tape,<ref>{{cite news publisher=CNN date=February 11, 2003 url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/11/emergency.supplies author=Jeanne Meserve title=Duct tape sales rise amid terror fears}}</ref> and held the color alerts of the Homeland Security Advisory System as suspect. Moore stated, "We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons. Whether its the fiction of duct tape or the fiction of Homeland Security Advisory System orange alerts, we are against this war, Mr. Bush. Shame on you, Mr. Bush, shame on you."<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/blog/docsoup/2013/02/the-infamous-oscar-speech-heard-around-the-world/ title=The Infamous Oscar Speech Heard Around the World date=February 21, 2013 publisher=PBS author=Tom Roston}}</ref> In response, Miller stated that when "we say that we love it [the USA] ... hes going to tell us what naive sheep we are and that hes the true patriot because he hates it and he sees all the problems in it. Michael Moore simultaneously represents everything I detest in a human being and everything I feel obligated to defend in an American.

In May 2003, Miller was invited by The Wall Street Journal to write an opinion piece in response to Norman Mailers anti-war commentary in The London Times that had appeared earlier in the month, and which had claimed, "With their dominance in sport, at work and at home eroded, Bush thought white American men needed to know they were still good at something.

And as Mr. Mailers prostate gradually supplants his ego as the largest gland in his body, hes going to have to realize, as is the case with all young lions who inevitably morph into Bert Lahr, that his alleged profundities are now being perceived as the early predictors of dementia."<ref name=Krassner/>

In October 2003, Millers interview with The American Enterprise was published where he praised Bush, saying, "Hes much smarter than his enemies think he is. I think hes a genius. People whine about him getting into Yale—the way I see it, if your old man buys a building you should get into Yale! But I think he could have gotten into Yale on his own; hes a very smart man. ... The fact that midway through his life he realized he was drinking too much and screwing up and stopped it—thats more impressive than what college he attended. What he did is a fine accomplishment, and I think its putting him in touch with his God. ... In this messed up world, I like seeing my President pray. I don’t think a person can get answers out of books anymore. This is an infinitely complex world, and at some point one has to have faith in ones religion. I find it endearing that President Bush prays to God and that he’s not an agnostic or an atheist. Im glad there’s someone higher that he has to answer to."<ref name=TAE/>

In the AE interview, Miller was asked about the outrage and public destruction of their music CDs that occurred as a response to the Dixie Chicks Natalie Maines Dixie Chicks#2003.E2.80.9305: Controversy criticizing Bush at one of their concerts, when she said, "Were ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas."<ref name=TAE/> Miller stated, "The Dixie Chicks got exactly what they deserved. In a time of war, to go on foreign soil [London, England] and decry your President should probably cause a hue and cry. When it first happened, I thought, "Im never going to buy another one of their albums." And then I thought, "You know what, I’ve never bought one of their albums—I dont like their music."<ref name=TAE/>

Miller sat in the gallery of two of President Bushs State of the Union addresses, on September 2, 2002, and as the Presidents guest on January 21, 2004.<ref>{{cite web title=Dennis Miller Celebrity work=TV Guide url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/dennis-miller/bio/147096/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web title=State of the Union date=September 2, 2002 author=Douglas Graham url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/actor-dennis-miller-listens-to-president-george-w-bush-news-photo/99878130#actor-dennis-miller-listens-to-president-george-w-bush-during-his-of-picture-id99878130}}</ref><ref>{{cite web title=State of the Union author=Gouglas Graham date=January 21, 2004 publisher=Getty Images url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/actor-dennis-miller-listens-to-president-george-w-bush-news-photo/99877468#actor-dennis-miller-listens-to-president-george-w-bush-during-his-of-picture-id99877468}}</ref><ref name=BCM/>

In 2004, while Miller prepared to host his CNBC program, he told The Associate Press that his show was not going to do any jokes about George W. Bush, explaining, "I like him.

Im not interested in hurting people, and its not just because of 9/11."<ref name=Carl/>

Reflecting on his thoughts near the end of Bushs second term in 2007, Miller still had good words for Bush. "After 9/11 it was a different world.

===Candidacy consideration===
In 2003, Rob Stutzman and other members of the leadership for the Californian Republican party, after seeing the political success of Arnold Schwarzenegger, approached Miller in an effort to draft him to challenge Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. Miller had supported California gubernatorial recall election Schwarzeneggers candidacy, even acting as its post-debate spokesperson after the Sacramento gubernatorial debate on September 24, 2003. He went on to speak at a Schwarzenegger rally that same night.<ref name=Eyeing>{{cite news title=Republican Strategists Eyeing Dennis Miller for State Politics date=September 27, 2003 author=Joe Mathews work=LA Times url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/27/local/me-miller27}}</ref><ref name=Collins/>

When asked about the possibility of facing a Miller candidacy, Boxer spokesman Roy Behr dismissed his odds: "The Republican Party has gone through a desperate search to find someone who is remotely credible—theyve looked at everybody and everything, and they couldnt find anybody, so theyre looking at bringing in the circus. I think the public has always registered how they feel about Dennis Miller.

The Weekly Standards Bill Whalen saw that, with the ascent of Schwarzenegger, other celebrities were considering political careers (such as Republican Kelsey Grammer). Examining Millers chances for the Senate seat the Standard pointed out that it was "hard to imagine a candidate quicker on the draw or more withering in a debate."<ref name=WS>{{cite web title=Miller Time?

Not to mention a little too edgy for some Republicans."<ref name=WS/> The Standard noted that he had been booed by some in the Republican audience during his Los Angeles fund-raiser for President Bush when he said Democratic "West Virginia senator Robert Byrd must be burning the cross at both ends."<ref name=WS/> Miller had responded "Well, he was in the Ku Klux Klan Klan. Boo me, but he was in the Klan."<ref name=WS/> The Standard said "hed be an HBO politician trying to play to a T.G.I. Fridays electorate."<ref name=WS/>

When asked about Millers chances, Martin Kaplan, director of University of Southern California USCs Norman Lear Center theorized that Miller might face a tough primary battle to win the Republican nomination from other members of the party that had actual political experience. He told a reporter that while Miller did have good name recognition, unlike Schwarzenegger he did not have the ability to "chill the enthusiasm of other Republicans from getting into the race."<ref name=Eyeing/>

By November 2003, the New York Times did a piece on the Republican opposition to Boxer and reported that "Mr. Miller was never serious about the idea, Republican officials who spoke with him say. ... Dennis has never contacted us, said Duf Sundheim George M. Sundheim III, chairman of the state Republican Party".<ref name=Murphy/> The Times pointed out that while the Republican Party was talking about drafting him, Miller "had signed a multiyear contract with CNBC as a political talk show host."<ref name=Murphy>{{cite news title=Despite Glints of Hope, California G.O.P.

===Saturday Night Live 40th anniversary===
Miller did not appear on the 2015 show for the 40th anniversary of Saturday Night Live, and rumors spread that he and fellow alum Victoria Jackson had not been invited due to their conservative political activism. Miller took to Twitter to dispel such claims, calling Lorne Michaels classy and well-mannered, and insisting that everyone was invited.

In 1988, Miller voted for George H. W.

When Ross Perot dropped out of the Presidential race on July 16, 1992, saying he feared a conspiracy against his family, many began to joke about his sanity. On July 30, 1995, Miller told a reporter, "Id vote for him [Perot] tomorrow. I dont think hes a genius but I love the thought of him at State Dinners mistaking the Margrethe II of Denmark Queen of Denmark for Kaye Ballard. People say to me, You wouldnt want Ross Perot with his finger on the button. But believe me, they would never let Ross Perot near the real button.
