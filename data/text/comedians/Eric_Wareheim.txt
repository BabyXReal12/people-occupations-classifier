The Tim and Eric name was solidly branded with the release of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! which premiered on February 11, 2007. The show is a mix of "live action, sketch, animation, emotions, phone calls, love, etc." according to their website. The creators have described the show as the "nightmare version of television".<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/arts/television/27itzk.html title=The Bizarre Brains of Nightmare TV first=Dave last=Itzkoff work=New York Times date=2008-07-27 accessdate=2018-02-20}}</ref>

In a July 2008 New York Times article, it was reported that the duo was in the process of developing a surreal game show series starring Neil Hamburger, titled The New Big Ball with Neil Hamburger.<ref name="nyt">New York Times article: "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/arts/television/27itzk.html?_r=1&ref=television&oref=slogin The Bizarre Brains of Nightmare TV]".</ref><ref>Hardford Advocate article: "[http://www.hartfordadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=9112 Hamburger Helper: Americas worst comedian performs in New Haven and then in Northampton]".</ref> Wareheim described it as a mix between "Japanese variety show Japanese bizarre game show and The Price Is Right."<ref name="nyt" /> In late July 2009, Neil Hamburger posted a blog on MySpace stating that a pilot (television) pilot had been filmed, but that Adult Swim was not satisfied and had "pulled the plug on the project."<ref>MySpace blog post by Neil Hamburger: "[http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=53055268&blogId=501569194 The New Big Ball] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view  date=2009-02-07 }}".</ref>
