Eric Alexander Wareheim ({{IPAc-en ˈ w ɛər h aɪ m}}; born April 7, 1976) is an American actor, comedian, writer, director, and musician. He is one half of the comedy duo Tim &amp; Eric, alongside Tim Heidecker. They created the television shows Tom Goes to the Mayor, Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule, and Tim and Erics Bedtime Stories.

Wareheim was born in Audubon, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Methacton High School in Norristown, Pennsylvania and then later attended Temple University, where he met his comedy partner Tim Heidecker and produced his first film about dads, shot on the Jersey shore.
==Career==
Wareheim and Heidecker are the creators, writers, and stars of Tom Goes to the Mayor, a limited animation that was on the Adult Swim programming block on Cartoon Network.  Wareheim and Heidecker had mailed copies of an early version of the show to comedian Bob Odenkirk, who agreed to take on the project as the executive producer of the series and sold it to Cartoon Network.
The Tim and Eric name was solidly branded with the release of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! which premiered on February 11, 2007. The show is a mix of "live action, sketch, animation, emotions, phone calls, love, etc." according to their website. The creators have described the show as the "nightmare version of television".
On May 2, 2010 the "Man Milk" episode of "Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!" wrapped Season 5 of the show. Though this would be the last serial content for "Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!" there was an hour-long holiday program titled "Chrimbus Special" that gave fans a last glimpse at the TV program. It was the second show Wareheim both produced and starred in which aired during Cartoon Networks Adult Swim block.{{citation needed date=February 2018}}

Between May and June 2010, six episodes of an Awesome Show spin-off produced in part by Wareheim, Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule, were aired on Cartoon Network. The show parodied local newscasts. According to Heidecker, John C. Reilly had the original idea of giving the Dr. Steve character an entire show.
In a July 2008 New York Times article, it was reported that the duo was in the process of developing a surreal game show series starring Neil Hamburger, titled The New Big Ball with Neil Hamburger.
Wareheim described it as a mix between "Japanese variety show Japanese bizarre game show and The Price Is Right."
In late July 2009, Neil Hamburger posted a blog on MySpace stating that a pilot (television) pilot had been filmed, but that Adult Swim was not satisfied and had "pulled the plug on the project."
