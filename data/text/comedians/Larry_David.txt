After college, David Military service enlisted in the United States Army Reserve.
==Career==
While a stand-up comedian,
Larry David also worked as a store clerk, limousine driver, and historian. He lived in Manhattan Plaza, a federally subsidized housing complex in the Hells Kitchen, Manhattan Hells Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, across the hall from Kenny Kramer, the inspiration for the Cosmo Kramer character in Seinfeld.
David then became a writer for and cast member of American Broadcasting Company ABCs Fridays (TV series) Fridays from 1980 to 1982, and a writer for NBCs Saturday Night Live (SNL) from 1984 to 1985.
During his time at SNL, he was able to get only one sketch on the show, which aired at 12:50 AM, the last time slot on the show.
David quit his writing job at SNL in the first season, only to show up to work a few days later acting as though nothing had happened. That event inspired a second-season episode of Seinfeld entitled "The Revenge (Seinfeld) The Revenge".
David met his future Seinfeld stars during that early stage of his career: he worked with Michael Richards (Kramer) on Fridays
and with Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Elaine)
on SNL.
He can be heard heckling Michael McKean when McKean hosted SNL in 1984, and he can be seen in the sketch "The Run, Throw, and Catch Like a Girl Olympics" when Howard Cosell hosted the season finale in 1985.

In 2008 David made $55 million from Seinfeld syndication, DVD sales, and Curb Your Enthusiasm.

The HBO cable television channel aired Davids 1-hour special, Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm, on October 17, 1999.
This was followed by Curb Your Enthusiasm, a television series on HBO that aired its first episode on October 15, 2000.
The show revisits many of the themes of Seinfeld,
and is improvised from a story outline only several pages long that David writes (as of the 5th season, additional writers were hired).
The actors improvise their dialogue based on the story outline, direction, and their own creativity. David has said that his character in the show, a fictionalized version of himself, is what he would be like in real life if he lacked social awareness and sensitivity.
The characters numerous and frequent social faux pas, misunderstandings, and ironic coincidences are the basis of much of the shows comedy and have led to the entry into the American pop culture lexicon of the expression "Larry David moment", meaning an inadvertently created socially awkward situation.
The basis of the show is the events in Davids life following the fortune he earned from the Seinfeld series; David, semi-retired, strives to live a fulfilled life.
Alongside David is his wife Cheryl (played by Cheryl Hines), his manager and best friend Jeff (played by Jeff Garlin), and Jeffs wife Susie (played by Susie Essman).

Celebrities, including comedians Bob Einstein, Wanda Sykes, and Richard Lewis (comedian) Richard Lewis, appear on the show regularly. Actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen have had recurring roles as themselves.
The show is critically acclaimed and has been nominated for 30 Primetime Emmy Awards, with one win, as well as one Golden Globe win. In the first six seasons, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Jason Alexander appeared in several episodes, and Jerry Seinfeld made a cameo. In season 7, the cast of Seinfeld, including Michael Richards, returned in a story arc involving Davids attempt to organize a Seinfeld reunion special.

On Wednesday, June 2, 2010, the series premiered on the TV Guide Network, making its network television debut. TV Guide Network also produced a series of related discussions with high-profile guest stars, media pundits, and prominent social figures called "Curb: The Discussion" debating the moral implications depicted in each episode. David is quoted as saying "Finally, thanks to the TV Guide Network, Ill get a chance to watch actual, intelligent people discuss and debate the issues addressed on Curb. Now if only someone could tell me where this alleged Network is, I might even watch it."
