James Francis Durante (February 10, 1893&nbsp;– January 29, 1980) was an American singer, pianist, comedian, and actor. His distinctive clipped gravelly speech, Lower East Side Manhattan accent, comic language-butchery, jazz-influenced songs, and prominent nose helped make him one of Americas most familiar and popular personalities of the 1920s through the 1970s. He often referred to his nose as the Schnozzola (from the Yiddish slang word "Schnoz" [big nose]), and the word became his nickname.

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Durante was born on the Lower East Side of New York City. He was the youngest of four children born to Rosa (Lentino) and Bartolomeo Durante, both of whom were immigrants from Salerno, Italy.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rRVRi3_gxfwC&pg=PA7&dq=%22Chapter+2+Beginnings+And+Family+Roots+Durante+grew+%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=b3ixUv7IE4z8yAGhhoC4DQ&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA]</ref> Bartolomeo was a barber.<ref>Fowler, Gene Jr. Schnozzola: The Story of Jimmy Durante Viking Press, 1951</ref><ref>Bakish, David Jimmy Durante: His Show Business Career, with an Annotated Filmography and Discography McFarland & Co., 1994 {{ISBN 978-0-89950-968-6}}</ref> Young Jimmy served as an Altar server#Altar servers in the Catholic Church altar boy at Saint Malachys Roman Catholic Church, known as the Actors Chapel.<ref>{{cite web author=Vincenzo  url=http://www.sanctepater.com/2009/10/actors-chapel.html  title=The Actors’ Chapel &#124; SANCTE PATER  publisher=Sanctepater.blogspot.com  date=2009-10-24  accessdate=2012-05-10}}</ref>

===Early career===
Durante dropped out of school in seventh grade to become a full-time ragtime pianist. He first played with his cousin, whose name was also Jimmy Durante. It was a family act, but he was too professional for his cousin. He continued working the citys piano bar circuit and earned the nickname "Ragtime Jimmy", before he joined one of the first recognizable jazz bands in New York, the Original New Orleans Jazz Band. Durante was the only member not from New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans. His routine of breaking into a song to deliver a joke, with band or orchestra chord punctuation after each line, became a Durante trademark. In 1920 the group was renamed Jimmy Durantes Jazz Band.

Jimmy Durante was a white bandleader who featured black musicians in his live band, such as Achille Baquet, who played and recorded in Durantes Original New Orleans Jazz Band (1918–1920).<ref>{{cite book  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfwfMTWBGgYC&pg=PA183  title=Early Jazz: Its Roots and Musical Development  first=Gunther  last=Schuller  page=183  publisher=Oxford University Press  date=1986  isbn=978-0195040432}}</ref>

==Stardom==
By the mid-1920s, Durante had become a vaudeville star and radio personality in a trio called Clayton, Jackson and Durante. Lou Clayton and Eddie Jackson (vaudeville) Eddie Jackson, Durantes closest friends, often reunited with Durante in subsequent years. Jackson and Durante appeared in the Cole Porter musical The New Yorkers, which opened on Broadway theatre Broadway on December 8, 1930. Earlier that same year, the team appeared in the movie Roadhouse Nights, ostensibly based on Dashiell Hammetts novel Red Harvest.

By 1934, Durante had a major record hit with his own novelty composition, "Inka Dinka Doo", with lyrics by Ben Ryan (composer) Ben Ryan.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.allmusic.com/search/track/Inka+Dinka+Doo/order:default-asc  title=Track Search: Inka Dinka Doo  publisher=AllMusic  date=  accessdate=2012-05-10  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808151814/http://www.allmusic.com/search/track/Inka+Dinka+Doo/order:default-asc  archivedate=2011-08-08  df= }}</ref> It became his theme song for the rest of his life. A year later, Durante starred on Broadway in the Billy Rose stage musical Jumbo (musical) Jumbo.  A scene in which a police officer stopped Durantes character—who was leading a live elephant across the stage—to ask, "What are you doing with that elephant?", followed by Durantes reply, "What elephant?", was a regular show-stopper. This comedy bit, also reprised in his role in Billy Roses Jumbo (film) Billy Roses Jumbo, likely contributed to the popularity of the idiom Elephant in the room#Origins the elephant in the room. Durante also appeared on Broadway in Show Girl (1929 musical) Show Girl (1929), Strike Me Pink (1934) and Red, Hot and Blue (1936).

During the early 1930s, Durante alternated between Hollywood and Broadway. His early motion pictures included an original Rodgers & Hart musical The Phantom President (1932), which featured Durante singing the self-referential Schnozzola.  He was initially paired with silent film legend Buster Keaton in a series of three popular comedies for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Speak Easily (1932), The Passionate Plumber (1932), and What! No Beer? (1933), which were financial hits and a career springboard for the distinctive newcomer.  However, Keatons vociferous dissatisfaction with constraints the studio had placed upon him, his perceived incompatibility with Durantes broad chatty humor, exacerbated by his alcoholism, led the studio to end the series. Durante went on to appear in The Wet Parade (1932), Broadway to Hollywood (1933 film) Broadway to Hollywood (1933), The Man Who Came to Dinner (film) The Man Who Came to Dinner (1942, playing Banjo, a character based on Harpo Marx), Ziegfeld Follies (1946), Billy Roses Jumbo (film) Billy Roses Jumbo (1962, based on the 1935 musical), and Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963). In 1934, he starred in Hollywood Party (1934 film) Hollywood Party, where he dreams he is Schnarzan, a parody of Tarzan who was popular at the time due to the Johnny Weissmuller films.

==Radio==
File:Jimmy durante 1935.JPG thumb upright Durante on The Jumbo Fire Chief Program, 1935.
On September 10, 1933, Durante appeared on Eddie Cantors NBC radio show, The Chase and Sanborn Hour, continuing until November 12 of that year. When Cantor left the show, Durante took over as its star from April 22 to September 30, 1934. He then moved on to The Jumbo Fire Chief Program (1935–36).

Durante teamed with Garry Moore for The Durante-Moore Show in 1943. Durantes comic chemistry with the young, brushcut Moore brought Durante an even larger audience. "Dats my boy dat said dat!" became an instant catchphrase, which would later inspire the cartoon Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy. The duo was one of the nations favorites for the rest of the decade. Their Armed Forces Radio Network Command Performance (radio series) Command Performance<ref>[http://www.otr.net/?p=cmdp Command Performance March 1, 1942 to October 18, 1949 (OTR.NETwork Library)]</ref><ref>[http://www.otr.net/r/cmdp/107.ram Command Performance 1947-02-30, Carole Landis, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Durante (Real Audio)]</ref> with Frank Sinatra remains a favorite of radio-show collectors today. Moore left the duo in mid-1947, and the program returned October 1, 1947 as The Jimmy Durante Show (radio program) The Jimmy Durante Show. Durante continued the show for three more years, and featured a reunion of Clayton, Jackson and Durante on his April 21, 1948 broadcast.

==Television==
Although Durante made his television debut on November 1, 1950 (on the Four Star Revue - see below) he continued to keep a presence in radio, as a frequent guest on Tallulah Bankheads two-year NBC comedy-variety show The Big Show (NBC Radio) The Big Show. Durante was one of the cast on the shows premiere November 5, 1950, along with humorist Fred Allen, singers Mindy Carson and Frankie Laine, stage musical performer Ethel Merman, actors Jose Ferrer and Paul Lukas, and comic-singer Danny Thomas (about to become a major television star in his own right). A highlight of the premiere was Durante and Thomas, whose own nose rivaled Durantes, in a routine in which Durante accused Thomas of stealing his nose. "Stay outta dis, No-Nose!" Durante barked at Bankhead to a big laugh.

From 1950 to 1951, Durante was the host once a month (alternating with Ed Wynn, Danny Thomas and Jack Carson) on Wednesday evenings at 8 p.m, on NBCs comedy-variety series Four Star Revue. Jimmy continued with the show until 1954. 

Durante then had a half-hour variety show - The Jimmy Durante Show - on NBC from October 2, 1954, to June 23, 1956.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046613/  title=The Jimmy Durante Show publisher=Internet Movie Data Base accessdate=November 15, 2010}}</ref>

Beginning in the early 1950s, Durante teamed with sidekick Sonny King (singer) Sonny King, a collaboration that would continue until Durantes death.  He was often seen regularly in Las Vegas after Sunday Mass outside of the Guardian Angel Cathedral standing next to the priest and greeting the people as they left Mass.

Several times in the 1960s, Durante served as host of ABCs Hollywood Palace variety show, which were taped live (and consequently include ad-libs by the seasoned vaudevillian).

His last regular television appearance was co-starring with the Lennon Sisters on "Jimmy Durante Presents the Lennon Sisters Hour" which lasted for one season on ABC (1969–1970).

==Marriages==

Durantes first wife was Jean "Jeanne" Olson, whom he married on June 19, 1921. She was born in Ohio on August 31, 1896. She was 46 years old when she died on Valentines Day in 1943, after a lingering heart ailment of about two years, although different newspaper accounts of her death suggest she was 45 or perhaps 52.<ref>See California Death Records - Jeanne Durante</ref> As her death was not immediately expected, Durante was touring in New York at the time and returned to Los Angeles right away to complete the funeral arrangements.

Durantes radio show was bracketed with two trademarks: "Inka Dinka Doo" as his opening theme, and the invariable signoff that became another familiar national catchphrase: "Good night, Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are."  For years no one knew who Mrs. Calabash referred to and Durante preferred to keep the mystery alive. One theory was that it referred to the owner of a restaurant in Calabash, North Carolina, where Durante and his troupe had stopped to eat. He was so taken by the food, the service, and the chitchat he told the owner that he would make her famous. Since he did not know her name, he referred to her as "Mrs. Calabash".<ref>{{cite book  first=Tod   last=Benoit   coauthors=   title=Jimmy Durante   date=May 6, 2003   publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers   url =https://www.amazon.com/Buried-Fitting-Resting-Infamous-Noteworthy/dp/1579122876   work =Where Are They Buried? How Did They Die? Fitting Ends and Final Resting Places of the Famous, Infamous, and Noteworthy   pages =   language = }}</ref> Another idea was that it was a personal salute to his deceased wife, Jeanne..."Calabash" might have been a mangle of Calabasas, California Calabasas, the California city where they made their home during the last years of her life. His friend and co-star, Candy Candido, (in an interview with Chuck Shadens "Speaking of Radio" in 1988),  reported that he met the actual woman in Chicago when traveling with Durante, but was sworn to keep the secret. Alternatively, Jimmys  friend and radio producer, Phil Cohan revealed to Chuck Shadens Speaking of Radio interview in 1988 that it was a fabrication. Needing a closing to his show, the writers tossed around several names settling on Cohans calabash pipe as the best-sounding moniker.

At a National Press Club (United States) National Press Club meeting in 1966 (broadcast on NBCs Monitor (NBC Radio) Monitor program), Durante finally revealed that it was indeed a tribute to his wife. While driving across the country, they stopped in a small town called Calabash, whose name Jean had loved. "Mrs. Calabash" became his pet name for her, and he signed off his radio program with "Good night, Mrs. Calabash." He added "wherever you are" after the first year.<ref>[http://monitorbeacon.net/sounds/monitor-1975-bw-sat5.mp3 NBC Monitor, January 25, 1975] (sound clip at 48:08) From [http://monitorbeacon.net/ the Monitor Tribute Pages]</ref>

Durante married his second wife, Margaret "Margie" Little, at St. Malachys Catholic Church in New York City on December 14, 1960. As a teenager she had been crowned Queen of the New Jersey State Fair. She attended New York University before being hired by the legendary Copacabana (nightclub) Copacabana in New York City. She and Durante met there 16 years before their marriage, when he performed there and she was a hatcheck girl. She was 41 and he 67 when they married. With help from their attorney, Mary G. Rogan, the couple were able to adopt a baby, Cecilia Alicia (nicknamed CeCe and now known as CeCe Durante-Bloum), on Christmas Day, 1961. CeCe became a champion horsewoman and then a horse trainer and horseback-riding instructor. Margie died on June 7, 2009, at the age of 89.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/lajollalight/obituary.aspx?n=margaret-durante-margie&pid=131282332  title=Margaret "Margie" Durante Obituary: View Margaret Durantes Obituary by La Jolla Light  publisher=Legacy.com  date=  access-date=May 10, 2012}}</ref>

==Charitable work==
On August 15, 1958, for his charitable acts, Durante was awarded a huge three-foot-high brass loving cup by the Al Bahr Shriners Temple. The inscription reads: "JIMMY DURANTE THE WORLDS MOST FAMOUS COMEDIAN. A loving cup to you Jimmy, its larger than your nose, but smaller than your heart. Happiness always, Al Bahr Temple, August 15, 1958."

Durantes love for children continued through the Fraternal Order of Eagles, who among many causes raise money for handicapped and abused children. At Durantes first appearance at the Eagles International Convention in 1961, Judge Bob Hansen inquired about his fee for performing. Durante replied, "Do not even mention money judge or Ill have to mention a figure thatll make ya sorry ya brought it up." "What can we do then?" asked Hansen. "Help da kids," was Durantes reply. Durante performed for many years at Eagles conventions free of charge, even refusing travel money. The Fraternal Order of Eagles changed the name of their childrens fund to the Jimmy Durante Childrens Fund in his honor, and in his memory have raised over 20 million dollars to help children. A reporter once remarked of Durante after an interview: "You could warm your hands on this one." One of the projects built using money from the Durante Fund was a heated therapy swimming pool at the Hughen School in Port Arthur, Texas. Completed in 1968, Durante named the pool the "Inka Dinka Doo Pool".

==Politics==
Durante was an active member of the Democratic Party (United States) Democratic Party. In 1933, he appeared in an advertisement shown in theaters supporting Franklin D. Roosevelts New Deal programs and wrote a musical score entitled Give a Guy a Job to accompany it. He performed at both the inaugural gala for President John Kennedy in 1961 and a year later at the famous Madison Square Garden rally for the Democratic party that featured Marilyn Monroe singing "Happy Birthday" to JFK.<ref>{{cite web author=  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jiUu8od_I8  title=Give a Man a Job - 1933  publisher=YouTube  date=January 30, 2009  access-date=May 10, 2012}}</ref>

==Later years==

Durante continued his film appearances through Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and television appearances through the early 1970s. He narrated the Rankin-Bass animated Christmas special Frosty the Snowman (TV program) Frosty the Snowman (1969), re-run for many years since. The television work also included a series of commercial spots for Kelloggs Corn Flakes cereals in the mid-1960s, which introduced Durantes gravelly growl and narrow-eyed, large-nosed countenance to millions of children. "Dis is Jimmy Durante, in puy-son!" was his introduction to some of the Kelloggs spots. One of his last appearances was in a memorable television commercial for the 1973 Volkswagen Beetle, where he proclaimed that the new, roomier Beetle had "plenty of breathin room... for de old schnozzola!"

In 1963, Durante recorded the album of pop standards September Song. The album became a best-seller and provided Durantes re-introduction to yet another generation, almost three decades later. From the Jimmy Durantes Way of Life album came the gravelly interpretation of the song "As Time Goes By (song) As Time Goes By", which accompanied the opening credits of the romantic comedy hit Sleepless in Seattle, while his version of "Make Someone Happy" launched the films closing credits. Both are included on the films best-selling soundtrack. Durante also recorded a cover of the well known song Ill Be Seeing You (song) Ill Be Seeing You, which became a trademark song on his 60s TV show. This song was also featured in the 2004 film The Notebook (2004 film) The Notebook.

He wrote a foreword for a humorous book compiled by Dick Hyman entitled Cockeyed Americana. In the first paragraph of the "Foreword!, as Durante called it, he describes meeting Hyman and discussing the book and the contribution that Hyman wanted Durante to make to it. Durante wrote, "Before I can say gaziggadeegasackeegazobbath, were at his luxurious office." After reading the material Hyman had compiled for the book, Durante commented on it, "COLOSSAL, GIGANTIC, MAGNANIMOUS, and last but not first, AURORA BOREALIS. [Capitalization Durantes] Four little words that make a sentence—and a sentence that will eventually get me six months."

Durante contributed numerous catchphrase catch-phrases to popular vernacular: "Dats my boy dat said dat!"; "Dats moral turpentine!"; "Its a catastastroke!" (for "catastrophe"); "Everybody wants ta get inta the act!"; "Umbriago!"; "Ha-cha-cha-chaaaaaaa!"; "I got a million of em"; "Surrounded by assassins!"; "Am I mortified!" {{citation needed date=December 2013}}

Durante retired from performing in 1972 after he became wheelchair-bound following a stroke. He died of pneumonia in Santa Monica, California on January 29, 1980, twelve days before he would have turned 87. He received Roman Catholic funeral rites four days later, with fellow entertainers including Desi Arnaz, Ernest Borgnine, Marty Allen (comedian) Marty Allen, and Jack Carter (comedian) Jack Carter in attendance, and was interred at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, California Culver City.<ref>"Durante Family and Friends attend Funeral Rite", The New York Times, April 2, 1980, p. 13.</ref>

==Animation==
Jimmy Durante is known to most modern audiences as the character who narrated and sang the 1969 animated special Frosty the Snowman (TV program) Frosty the Snowman. He also performed the Ron Goodwin title song to the 1968 comedy-adventure Monte Carlo or Bust (titled Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies in the U.S.) sung over the films animated opening credits. There are numerous Durante depictions and allusions in animation. A character in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer M-G-M cartoons, a bulldog named Spike, whose puppy son was always getting caught by accident in the middle of Tom and Jerrys activities, referenced Durante with a raspy voice and an affectionate "Dats my boy!" In another Tom and Jerry short, a starfish lands on Toms head, giving him a big nose. He then proceeds with Durantes famous "Ha-cha-cha-cha" call. The 1943 Tex Avery cartoon "Whats Buzzin Buzzard" featured a vulture with a voice that sounded like Jimmy Durante. A Durante-like voice (originally by Doug Young (voice actor) Doug Young) was also given to the father beagle, Doggie Daddy, in Hanna-Barberas Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy cartoons, Doggie Daddy invariably addressing the junior beagle with a Durante-like "Augie, my son, my son", and with frequent citations of, "Thats my boy who said that!" The 1945 MGM cartoon Jerky Turkey featured a turkey which was a caricature of Durante.

Many Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons had characters based on Durante. One Harman-Ising short from 1933, Boskos Picture Show, featured a caricature of Adolf Hitler chasing Durante with a meat cleaver. Two examples from the 1940s include A Gruesome Twosome, which features a cat based on Durante, and Baby Bottleneck, which in unedited versions opens with a Durante-like stork. Book Revue shows the well-known (at that time) 1924 Edna Ferber novel So Big (novel) So Big featuring a Durante caricature on the cover. The "so big" refers to his nose, and as a runaway criminal turns the corner by the book, Durante turns sideways using his nose to trip the criminal, allowing his capture. In Hollywood Daffy, Durante is directly depicted as himself, pronouncing his catchphrase "Those are the conditions that prevail!" In The Mouse-Merized Cat, Catstello (a Lou Costello mouse) is briefly hypnotized to imitate Jimmy Durante singing Lullaby of Broadway (song) Lullaby of Broadway. One of Durantes common catch phrases, "I got a million of em!", was used as Bugs final line in Stage Door Cartoon.

A Durante-like voice was also used for Marvel Comics superhero Thing (comics) The Thing in the Hanna-Barbera cartoon Fred and Barney Meet the Thing. The voice and appearance of Crispy, the mascot for Crispy Critters cereal, was also based on Durante.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130209193924/http://www.x-entertainment.com/articles/0725/ X-Entertainment: Crispy Critters Cereal Tribute<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In Disneys House of Mouse, a character named Mortimer Mouse (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) was based on Durante, complete with the "ha-cha-cha!". One of the main characters in Terrytoons Heckle and Jeckle cartoon series also takes to imitating Jimmy in 1948s Taming The Cat ("Get a couple of song birds today...").
