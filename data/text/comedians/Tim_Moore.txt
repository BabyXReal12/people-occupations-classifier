===Television stardom===
<!-- Deleted image removed: File:AmosAndy.jpg left 250px thumb Alvin Childress, Tim Moore, and Spencer Williams in a CBS publicity shot for the program, 1951. -->
In 1950, Moore was recommended by his old vaudeville friend, Flournoy Miller, for the role of George "Kingfish" Stevens, a role which was voiced on radio by white actor Freeman Gosden.<ref name="Harlem"/>  He was called out of retirement by the Columbia Broadcasting System to star in a new television adaptation of Amos n Andy.<ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jncxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Yn0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3569,1199892&dq=freeman+gosden&hl=en title=Amos And Andy Name Subs For Television Roles date=June 18, 1951 publisher=St. Petersburg Times accessdate=October 11, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZCNWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=u-IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6812,6572779&dq=spencer+williams&hl=en title=Radios Veteran Comics Smash Hit on Television date=April 14, 1954 publisher=Eugene Register-Guard accessdate=March 12, 2011}}</ref>  As the radio series had developed in prior years, the scheming but henpecked Kingfish had become the central focus of most of the plots. In the television version, Moore played the character more broadly, with louder and more forceful delivery and a distinctive Georgia drawl, exaggerated for comic effect. Moores Kingfish dominated the calmer and soft-spoken "Amos n Andy" characters. Early in his career, Moore had developed a "con-man" routine he used for many years while in vaudeville; re-working some aspects of his old act produced the television character Kingfish.<ref name="Harlem"/>

Moore was very popular in the show and for the first time in his career became a national celebrity as well as the first African American to win stardom on television. When leaving a train in Albuquerque to buy some Native American pottery, the proprietor recognized him immediately, saying, "You, you Kingfish." This was the first time it happened in Moores 52 years in show business.<ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4ccKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hU8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3384,3553696&dq=tim+moore&hl=en title=The Lyons Den author=Lyons, Leonard date=August 11, 1951 publisher=St. Petersburg Times accessdate=October 16, 2010}}</ref> The show aired on prime-time TV from June 1951 to June 1953. Although quite popular, the series was eventually canceled due to complaints about ethnic stereotyping. Shortly after the television show left the air, there were plans to turn it into a vaudeville act in August 1953, with Moore, Williams, and Childress playing the same characters.<ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i3ZGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fuUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2121,173955&dq=spencer+williams&hl=en title=Amos n Andy Set for Vaude date=August 4, 1953 publisher=Baltimore Afro-American accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref>  It is not known if this was ever realized. After the series was canceled, it was shown in Broadcast syndication syndication until 1966 when increasing condemnation and pressure from the NAACP persuaded the shows owners (CBS, which still owns the copyrights) to withdraw it from further exhibition.  It was resurrected in the early days of home videotape through public domain video dealers who had acquired episodes from collectors of used 16mm TV prints, although the copyright was never in the public domain. Illegally produced copies continue to be sold over the internet.  The series itself would not be seen on a regular basis again until independent network Rejoice TV began re-airing episodes in 2012.

Many of the episodes revolved around Moores Kingfish character, supported by Ernestine Wade as his level-headed, emotionally strong wife Sapphire, and Amanda Randolph as his openly aggressive mother-in-law, without the participation of Amos or Andy. These Kingfish-only episodes were originally produced as a spinoff series, The Adventures of Kingfish, which made its debut on CBS on January 4, 1955 but lasted only a few episodes.<ref>{{cite book url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SrIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60&dq=tim+moore+intitle:jet&hl=en&ei=7XKyTPS8AZnLngfyw9nuBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCgQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=tim%20moore%20intitle%3Ajet&f=false title=New Kingfish Series To Make TV Debut Jan. 4 date=January 6, 1955 publisher=Jet accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV2gZKvQwR0C&pg=PT223&dq=ernestine+wade&hl=en&ei=3fUzTf3zMMSp8Aa0vJD3CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCTgo#v=onepage&q=ernestine%20wade&f=false title=Make Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America editor-last=Kantor editor-first=Michael editor2-last=Maslon editor2-first=Lawrence year=2008 publisher=Twelve pages=384 isbn=978-0-446-50531-4 accessdate=March 17, 2011}}</ref>  When the Amos n Andy half-hours went into syndication, the Adventures of Kingfish shows were added to the syndicated package under the Amos n Andy series title.

In 1956, Moore and his fellow cast mates Spencer Williams (actor) Spencer Williams, Alvin Childress and Lillian Randolph with her choir, tried a tour of personal appearances as "The TV Stars of Amos n Andy".  The tour was halted by CBS, who viewed this as infringing on their exclusivity.<ref name="Tragedy">{{cite book url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4uK_KEF-KT8C&pg=PA66&dq=all+about+amos+n+andy&hl=en&ei=2FShTKjXEdP_nQfR7L2IBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=all%20about%20amos%20n%20andy&f=false title=The Tragedy of Amos n Andy author=Clayton, Edward T. date=October 1961 publisher=Ebony accessdate=September 27, 2010}}</ref> Moore, and fellow cast members Williams, Childress and Lee, were able to perform for one night in 1957 in Windsor, Ontario, since legal action had not been taken against them in Canada.<ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BSM_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=2k8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=3663,3973138&dq=spencer+williams&hl=en title=The Theatre and its People author=Gardiner, John date=June 25, 1957 publisher=The Windsor Daily Star accessdate=March 12, 2011}}</ref>

When the police arrived at the home, Moore, pistol still in his belt, told them, "Im the old Kingfish, boys. Im the one you want. I fired that shot. I didnt want to hit anyone, although I could have.

When the story broke, local television personality and columnist Paul Coates invited Tim Moore to appear on his KTTV television show; Moore explained the situation in two guest appearances. Coates was promptly taken to task for Moores appearances on his show by Stanley Robertson, a journalist for the African-American newspaper, the Los Angeles Sentinel, calling Moore "disgraceful" and labeling the two shows with Moore as "televisions darkest hour." Coates replied to his critic in his January 29, 1958 Los Angeles Times column, calling Moore "a pretty wonderful, sincere man" and saying he strongly resented Robertsons attack on him.<ref name="Beef"/>

Because of the "Roast Beef Scandal," Moore was once more in demand and even received a testimonial tribute dinner from the Friars Club of Beverly Hills, and appearing on The Tonight Show with Jack Paar.<ref>{{cite book url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA30&dq=tim+moore+intitle:jet&hl=en&ei=7XKyTPS8AZnLngfyw9nuBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCQQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&q=tim%20moore%20intitle%3Ajet&f=false title=Words Of The Week date=January 23, 1958 publisher=Jet accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref>  The publicity also won him an extended performance engagement at the legendary Mocambo (nightclub) Mocambo nightclub.<ref name="Tim"/>

===Death and legacy===
Moore died at age 71 on December 13, 1958 of pulmonary tuberculosis in Los Angeles, four days after his birthday.  There was no money to pay for his hospital care or for his funeral, Moore having received his final $65.00 residual payment from Amos n Andy in January 1958.  At one time, Moore had made $700 per week.<ref name="Married"/><ref>{{cite book url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60&dq=tim+moore+intitle:jet&hl=en&ei=_GyyTPaUGIyJnQeOreH7BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=tim%20moore%20intitle%3Ajet&f=false title=Critically Ill, Kingfish Tells Wife Of Fears, Disappointments date=December 18, 1958 publisher=Jet accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=csMlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MfUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=877%2C7527195 title=Kingfish Succumbs date=December 16, 1958 publisher=Baltimore Afro-American accessdate=November 11, 2010}}</ref>
