==Early and personal life==
Blake grew up in the Melbourne suburb of Glen Waverley. He is a middle child; his older brother, Lachlan, is a solicitor and his sister, Sophie, has completed an arts degree. His parents, Noel and Kerry, separated when Blake was 17, with his father eventually remarrying. As a child, Blake says he was a fan of British comedy such as Monty Python, Fawlty Towers and Blackadder; as a teenager he "worshipped" comedians Tony Martin (comedian) Tony Martin and Mick Molloy. Blake was a member of the National Boys Choir of Australia during the late 1980s. He attended primary school at Glen Waverley South Primary, high school at Caulfield Grammar School and later at St Leonards College (Melbourne) St Leonards College, graduating in 1999.<ref name="boy wonder">{{cite web  author=Fynes-Clinton, Matthew   url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,22729528-7642,00.html   title=Hamish Blake, boy wonder  work=Courier Mail  date=10 November 2007   accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref>

After a gap year, Blake enrolled at the University of Melbourne in a Science/Commerce double degree.  "Im interested in artificial intelligence and computer science. That stuff still fascinates me," he says. However, a few weeks into the semester, he met Andy Lee (comedian) Andy Lee: "That was the turning point. The wheels quickly fell off my academic career."  Blake eventually dropped out of university to pursue a career in comedy alongside Lee. Blakes first experience with comedy was when he entered a competition at university. He was broke at the time, and hoped to win the $500 first prize. His stand-up performance earned him third place and qualified him for a statewide universities final, which he did win.<ref name="boy wonder" />

Blake has five tattoos on his upper left arm. One is of a small anchor to symbolise his and Lees trip on a tall ship to Tasmania, which was modified by placing the letters FR to the left of the anchor producing the phonetic sound Franchor in honour of Frank Stallones Birthday. During the Perth show of the Thank You Tour Blake revealed the letters TH situated above the anchor to produce the phonetic sound "Thanchor" in thanks to the listeners of the show for the past five years. Another of a frog smoking a joint on a skateboard, which was designed and tattooed by Pink (singer) Pink,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.fox.com.au/shows/hamishandandy/photos/pink-tattoos-hamish title=Fox FM publisher=}}</ref> as well as the Olympic rings to symbolise the Hamish & Andy (radio show)#Bi-Bi-Tri-Bi-athlon Bi-Bi-Tri-Bi-athlon. The fourth tattoo is THURS 8:30 (the time-slot of his show, Hamish and Andys Gap Year) which utilises the TH previously tattooed.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.hamishandandy.com/2011/tattoos-dont-hurt/ title=Tattoos don’t hurt - Hamish & Andy first=Hamish & last=Andy publisher=}}</ref> In November, 2016, he received his final tattoo, two crossed drumsticks to commenarate his tour with band, Coolboys and the Frontman, each drumstick was tattooed by a fellow member of the band.

Hamish Blake has collaborated with fellow comedian Andy Lee as the duo Hamish and Andy since 2003, when they performed their breakout show at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, a stage production about a trip they had taken to North Queensland in Blakes old car. Soon after, they trained with Student Youth Network SYN Radio, gaining a drive-time shift, and created a show called Radio Karate for RMITV on community-access television station Channel 31 (Australia) Channel 31, which they created in collaboration with Ryan Shelton and several other school friends. Radio Karate won an Antenna Award for best comedy program at the inaugural National Community Television Awards in February 2004, and one month later were offered a national comedy program on Australias Seven Network.<ref name="nancarrow" />

The Hamish and Andy Show premiered on the Seven Network in March 2005, but failed to achieve ratings success and was cancelled after two weeks. Reviewers acknowledged the duos talent, but criticised the show as "poorly executed".<ref name="nancarrow">{{cite web  author=Nancarrow, Cate   url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/culture/hamish-amp-andy/2007/04/02/1175366136794.html   title=Hamish & Andy  work=The Age  date=2 April 2007   accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref> Blake says that while working on the show was a fun experience, they had little control over what happened and the way it went forward.<ref name="box">{{cite web  author=AAP   url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Comics-Hamish-and-Andy-back-on-the-box/2006/08/14/1155407730981.html   title=Comics Hamish and Andy back on the box  work=The Age  date=14 August 2006   accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref> Following the cancellation of The Hamish and Andy Show, they created a short mockumentary titled The Greystone 2800 about a couple who accidentally bought an open display home after failing to read the fine print on a housing purchase. The film won the Melbourne Comedy Festival Short Film competition and attracted the attention of comedian Rove McManus. This led to some small spots on McManus Network Ten show Rove (TV series) Rove Live.<ref name="nancarrow" />

McManuss company, Roving Enterprises, also helped the duo develop Real Stories, a mock current affairs show that aired on Network Ten in 2006.<ref name="nancarrow" /> Blake says that the experience of creating Real Stories was much more enjoyable than The Hamish and Andy Show because they had greater control over the series. Blake and Lee wrote, acted, directed, filmed and produced the show with input from Ryan Shelton and Tim Bartley.<ref name="box" />

In 2006, Blake and Lee debuted a national drive-time radio show titled Hamish & Andy on the Today Network. The show quickly gained popularity, finishing 2006 with almost one million Melbourne listeners, ahead of 3AWs popular radio host Derryn Hinch.<ref name="nancarrow" /> As of August 2008, Blake and Lees show was rating number one in four out of Australias five major capital cities.<ref>{{cite web  author=Hogan, Jesse   url=http://business.theage.com.au/business/austereo-confident-that-radio-advertising-will-grow-20080825-427c.html   title=Austereo confident that radio advertising will grow  work=The Age  date=26 August 2008   accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref> As of the beginning of 2009, the show is broadcast in all capital cities as well as many regional centres across the country.
