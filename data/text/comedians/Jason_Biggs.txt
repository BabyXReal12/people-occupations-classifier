==Career==

Biggs began acting at the age of five. In 1991, he made his television debut in the short lived Fox Broadcasting Company FOX series Drexells Class. In 1988, he received his Screen Actors Guild card for appearing in a TV commercial for Pathmark. He later recalled in a 2015 interview in TV Guide, "I remember I had to eat a doughnut in one of the shots. Over and over again. Awesome."<ref>Moynihan, Rob (January 19, 2015). "How I Got My Screen Actors Guild SAG-AFTRA Card", TV Guide. p. 8</ref>

When Biggs was 12, he starred in a one-off HBO special, The Fotis Sevastakis Story, but due to licensing arguments, it was never aired. That same year, Biggs debuted on Broadway theatre Broadway in Conversations with My Father with Judd Hirsch.<ref>Biggs, Jason (August 1, 2012).

Backstage (magazine) Backstage.</ref> He then starred in the daytime soap opera, As the World Turns, for which he was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Best Younger Actor.{{citation needed date=January 2015}}

Biggs attended New York University briefly from 1996–1997, but soon afterwards, he returned to pursue acting. And so he would be seen again in another short lived television series, 1997s Camp Stories. He then starred in American Pie (film) American Pie, which went on to become an international hit that has spawned three sequels (also starring Biggs) and four spinoffs (that did not star Biggs). After that, Biggs accepted starring roles in movies such as Loser (film) Loser in 2000, and others. In 2001, Biggs starred in the comedy Saving Silverman. He appeared in the 2002 Broadway production of The Graduate as Benjamin Braddock alongside  Kathleen Turner and Alicia Silverstone. In 2003, Biggs appeared as Jerry Falk in the Woody Allen romantic comedy Anything Else. In the 2004–2005 season Biggs portrayed an Orthodox Judaism Orthodox Jew in Daniel Goldfarbs comedy, Modern Orthodox, staged at Dodger Stages theater in New York City. In 2006, Biggs was seen in the MTV reality show Blowin Up with Jamie Kennedy and Stu Stone which led to his participation in a hip-hop recording with Bay Area rapper E-40. Biggs returned to the stage in the fall of 2008 in Howard Korders Boys Life at New York Citys Second Stage Theatre.

Biggs has appeared in several other films, including Texas Rangers (film) Texas Rangers and Over Her Dead Body.

In 2012, he contributed to the anthology, Oy! Only Six? Why Not More: Six-Word Memoirs on Jewish Life.

He departed the series in February 2015 after two seasons.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/02/20/jason-biggs-not-returning-orange-new-black-season-3  title=Jason Biggs not returning for Orange Is the New Black season 3 newspaper=Entertainment Weekly date=February 22, 2015}}</ref>
