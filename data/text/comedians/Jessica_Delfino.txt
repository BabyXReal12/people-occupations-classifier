==Controversy==

On December 19, 2006, Catholic League (U.S.) Catholic League president William A. Donohue publicly attacked Delfinos act, asserting that it "provides ammunition" to Muslim terrorists by "harboring a depraved understanding of liberty."<ref>[http://www.catholicleague.org/christmas-season-marked-by-obscenities-2/ "Christmas Season Marked by Obscenities"] Catholic League Press Release, December 19, 2006</ref>  In response, Delfino stated, "I was brought up Catholic, and I was also brought up to believe that it isnt anti-Catholic to celebrate the life-giving and life-nurturing parts of a woman’s body.  I don’t know why William Donohue hates women’s bodies.  I don’t know why he is afraid of refocusing attention on humanitys true source of creation, the mysterious and magical womb.  But I do know that William Donohue is a hypocrite and a bigot, who has publicly made outrageous and highly-offensive anti-Semitic, and now anti-Muslim statements.  And that certainly doesnt make him a better Catholic than I am.  William Donohue does not speak for all Catholics.  He doesnt speak for me."<ref>[http://jessydelfino.blogspot.com/2006/12/for-immediate-release-nyc-artist.html "NYC ARTIST RESPONDS TO CATHOLIC LEAGUE’S ATTACK"] Jessica Delfinos Press release, December 21, 2006</ref>
