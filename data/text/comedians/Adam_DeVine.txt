==Early life==
DeVine was born in Waterloo, Iowa,
the son of Dennis and Penny DeVine.
He graduated from Millard South High School in Omaha, Nebraska, in 2002.{{citation needed date=September 2016}}

He attended Orange Coast College, along with friend and fellow cast member Blake Anderson.
He later moved to Los Angeles, where he began working as a stand up comedian and actor.
===1995 accident===
In June 1995, when he was 11 years old, DeVine was walking his bike across a street in Omaha, Nebraska. After he waited for three cement trucks to pass, a fourth truck, previously blocked by opposing traffic, struck him. DeVine went under the first two wheels of the 42 ton cement truck and slid 500 feet. He was knocked unconscious, went into acute shock and was in a coma. He was rushed to intensive care, where he woke up two weeks later. He broke all the bones in both legs, had a collapsed lung, developed multiple infections, and it was unknown whether he would ever walk again. Over several years, he had 26 surgeries and spent much of the time using a wheelchair. Due to the extent of his injuries, DeVine was at very high risk of having to have his legs amputated, and having multiple organ failure. He regained full mobility but still has extensive scarring on his legs.
"It was really tough because I had to relearn how to walk, stand up, sit up and everything," DeVine described. "The legs were totally mangled. I think that experience helped me realize that anything is possible."
To pass the time DeVine called into his local radio station and impersonated celebrities to entertain himself and others. Upon returning to school, DeVine experienced bullying, but told jokes as a way to deflect attention away from his injuries. All this, he said, contributed to how he saw comedy as a way of bringing people together. It was later discovered that the reason he was not killed was because his bike was on his right side, and thus took the full force of the truck.
==Career==
In 2006, DeVine and friends Blake Anderson, Anders Holm, and Kyle Newacheck formed the sketch-comedy group Mail Order Comedy.
