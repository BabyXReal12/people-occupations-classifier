==Career==

===1980s===

Sadowitz made his comedy debut in 1983 at a Glasgow club and secured a regular stand-up slot at the Weavers Inn pub on London Road in Glasgow. The pub was run by future comedian Janey Godley, and he got the gig after her brother Jim begged her to put him on.<ref name="heraldscotland2"/><ref>{{cite web last=Donaldson  first=Brian  url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/39446-janey-godley-my-comedy-hero-jerry-sadowitz/  title=Janey Godley: My comedy hero - Jerry Sadowitz  publisher=The List  date=2012-01-05  accessdate=2016-10-26}}</ref> Sadowitz began travelling down to London to perform at The Comedy Store every two weeks for two years, making the 400+ mile journey via Stagecoach Group Stagecoach express coach. He moved to the city permanently in 1986, living with his mother in Hampstead until 2005.<ref name="thefreelibrary1"/><ref name="heraldscotland1"/><ref name="thefreelibrary2">{{cite web url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/IM+TOO+MAD+TO+GET+THERAPY%3B+Why+anger+management+is+out+for+Jerry...-a0130107519  title=Im Too Mad to Get Therapy — Why anger management is out for Jerry Sadowitz Exclusive  publisher=thefreelibrary.com  date=  accessdate=2016-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-interviews/2011/03/20/incendiary-comedian-jerry-sadowitz-lets-loose-on-fame-fortune-and-failure-86908-23003611/  title=Incendiary comedian Jerry Sadowitz lets loose on fame, fortune and failure - The Daily Record  publisher=Web.archive.org  date=2011-03-20  accessdate=2016-10-26  deadurl=bot: unknown  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325200611/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-interviews/2011/03/20/incendiary-comedian-jerry-sadowitz-lets-loose-on-fame-fortune-and-failure-86908-23003611/  archivedate=25 March 2011  df= }}</ref> There, he began his first job working in Selfridges.<ref>{{cite journal url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60469322.html title=Uncovering the magic of Jerry.(Features) date=12 February 1999 publisher= accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref>

In the early days Sadowitz was managed by anarchic comedian and club proprietor Malcolm Hardee, whose provocative selling line for Sadowitz was that he was too shocking to appear on TV; this may have actively put off TV producers from booking him. As a bet with fellow comic Nick Revell, he produced one of his most famous lines of that era: "Nelson Mandela, what a cunt. Terry Waite, fucking bastard. I dunno, you lend some people a fiver, you never see them again."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/comment/articles/2010-02/02/james-mullinger-jerry-sadowitz  title=The return of Jerry Sadowitz  first=James  last=Mullinger  work=GQ Magazine  date=2 February 2010  deadurl=bot: unknown  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001042829/http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/comment/articles/2010-02/02/james-mullinger-jerry-sadowitz  archivedate= 1 October 2011  df= }}</ref> For a time Sadowitz was considered part of the alternative comedy movement, but his act proved too un-PC with the Guardian stating that Sadowitz "shook up the right-on values of the 80s alternative comedy circuit with his willingness to say the unsayable".<ref>{{cite web author=James Kettle  url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/09/jerry-sadowitz-interview  title=Jerry Sadowitz: his dark materials &#124; Stage  publisher=The Guardian  date=  accessdate=2016-10-26}}</ref>

Sadowitzs 1987 Edinburgh Fringe show Total Abuse was filmed at the Assembly Rooms and also released as an audio release in the form of the album Gobshite.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.discogs.com/Jerry-Sadowitz-Gobshite/release/2493434  title=Jerry Sadowitz - Gobshite (Vinyl, LP) at Discogs  publisher=Discogs.com  date=2014-12-19  accessdate=2016-10-26}}</ref> The album was quickly withdrawn from sale due to fears of being sued for libel by Jimmy Savile as Sadowitz references rumours of the TV personality being a paedophile. Following Saviles death in 2011, a Jimmy Savile#Sexual assault allegations police investigation into his alleged activities began. An article in the Daily Mail referred to the Sadowitz accusation.<ref>{{cite web last=Samuel  first=Martin  url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2216358/Jimmy-Savile-allegations-Why-did-listen-Jerry-Sadowitzs-howl-rage.html  title=Jimmy Savile allegations: Why did no one listen to Jerry Sadowitzs howl of rage? &#124; Daily Mail Online  publisher=Dailymail.co.uk  date=  accessdate=2016-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.anorak.co.uk/336013/celebrities/jerry-sadowitz-was-right-about-jimmy-savile.html title=Jerry Sadowitz was right about Jimmy Savile publisher=Anorak.co.uk accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref>

After a brief run as a columnist for Time Out (company) Time Out magazine, he embarked on the Lose Your Comic Virginity tour in 1989.<ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dDNAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RVkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3543,1483289&dq title=No laughing matter as comics pull no punchlines last=Young first=Andrew work=Glasgow Herald date=18 August 1989}}</ref> At this time he was how being managed by Jon Thodays fledgling Avalon Entertainment Ltd. The tour culminated in a show at the Dominion Theatre in London, the climax of which was an illusion in which he appeared from the rear of the auditorium wearing a kilt and a huge plastic phallus from which he proceeded to spray the audience.

===1990s===
In 1991, Sadowitz was knocked unconscious by an irate audience member during a performance at the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal, where he mocked French Canadians, starting with the greeting "Hello moosefuckers! I tell you why I hate Canada, half of you speak French, and the other half let them."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.mysticgames.com/famouspeople/JerrySadowitz.htm title=Jerry Sadowitz publisher=Mystic Games accessdate=10 September 2009}}</ref> The rarely quoted follow up line, which Sadowitz claims is what actually led to him being attacked was "Why dont you speak Indian?

In 1992, Sadowitz appeared in his own television show The Pall Bearers Revue. This name was taken from an old magic magazine. This show attracted a record number of complaints and has never been repeated.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0755634/bio  title=Jerry Sadowitz – Biography publisher=IMDb.com accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> A typical joke on it was: "Its funny, why do you never hear anyone say the word cunt on TV?" In the same year, he appeared in the music video of The Shamens UK number 1 hit "Ebeneezer Goode". Sadowitz later expressed regret over his appearance in the video, stating that "it shows how stupid I am. I didnt even know that song was about drugs. I dont take drugs and had I known I wouldnt have done it".<ref name="thefreelibrary2"/> He also befriended Derren Brown, who he met whilst working the International Magic shop in Clerkenwell, London.<ref name="scotsman1"/><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/learn-magic-with-jerry-sadowitz-new-classes-added title=Learn magic with Jerry Sadowitz publisher= accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref> He helped Brown in his early career by putting him in touch with H&R publishers and Objective Productions, a production company founded by the television magician Andrew OConnor (actor) Andrew OConnor.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3591160/Can-this-man-read-minds.html title=Can this man read minds? first=John last=Preston publisher= accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=https://derrenbrowninfo.co.uk/interviews/magic_cafe_interview/ title=TheMagicCafe.com Interview, September 2004 - Derren Brown publisher= accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/interviews/2006/07/13/3542/not_up_to_his_old_tricks title=Interviews 2006 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide first=Powder Blue Internet Business last=Solutions publisher= accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref> which led to his breakthrough show Mind Control in 2000.

Between 1994 and 1998, Sadowitz performed as part of the double act Bib & Bob with Logan Murray. His work with Murray took the form of sketches aimed at alienating almost everyone, with the duo stamping on a blow-up doll of the recently deceased Linda McCartney, and tipping Murray, dressed as Superman, out of a wheelchair into the audience (a reference to the paralysis of Christopher Reeve). At one show, Sadowitz spat in the face of a drunken heckler who was constantly interrupting the show. His final act was to strip naked and run across the stage, prompting a mixture of disgust and hilarity from the audience.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy--not-at-all-bad-gerry-sadowitz-has-been-lying-low-for-a-while-now-hes-back-quieter-than-ever-james-rampton-breathed-a-sigh-of-relief-1422766.html title=Not at all bad: Gerry Sadowitz has been lying low for a while.

In 1998, Sadowitz joined the newly launched Channel 5 (UK) Channel 5, hosting his own panel show, The People vs. Jerry Sadowitz. The show featured Sadowitz sitting at a desk inviting members of the audience to join him and talk about a topic close to their heart and trying to get Sadowitz to agree with them. If they succeeded in winning Sadowitz over, they were invited back at the end of the show for a chance to compete for a £10,000 cash prize. If Sadowitz was not convinced or became bored during the audience members time, he would ring a bell on the desk signalling for the shows resident bouncer Dave Courtney to escort them from the stage. Contestants on the show were regularly verbally abused by Sadowitz, and over the course of the series no one managed to win the cash prize. The show led to the channel being reprimanded by the Broadcasting Standards Commission, after they concluded that the repeated use of the F and C words "had a cumulative effect that was both excessive and unnecessary".<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12334919.Sadowitz_reprimand/ title=Sadowitz reprimand publisher= accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref> In the same year, a full-frontal nude shot of Sadowitz appeared in Esquire magazine as part of a 14-page "uncensored sex special".<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NAKED%20FURY;%20Row%20as%20X-rated%20pictures%20go%20on%20sale%20in%20Irish%20shops.-a060669033 title=Naked Fury — Row as X-rated pictures go on sale in Irish shops publisher=thefreelibrary.com accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref> Despite the reprimand, Sadowitz continued to work with Channel 5, co-presenting The Jerry Atrick Show between 2000 and 2002.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b85978c09 title=The Jerry Atrick Show[17/12/2000] (2000) publisher= accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref>

===2000–present===

In the early 2000s, Sadowitz began performing close-up magic shows in small venues, where the focus was on the tricks and the offensive patter forming an incidental, yet still angry and obscene, part of the act.

In 2005, Sadowitz performed two separate shows at that years Edinburgh Fringe, a stand up comedy show (Not For The Easily Offended) at The Queens Hall and Jerry Sadowitz – Card Tricks & Close Up Magic at The Assembly Rooms. The comedy show included a character named "Rabbi Burns", a cross between a Jew and Robert Burns the famous Scottish poet. He performed a similar series of shows at the Soho Theatre in London between December 2006 and January 2007.

In 2006 he toured his "Equal Opportunities Offender" show<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/950289.Jerry_Sadowitz___Equal_Oportunities_Offender__Corn_Exchange__Brighton__Sunday__October_8/?ref=arc title=Jerry Sadowitz - Equal Opportunities Offender, Corn Exchange, Brighton, Sunday, October 8 publisher= accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref> and broke the Soho box office record for ticket sales when he performed his close up magic show at the Soho Theatre.<ref>{{cite news  first=Domonic  last=Maxwell  title=Jerry Sadowitz work=The Times  date=15 August 2007  accessdate= }}</ref>
In 2007, he performed his Edinburgh Festival show "Comedian, Magician, Psychopath" to a sold out crowd at the Underbelly.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2007/jerry-sadowitz-comedian-magician-psychopath-review-at-underbelly-udderbelly-edinburgh/ title=Jerry Sadowitz - Comedian, Magician, Psychopath review at Underbelly Udderbelly Edinburgh - Review - Theatre - The Stage publisher= accessdate=26 October 2016}}</ref>

In March 2008 as part of the Glasgow Comedy Festival, Sadowitz sold out the Theatre Royal, Glasgow Theatre Royal. He performed the show "Comedian, Magician, Psychopath 2: Because I Still Have to Pay the Rent" at the Edinburgh Comedy Festival in 2008. In this show he celebrated the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, making stereotypical references to Chinese people. In December 2008 Sadowitz sold out the Queen Elizabeth Hall on the Southbank, London.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/jerry-sadowitz--talking-through-his-hat-562890.html title=Jerry Sadowitz : Talking through his hat last=Hall first=Julian date=11 May 2004 location=London work=The Independent}}</ref>

Since 2010, Sadowitz has performed several runs at the Leicester Square Theatre in London.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.leicestersquaretheatre.com/lqt/show/S1259244921/Jerry+Sadowitz title=Jerry Sadowitz is Back publisher=The Leicester Square Theatre deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216024140/http://www.leicestersquaretheatre.com/lqt/show/S1259244921/Jerry+Sadowitz archivedate=16 December 2010 df=dmy-all}}</ref> In April 2011, Sadowitz recorded two of these performances with the intention of releasing a DVD.<ref>{{cite web url=http://thebrokenbones.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/jerry-sadowitz-is-filming-a-dvd/ title=Jerry Sadowitz is filming a DVD publisher=Broken Bones}}</ref> The release was shelved after he changed his mind about releasing anything, stating that "I don’t want people looking at me on a DVD for the first time – and there are loads of people who haven’t seen me – and thinking: "Oh, he’s a bit like Frankie Boyle. Oh, he’s a bit like Ricky Gervais, he’s a bit like Jimmy Carr or Chubby Brown. I’ve heard Doug Stanhope do that..." So I don’t want people saying that about me."<ref name="timeout1"/>
In 2012, after Sadowitzs first UK wide tour in many years he is quoted as saying he didnt make a penny from the tour{{Citation needed date=August 2016}}.
Sadowitz appeared in the 2012 Kathy Burke comedy-drama Walking and Talking on Sky Atlantic, playing the character Jimmy the Jew.

In 2016, Sadowitz launched the "Trick of the Month Club" in which he teaches a new card trick every month to paying subscribers. In late 2016 Sadowitz tour "Comedian, Magician, Psychopath!" visited London, Glasgow, Manchester and Wolverhampton.

In October 2015, Sadowitz set up Farbissener Limited to promote and present his stage act.<ref>http://www.checkdirector.co.uk/director/jerry-sadowitz/</ref> Fabissenner is Yiddish for embittered.<ref>http://www.translate-yiddish.com/en/dictionary-english-yiddish/Embittered</ref>

In 2012 Sadowitz created "Magic Challenge", a live magic panel show most notably performed at the Soho Theatre. At select times throughout the year Sadowitz teaches beginners magic courses at the Leicester Square Theatre.

In early 2017 Sadowitz performed a brief run of shows at the Soho Theatre entitled "Card Tricks with Inappropriate Patter" and in summer 2017 embarked on his new show "Comedian, Magician, Psychopath!".

==Comedy style==
The Derek and Clive sketches by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore were an early influence on Sadowitz. Much of his comedy emulates in its provocativeness and sheer offensiveness (he once described the Derek & Clive dialogues as "comic poetry"){{citation needed date=November 2014}}.

Sadowitz often comments in a seemingly callous way on contemporary disasters and tragedies which have struck groups or individuals. He uses obscene language liberally and to cutting comedic effect. His comedy style combines the visual traditions of the magician, often using gaudy conjuring props, with political social and cultural observations which deliberately challenge the norms, taboos and transient sensitivities of contemporary culture. He has often been considered as one of the worlds most offensive comedians. His controversial style of humour has also influenced a generation of comedians, or "imitators" as he refers to them. Comedians who now use his style of humour include Frankie Boyle, Jim Jefferies (comedian) Jim Jefferies, Jimmy Carr and Ricky Gervais.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.ents24.com/web/artist/19862/Jerry_Sadowitz.html   location=London   title=Jerry Sadowitz Tour Dates   date=5 January 2012}}</ref> Speaking on his "imitators", he said that "Im sorry Ive given some very nasty people a good living."<ref>{{cite news last=Kettle first=James title=Jerry Sadowitz: his dark materials url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/09/jerry-sadowitz-interview accessdate=5 August 2012 newspaper=The Guardian date=9 November 2011 location=London}}</ref>

He reacted against the alternative comedy movement by dealing in an aggressive and uncompromising way with issues of race and gender which challenged the prevailing orthodoxy of the alternative comedy scene. Outbursts of his savage comedy during his conjuring shows have sometimes alienated him from the more conservative magic community.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.geniimagazine.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=122267 first=Richard  last=Kaufman work=Genii Magazine date=17 February 2008 title=The Crimp, Jerry Sadowitz}}</ref>
