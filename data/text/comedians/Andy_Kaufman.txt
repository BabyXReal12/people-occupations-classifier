==Early life==

==Career==
===Foreign Man and Mighty Mouse===
Kaufman first received major attention for his character Foreign Man, who spoke in a meek, high-pitched, heavy-accented voice and claimed to be from "Caspiar", a fictional island in the Caspian Sea.<ref name="cabaret"/> It was as this character that Kaufman convinced the owner of the famed New York City comedy club The Improv, Budd Friedman, to allow him to perform on stage.<ref>{{cite web title=Improv Comedy Club History url=http://improv.com/History}}</ref><ref name="zoglin">{{cite book date=2008 last=Zoglin first=Richard title=Comedy at the Edge: How Stand-up in the 1970s Changed America url=http://www.abebooks.com/9781582346243/Comedy-Edge-Stand-up-1970s-Changed-1582346240/plp isbn=1582346240 publisher=Bloomsbury USA accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref>

As Foreign Man, Kaufman would appear on the stage of comedy clubs, play a recording of the theme from the Mighty Mouse cartoon show while standing perfectly still, and lip sync lip-sync only the line "Here I come to save the day" with great enthusiasm.<ref name="cnn2012"/> He would proceed to tell a few (purposely poor) jokes and conclude his act with a series of celebrity impersonator impersonations, with the comedy arising from the characters obvious ineptitude at impersonation. For example, in his fake accent Kaufman would say to the audience, "I would like to imitate Jimmy Carter Meester Carter, de president of de United States" and then, in exactly the same voice, say "Hello, I am Meester Carter, de president of de United States. Tank you veddy much."
At some point in the performance, usually when the audience was conditioned to Foreign Mans inability to perform a single convincing impression, Foreign Man would announce, "And now I would like to imitate the Elvis Presley", turn around, take off his jacket, slick his hair back, and launch into a rousing, hip-shaking, excellent rendition of Presley singing one of his hit songs. Like Presley, he would take off his leather jacket during the song and throw it into the audience, but unlike Presley, Foreign Man would immediately ask for it to be returned. After the songs finale, he would take a simple bow and say in his Foreign Man voice, "Tank you veddy much."{{citation needed date=January 2017}}

Portions of Kaufmans Foreign Man act were broadcast in the first season of Saturday Night Live. The Mighty Mouse number was featured in the October 11, 1975, premiere, while the joke-telling and celebrity impressions (including Elvis) were included in the November 8 broadcast that same year.<ref name="snl-s1">SNL: The Complete First Season, 1975–1976.

===Latka===
{{Main Latka Gravas}}
File:Akaufman1.jpg thumb 210px right Kaufmans well-known Foreign Man persona was later adapted as the character Latka Gravas on ABC sitcom Taxi. Though Kaufmans performances on Taxi were widely praised, even receiving two Golden Globe nominations, he was unhappy about being so closely identified with Latka.

Kaufman first used his Foreign Man character in nightclubs in the early 1970s, often to tell jokes incorrectly and do weak imitations of famous people before bursting into his Elvis Presley imitation. The character was then changed into Latka Gravas for American Broadcasting Company ABCs sitcom Taxi (TV series) Taxi, appearing in 79 of 114 episodes in 1978-83.{{citation needed date=January 2017}} Bob Zmuda confirms this: "They basically were buying Andys Foreign Man character for the Taxi character Latka."<ref name="oral">[http://www.bluedonut.com/ak.htm "Andy Kaufman Oral History"] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206215413/http://www.bluedonut.com/ak.htm  date=December 6, 2006 }}, interviews with Don Steinberg, originally published in short form in GQ Magazine, December 1999.</ref> Kaufmans longtime manager George Shapiro encouraged him to take the gig.

Kaufman disliked sitcoms and was not happy with the idea of being in one, but Shapiro convinced him that it would quickly lead to stardom, which would earn him money he could then put into his own act. Kaufman agreed to appear in 14 episodes per season, and initially wanted four for Kaufmans alter ego Tony Clifton. After Kaufman deliberately sabotaged Cliftons appearance on the show, however, that part of his contract was dropped.<ref name="clifton">{{cite web date=May 23, 1984 last=Shales first=Tom title=Kaufmans many faces made him one of a kind url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19840523&id=gWoaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QioEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7154,1748529&hl=en publisher=The Milwaukee Journal accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref>

His character was given multiple personality disorder, which allowed Kaufman to randomly portray other characters. In one episode of Taxi, Kaufmans character came down with a condition that made him act like Alex Reiger, the main character played by Judd Hirsch. Another such recurring character played by Kaufman was the womanizing Vic Ferrari.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0718495 Taxi (Season 3, Episode 20, "Latka the Playboy"], imdb.com; accessed January 28, 2017.</ref>

Sam Simon, who early in his career was a writer and later showrunner for Taxi, stated in a 2013 interview on Marc Marons WTF with Marc Maron WTF podcast that the story of Kaufman having been generally disruptive on the show was "a complete fiction" largely created by Zmuda. Simon maintained that Zmuda has a vested interest in promoting an out-of-control image of Kaufman. In the interview Simon stated that Kaufman was "completely professional" and that he "told you Tony Clifton was him", but he also conceded that Kaufman would have "loved" Zmudas version of events.<ref>Maron, Marc (May 16, 2013).

Kaufman was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor&nbsp;– Series, Miniseries or Television Film Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Limited Series, or Motion Picture Made For Television for Taxi in 1979 and 1981.<ref>{{cite web title=Golden Globe Awards: Winners & Nominees url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/person/andy-kaufman publisher=GoldenGlobes.com accessdate=October 7, 2016}}</ref>

===Tony Clifton===
{{refimprove section date=January 2017}}
{{Main Tony Clifton}}
Another well-known Kaufman character is Tony Clifton, an absurd, audience-abusing lounge singer who began opening for Kaufman at comedy clubs and eventually even performed concerts on his own around the country. Sometimes it was Kaufman performing as Clifton, sometimes it was his brother Michael or Zmuda. For a brief time, it was unclear to some that Clifton was not a real person. News programs interviewed Clifton as Kaufmans opening act, with the mood turning ugly whenever Kaufmans name came up. Kaufman, Clifton insisted, was attempting to ruin Cliftons "good name" in order to make money and become famous.

As a requirement for Kaufmans accepting the offer to star on Taxi, he insisted that Clifton be hired for a guest role on the show as if he were a real person, not a character.<ref name="clifton"/> After throwing a tantrum on the set, Clifton was fired and escorted from the studio lot by security guards. Much to Kaufmans delight, this incident was reported in the local newspapers.<ref name="standup">{{cite book date=2009 last=Knoedelseder first=William title=Im Dying Up Here: Heartbreak and High Times in Stand-up Comedys Golden Era isbn=9781586483173 publisher=PublicAffairs}}</ref>

===Carnegie Hall show===
At the beginning of an April 1979 performance at New Yorks Carnegie Hall, Kaufman invited his "grandmother" to watch the show from a chair he had placed at the side of the stage. At the end of the show, she stood up, took her mask off and revealed to the audience that she was actually comedian Robin Williams in disguise.<ref>{{cite news date=April 28, 1979 last=Maslin first=Janet title=Comedy: Andy Kaufman Fills Stage With Parade of Odd Characters url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/28/archives/comedy-andy-kaufman-fills-stage-with-parade-of-odd-characters.html website=The New York Times accessdate=July 30, 2016}}</ref>

Kaufman also had an elderly woman (Eleanor Cody Gould) pretend to have a heart attack and die on stage, at which point he reappeared on stage wearing a Native American headdress and performed a dance over her body, "reviving" her.<ref>{{cite book last=Shackett first=Barbara date=2013 title=Stranded in Montana; Dumped in Arizona url=https://books.google.com/?id=jnL3GnL3HfQC&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=eleanor+cody+gould+andy+kaufman#v=onepage&q=eleanor%20cody%20gould%20andy%20kaufman&f=false publisher=Dorrance Publishing isbn=9781434928559 accessdate=July 30, 2016}}</ref><ref name="washingtonpost1979">{{cite web date=July 1, 1979 last=Carter first=Betsy title=Hide-n-seek in Andy Kaufmans fun house url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/hide-n-seek-in-andy-kaufmans-fun-house/2014/10/06/e2e03928-4d93-11e4-8c24-487e92bc997b_story.html website=The Washington Post accessdate=July 8, 2016}}</ref>

The performance is most famous for Kaufmans ending the show by actually taking the entire audience, in 24 buses, out for milk and cookies.

===TV specials===
The Taxi deal with American Broadcasting Company ABC included giving Kaufman a television special/pilot. He came up with Andys Funhouse, based on an old routine he had developed while in junior college. The special was taped in 1977 but did not air until August 1979. It featured most of Andys famous gags, including Foreign Man/Latka and his Elvis Presley impersonation, as well as a host of unique segments (including a special appearance by childrens television character Howdy Doody and the "Has-been Corner").<ref>{{cite news date=August 28, 1979 last=Maslin first=Janet title=TV: A 90‐Minute Special With Andy Kaufman url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/28/archives/tv-a-90minute-special-with-andy-kaufman.html website=The New York Times accessdate=July 30, 2016}}</ref> There was also a segment that included fake television screen static as part of the gag, which ABC executives were not comfortable with, fearing that viewers would mistake the static for broadcast problems and would change the channel—which was the comic element Kaufman wanted to present.<ref>{{cite web date=August 3, 1989 last=Wickstrom first=Andy title=Andy Kaufman Still Surprises in a 1977 Video url=http://articles.philly.com/1989-08-03/entertainment/26147012_1_latka-gravas-andy-kaufman-foreigner website=The Philadelphia Inquirer accessdate=July 12, 2016}}</ref> Andys Funhouse was written by Kaufman, Zmuda, and Mel Sherer, with music by Kaufman.<ref>{{cite web date=July 22, 2013 last=Elisberg first=Robert J. title=Pal Mel url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-j-elisberg/pal-mel_b_3319754.html website=The Huffington Post accessdate=July 12, 2016}}</ref>

In March 1980, Kaufman filmed a short segment for an ABC show called Buckshot. The segment was just over six minutes long and was called Uncle Andys Funhouse. It featured Kaufman as the host of a childrens show for adults, complete with a peanut gallery and Tony Clifton puppet.<ref name="uncleandy">{{cite web date=July 18, 1980 last=Arnott first=Susan L. title=The Television Picture: Whats Special... url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19800718&id=JiEqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rysEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6782,4112414&hl=en publisher=The Milwaukee Journal accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref>

In 1983, a show very similar to Andys Funhouse and Uncle Andys Funhouse was filmed for Public Broadcasting Service PBSs Soundstage (TV series) SoundStage program, called The Andy Kaufman Show. It too featured a peanut gallery, and cold open opened in the middle of an interview Kaufman is doing in which he is laughing hysterically. He then proceeds to thank the audience for watching and the credits roll.{{citation needed date=January 2017}}

===Fridays incidents===
In 1981 Kaufman made three appearances on Fridays (ABC TV series) Fridays, a variety show on ABC that was similar to Saturday Night Live. In his first appearance, during a sketch about four people out on a dinner date who excuse themselves to the restroom to smoke cannabis (drug) marijuana, Kaufman broke character and refused to say his lines.<ref>{{cite news date=February 24, 1981 last=Schwartz first=Tony title=Was Fight on TV Real or Staged?

In response, cast member Michael Richards walked off camera and returned with a set of cue cards and dumped them on the table in front of Kaufman who responded by splashing Richards with water. Co-producer Jack Burns stormed onto the stage, leading to a brawl on camera before the show abruptly cut away to a commercial.<ref>{{cite video url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/544255131b title=Andy Kaufman on Fridays from FridaysFan publisher=Funnyordie.com date=February 11, 2008 accessdate=February 10, 2010}}</ref>

Richards has claimed that this incident was a staged practical joke that was known only to him, associate producer Burns, and Kaufman,<ref>[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2 "Michael Richards Speaking Freely transcript"]; recorded February 28, 2002 in Aspen, Colorado.

Kaufman appeared the following week in a videotaped apology to the home viewers. Later that year, Kaufman returned to host Fridays. At one point in the show, he invited a Lawrence Welk Show gospel and standards singer, Kathie Sullivan, on stage to sing a few gospel songs with him and announced that the two were engaged to be married, then talked to the audience about his newfound faith in Jesus (Kaufman was Jewish). That was also a hoax.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60822022.html title=Kaufman Was My Hoax Fiance; The Taxi star pulled some of the funniest stunts on US TV, but his fake engagement fooled the world last=Burton first=Alex date=February 25, 2000 work=Daily Record (Scotland) Daily Record accessdate= January 1, 2014}}</ref> Later, following a sketch about a drug-abusing pharmacist, Kaufman was supposed to introduce the band The Pretenders.

After his speech, he informed the audience that he had talked for too long and had to go to a commercial.{{citation needed date=January 2017}}

===Professional wrestling===
Inspired by the theatricality of kayfabe, the staged nature of the sport, and his own tendency to form elaborate hoaxes, Kaufman began Intergender wrestling wrestling women during his act and proclaimed himself "Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion of the World", taking on an aggressive and ridiculous personality based on the characters invented by professional wrestlers.

When he returned to Los Angeles, he consulted another physician, then checked himself into Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for a series of medical tests. A few days later, he was diagnosed with Large-cell lung carcinoma large-cell carcinoma, an extremely rare type of lung cancer.
