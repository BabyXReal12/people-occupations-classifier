on building sites.

==15 Minutes of Misery and 15 Storeys High==
Lock made regular appearances on various radio panel shows, script-edited for Bill Baileys 1998 BBC2 series, Is It Bill Bailey? and had his own show on BBC Radio 4, 15 Minutes of Misery.

As the title suggested, these shows filled a 15-minute time-slot and also featured Kevin Eldon and Hattie Hayridge. The premise involved Lock eavesdropping on his neighbours in his south London tower block (all played by Lock, Eldon and Hayridge) using a bugging device fitted by his plumber, "Hot Bob" (Eldon), which was known as "The Bugger King" (and had "nothing to do with meat or sex").

15 Minutes of Misery lasted for one series of six programmes in late 1998 and early 1999, and would later be expanded into the half-hour series 15 Storeys High. From ostensibly the same tower block, Locks character was now given a flatmate (the hapless Errol) and a job at the local swimming baths, as well as a somewhat dour and intolerant demeanour.

The bugging device was no longer used, but the antics of Locks neighbours still featured heavily in the show. The plots for this series were more linear in a "traditional" sitcom style, although they still showed Locks brand of dark, surreal humour.

15 Storeys High would transfer to television after two radio series, with Locks character renamed Vince, for a further two series in 2002 and 2004.

==Other work==

In 1995, Lock played an escaped murderer in an episode of The World of Lee Evans, alongside Lee Evans (comedian) Lee Evans and Phil Daniels.

Lock wrote the screenplay for Andrew Köttings 2001 feature film This Filthy Earth, based on the novel La Terre by Émile Zola.

In 2004, Lock had a guest appearance in televisions first ever "dope opera", Top Buzzer, written by Johnny Vaughan. In 2005 he became a regular team captain on the panel game 8 Out of 10 Cats.

In spring 2006, he hosted his own entertainment show on Channel 4 called TV Heaven, Telly Hell. Lock narrated  the BBC production World Cup Goals Galore in 2006. In 2008 he appeared on The Big Fat Quiz of the Year, on a team with James Corden. Lock has also appeared on many popular British TV panel shows including Have I Got News for You, QI and They Think Its All Over (TV series) They Think Its All Over. He was also a celebrity guest in The Last Leg. Lock became "The Curator" for the second radio series of The Museum of Curiosity, in 2009, taking over from Bill Bailey. During an interview on This Morning (TV programme) This Morning in 2013, Lock announced he would now only appear on 8 Out of 10 Cats, as he felt he had become typecast for appearing on panel shows, joking that people had started approaching him in the street asking "Are you Dave (TV channel) Dave?"

In 2010, Lock took part in Channel 4s Comedy Gala, a Benefit concert benefit show held in aid of Great Ormond Street Hospital Great Ormond Street Childrens Hospital, filmed live at the The O2 Arena (London) O2 Arena.
