==Saturday Night Live==
In the summer of 1980, Piscopo was hired as a contract player for Saturday Night Live. The show had gone through major upheaval when all the writers, major producers, and cast members left that spring. The all-new cast bombed with critics and fans, with the exception of Piscopo and Eddie Murphy; thus they were the only two cast members to be kept when Dick Ebersol took over the show the following spring. With the success of SNL, Piscopo moved to the wealthy borough of Alpine, New Jersey.<ref name=SoJersey/>

Piscopo was best known for his impressions of celebrities such as Frank Sinatra, although he allegedly feared for his life due to Personal life of Frank Sinatra#Alleged organized-crime links Sinatras alleged Mafia ties. Piscopo rewrote the lyrics for a Sinatra sketch with the help of Sinatra lyricist Sammy Cahn, and recalled that "by the grace of God, the old man loved it."<ref name="snlbackstage20110220">{{cite episode   title=Saturday Night Live Backstage   network=NBC   airdate=2011-02-20}}</ref>
