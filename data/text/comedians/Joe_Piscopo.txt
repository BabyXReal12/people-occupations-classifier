Joseph Charles John Piscopo (pronounced PIS-co-po; born June 17, 1951) is an American comedian, actor, musician, writer, and a nationally syndicated radio talk show host. He is best known for his work on Saturday Night Live in the early 1980s where he played a variety of recurring characters.

==Early life==
Born in Passaic, New Jersey, Piscopo grew up in North Caldwell, New Jersey North Caldwell
and attended West Essex High School and was a member of the drama club "the Masquers".
He developed a reputation for never playing a part the way it was written. After graduating from high school in 1969, Piscopo attended Jones College (Jacksonville) Jones College in Jacksonville, Florida, where he received a degree in broadcast management.
==Saturday Night Live==
In the summer of 1980, Piscopo was hired as a contract player for Saturday Night Live. The show had gone through major upheaval when all the writers, major producers, and cast members left that spring. The all-new cast bombed with critics and fans, with the exception of Piscopo and Eddie Murphy; thus they were the only two cast members to be kept when Dick Ebersol took over the show the following spring. With the success of SNL, Piscopo moved to the wealthy borough of Alpine, New Jersey.
