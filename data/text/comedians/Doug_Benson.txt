On August 4, 2009, Bensons second album, Unbalanced Load, was released by Comedy Central Records. His third album, Hypocritical Oaf was released on August 31, 2010.

===Doug Loves Movies podcast===
In 2006, Benson began hosting a weekly comedy podcast, titled Doug Loves Movies (formerly I Love Movies with Doug Benson), which is recorded in front of a live audience at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Los Angeles. The show typically tapes weekly, and is later archived on iTunes for fans to listen to for free. Benson and guests talk about movies and comedy both. Bensons guests have included such notables as Daniel Van Kirk as Mark Wahlberg, John Lithgow, Leonard Maltin, Brian Posehn, Joe Rogan, Zach Galifianakis, Sarah Silverman, Patton Oswalt, Jon Hamm, Adam Carolla, David Cross, Bob Odenkirk, Scott Aukerman, Adam Scott (actor) Adam Scott, Ron Bennington, Aziz Ansari, Amy Poehler, Wayne Federman, Elisabeth Shue, Aubrey Plaza, Michael Cera, Edgar Wright, Paul F. Tompkins, T.J. Miller, Kumail Nanjiani, Gillian Jacobs, Michael Sheen.

A regular feature of the podcast is the Leonard Maltin Game, which has been described as Name That Tune with movies instead of songs.<ref name="cm">Culture Mob article: "[http://culturemob.com/blog/doug-benson-at-the-arlington-cinema-drafthouse Doug Benson at the Arlington Cinema Drafthouse]."</ref> The game consists of Benson reading excerpts from a Leonard Maltin review and guests wagering how many names, read from the bottom of the cast list up, it would take for them to identify the movie.

Other regular features of the podcast include the segments Tweet Relief: Tweets About Movies, Watch This/Not That, Not for Emetophobes, and From the Corrections Department, as well as the games Build a Title, Name a Movie, A-B-C-Deez Nuts, How Much Did This Shit Make?, Lincoln or Bane?, Love, Like, Hate, Hate-Like, Doing Lines with Mark Wahlberg, Last Man Stanton, Whose Tagline Is It Anyway, Now Buscemi Now You Dont, Tell The Truth!, Live Die Repeat, Alex and Jason and Debs IMDB game, and F Marry Kill: Movies.

At the conclusion of many of the early podcasts, Doug would state "As always, Willem Dafoe is a Shithead," which resulted in so many people wondering about why, that Google searches began to automatically complete the phrase as a suggested match. The Willem Dafoe comment started as a joke based on the fact that it would seemingly be the only bad words ever uttered about Dafoe, but many people didnt catch on and, after explaining it a few times, Benson decided to let Dafoe rest. Now, the runners up in the Leonard Maltin game are allowed to name one shithead as a consolation prize.

In 2010, Benson started an annual, 2 hour Twelve Guests of Christmas special every holiday season. This episode features 12 guests (occasionally more) rather than the usual 3 guests and they play an elimination style Leonard Maltin Game. Scott Aukerman won the first year, while Graham Elwood dominated the next two years in a row.<ref>{{cite web url=http://astrecords.com/dlm/index.php#season5  title=Doug Loves Movies  publisher=Astrecords.com  date=  accessdate=2014-02-12}}</ref> The 2013 champion was podcast fan and Pardcast-A-Thon auction winner, Sean Sakimae. Sakimae also qualified for the next Tournament of Champions for naming the film Titanic (1997 film) Titanic in negative names and winning the game.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DougLovesMovies/~3/vyqrarAccDo/jon-hamm-rich-sommer-josh-malina-and-10-more-compete  title=Doug Loves Movies : Jon Hamm, Rich Sommer, Josh Malina and 10 more compete  publisher=Feedproxy.google.com  date=2013-12-18  accessdate=2014-02-12 }}{{dead link date=September 2017  bot=InternetArchiveBot  fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Riki Lindhome beat Jimmy Pardo in the finals of the 2014 edition when Pardo couldnt get the name Lori Singer when going negative three on Footloose (1984 film) Footloose. Scott Aukerman bested Sarah Silverman for his second win in 2015.

==Film and television==

===Super High Me===
In 2008, Benson was the protagonist of the film Super High Me (a play on the name and concept of the film Super Size Me), released on DVD on June 10, 2008.

The results of the experiment were that it had little or no negative effects on Dougs health. Doug is currently suing the people who made the original film to stop a sequel.<ref name="sfweekly">{{cite web url=http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/news-marijuana-cannabis-legalization-netflix-doug-benson-super-high-me-film/Content?oid=4420121 author=Chris Roberts title=Why is Doug Benson Blocking a Super High Me Sequel? &#124; Chem Tales &#124; San Francisco &#124; San Francisco News and Events website=SF Weekly accessdate=2018-03-26}}</ref>
