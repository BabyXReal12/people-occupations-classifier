Rogen later got a part on sitcom Undeclared, which also hired him as a writer.

After landing his job as a staff writer on the final season of Da Ali G Show, Apatow guided him toward a film career. Rogen made his first movie appearance in Donnie Darko with a minor role in 2001. Rogen was cast in a supporting role and credited as a co-producer in Apatows directorial debut, The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Universal Pictures subsequently cast him as the lead in Apatows films Knocked Up and Funny People. Rogen co-starred as Steve Wozniak in Universals Steve Jobs (film) Steve Jobs biopic in 2015.

==Early life==
Rogen was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to a Jewish family. His mother, Sandy (née Belogus), is a social worker, and his father, Mark Rogen, worked for Non-governmental organization non-profit organizations and as an assistant director of the Workmens Circle Jewish fraternal organization.
Since Rogens father is American, he has American citizenship by birth, though the actor has stated "I definitely associate with being Canadian much more than being American" because he grew up in Canada.
He has described his parents, who met on kibbutz Beit Alfa in Israel, as "radical Jewish socialists."
Rogen has an older sister named Danya,
and attended Vancouver Talmud Torah Elementary School and Point Grey Secondary School, incorporating many of his classmates into his writing. He was also known for the stand-up comedy he performed at Camp Miriam, a Habonim Dror camp.
Rogen was raised Jewish.
As a child, Rogen did not want to pursue any career other than comedy, stating "As soon as I realized you could be funny as a job, that was the job I wanted".
He got his start in show business at age 12 after enrolling in a comedy workshop taught by Mark Pooley.
His early comedy routines involved jokes about his bar mitzvah, his grandparents, and his camp counsellors.
During his teenage years, he would perform stand-up comedy routines at places like bar mitzvahs and small parties, later shifting to bars.
A mohel paid him to write jokes.
At the age of 13, he co-wrote a rough draft of Superbad (film) Superbad with childhood friend Evan Goldberg, whom he had met at Bar and Bat Mitzvah bar mitzvah classes.
Based on their teenage experiences,
Rogen and Goldberg spent the rest of their time in high school polishing the script. They initially worried that American Pie (film) American Pie (1999) had beaten them to the idea for the movie, but they decided that the film "managed to totally avoid all honest interaction between characters... which is what were going for."
His mother was supportive of his comic endeavours and would often drive him to stand-up gigs at the comedy club Yuk Yuks.
With his deadpan humour, he placed second in the Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest at 16 years old.
Also when Rogen was 16, his father lost his job and his mother quit hers, forcing them to put their house up for sale and relocate to a significantly smaller apartment. Around this time, he landed a role on Judd Apatows television show Freaks and Geeks after attending a local casting call.
Despite a strong academic performance, Rogen dropped out of high school, began working for Apatow,
and relocated with his family to Los Angeles. Rogen paid the bills and had become the main wage earner at just 16.
==Career==

===1999–2006: Early work and friendship with Judd Apatow===
Rogens acting debut was in Apatows Freaks and Geeks, a cult hit series first released in 1999 as List of Freaks and Geeks characters#Ken Miller Ken Miller, a cynical, acerbic "freak".
Revolving around a group of teenagers lives, Freaks and Geeks first aired in 1999. Although well-reviewed, the show was NBCs lowest-viewed program and was cancelled after one season due to poor ratings.
Impressed with Rogens improvisational skills,
Apatow then chose him as the lead in another of his shows, Undeclared. Rogen was originally set to play a fairly popular but nerdy college freshman, but the network did not think he was leading male material. Apatow opted not to go along with the show.
Rogen also served as a staff writer to the short-lived production.
Following the shows cancellation in 2002, Rogen did not get many auditions, which was not upsetting to him as he always thought he would achieve better success as a writer.
He would soon be a part of Apatows "frat pack", a close-knit group that includes Steve Carell and Paul Rudd.
Of the awkwardness of a grown man spending so much time with a teenaged Rogen, Apatow said: "Im such a comedy fan that, even though hes 16, I know Im hanging out with one of the guys whos going to be one of the great comics."
Around this time, Apatow would come up with odd requests for Rogen and Goldberg, such as turn an idea of his into a movie in 10 days and come up with 100 one-page ideas for films.
Regarding Apatows professional effect on Rogen, the actor said in 2009, "Obviously, I cant stress how important Judds been to my career".
Rogen had roles in Donnie Darko (2001) and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004).
A big career point for him was becoming a staff writer for Sacha Baron Cohens last season of Da Ali G Show in 2004.
Along with the shows other writers, Rogen received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.
He became familiar to audiences as one of the main characters co-workers in Apatows well-reviewed buddy comedy directorial debut feature The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005).
Rogen also co-produced it and improvised all his dialogue.
"[Rogen] hadnt done any screen work that indicated he could carry as memorable and convincing a performance as he does with the character Cal," MTVs John Constantine wrote.
The Boston Globe reviewer Wesley Morris wrote that Rogen, along with co-stars Rudd and Romany Malco, were each hilarious in their own right
and Orlando Sentinel{{s}} Roger Moore believed that Rogen had his moments in the film
whereas Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times said the actor was "droopily deadpan."
He followed this with a small role in You, Me and Dupree (2006), a critically panned comedy featuring Matt Dillon, Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson.
===2007–2009: Breakthrough as a leading man===
File:SethRogen 7 2007.JPG thumb 185px upright Rogen in 2007
His breakthrough came when Universal Studios greenlit him for the lead in yet another Apatow production: Knocked Up (2007), a romantic comedy that follows the repercussions of a drunken one-night stand between his slacker character and Katherine Heigls just-promoted media personality that results in an unintended pregnancy. Upon completing The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Apatow had approached Rogen about potential starring roles, but the actor suggested many high-concept science fiction ideas. After Apatow insisted that he would work better in real life situations, the two agreed on the accidental pregnancy concept of this production.
Rogen called shooting sex scenes with Heigl "nerve-racking" and found comfort with the supporting cast since, even though he played a lead, the focus was not all on him.
Made on a $30 million budget and released on June 1, Knocked Up was a critical and commercial box office hit, garnering an approval rating of 90 percent on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes and grossing $219 million.
Rogen also received favourable reviews.
Later that year he played a supporting part as an irresponsible police officer in Superbad (film) Superbad, which he had written with his writing partner and was co-produced by Apatow. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill originate the main roles, two teenage best friends whose party plans go wrong, based on them.
The film and their writing was praised, with critics finding it to be very authentic.
It topped the US box office for two weeks in a row.
He made a vocal cameo appearance in the animated film Shrek the Third, also released in 2007.
Rogen hosted Saturday Night Live on October 6, 2007.
Rogens projects in 2008 included Jimmy Haywards Horton Hears a Who! (film) Horton Hears a Who!, an animated film based on the Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a Who! book, that Rogen voiced a character in,
and the fantasy film The Spiderwick Chronicles (film) The Spiderwick Chronicles, in which he voiced a hobgoblin.
Rogen additionally co-wrote Drillbit Taylor, also produced by Apatow and starring Owen Wilson as the homeless titular character.
He based the screenplay on a 70-page scriptment done by John Hughes (filmmaker) John Hughes.
The movie was panned by critics who thought its plot – a grown man becoming three kids bodyguard and beating up their bullies – had no focus and was drawn out. "If Superbad were remade as a gimmicky Nickelodeon (TV channel) Nickelodeon movie, it would probably look something like Drillbit Taylor" Josh Bell wrote in the Las Vegas Weekly.
He again lent his voice to another animated movie, this time Kung Fu Panda, with Jack Black and Angelina Jolie.
It did exceptionally well in theatres, making more than $630 million.
Rogen made a cameo appearance in the comedy Step Brothers (film) Step Brothers, released in July.
Rogen, Goldberg and Apatow were behind the stoner movie stoner action comedy Pineapple Express (film) Pineapple Express directed by David Gordon Green at Columbia Pictures. Apatow produced it while Rogen and Goldberg wrote the script.
Rogen was chosen to play the films protagonist, a 25-year-old who accidentally witnesses a murder while delivering a subpoena. James Franco was cast as his hippie pot dealer that he goes on the run with. When asked about its inspiration, Rogen said he wrote what he knew.
Pineapple Express was released to theatres on August 6 and made $101 million in ticket sales against its $27 million production budget.
Movie critics lauded it, appreciating their performances and its humor.
In April 2008, Empire (magazine) Empire reported Rogen and Goldberg would write an episode for the animated television series The Simpsons.
He also voiced a character in the episode,
entitled "Homer the Whopper", which opened the The Simpsons (season 21) twenty-first season.
Kevin Smiths romantic comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno rounded out 2008 for the actor. He and Elizabeth Banks portrayed the title roles: Pennsylvania roommates who try to make some extra cash by making an porn movie adult film together. After having difficulty trying to secure an Motion Picture Association of America film rating system R rating, Rogen commented to MTV, "Its a really filthy movie," but complained, "Its really crazy to me that Hostel (2005 film) Hostel is fine, with people gouging their eyes out and shit like that... But you cant show two people having sex – thats too much".
The picture was distributed on Halloween by The Weinstein Company and disappointed at the box office.
Along with Reese Witherspoon, he voiced a character in the animated science fiction Monsters vs Aliens (2009), which did well commercially, with a total of $381.5 million.
He then starred in the Jody Hill-directed mall cop comedy Observe and Report,
in which he portrayed Bipolar disorder bipolar mall security guard Ronnie Barnhart. The film opened in theatres on April 10. Critics noted a departure in Rogens acting style from playing laid-back roles to playing a more sadistic character; Wesley Morris from The Boston Globe opined that "Often with Rogen, his vulnerability makes his coarseness safe... Ronnie is something altogether new for Rogen. Vulnerability never arrives. Hes shameless."
Later in 2009, Rogen starred in Apatows third directorial feature, Funny People, with Adam Sandler. Rogen played a young, inexperienced comic while Sandler played a mentor of sorts to his character; the film had more dramatic elements in it than Apatows previous efforts.
Funny People was a commercial failure, coming short of its $75 million budget, despite positive reviews.
Rogen hosted Saturday Night Live again on April 4, 2009, where the music video for the Lonely Island song "Like a Boss", in which he starred, premiered.
===2010–present: Continued success, directing, and television work===

After years of development, a feature film adaptation of The Green Hornet (2011 film) The Green Hornet was handled by Rogen and Goldberg, with a theatrical release in January 2011. Rogen chose to do a re-imagining of the The Green Hornet title character.
He was executive producer of the movie and also cast himself as the main character. Rogen later admitted to having been overwhelmed by handling its $120 million budget. "Its insane. But its not so much the specific amount of money thats stressful, its all the things that go along with making a movie of that size."
The actor also went on a strict weight-loss diet to play the slim crime fighter.
The Green Hornet was a critical disappointment; Adam Graham of the Detroit News called it "a big, sloppy, loud, grating mess of a movie"
and the Arizona Republic{{}}s Bill Goodykoontz found its story to have fallen apart.
Nonetheless it still opened at number one at the box office, making $33 million in its opening weekend before going on to gross more than $225 million.
In 2011, Rogen and Evan Goldberg founded the production company Point Grey Pictures, named after Point Grey Secondary School, which they both attended.

drawing mixed opinions from film critics. Scott Foundas of Variety (magazine) Variety found the film to be  "about as funny as a communist food shortage, and just as protracted",
