Macdonalds first performances in comedy were at stand-up comedy stand-up clubs in Ottawa. He appeared at the 1987 Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal.<ref>{{cite web title=Norm Macdonald Biography first=Todd  last=Jackson  url=http://www.dead-frog.com/comedians/comic/norm_macdonald/ publisher=Dead-Frog  accessdate=March 24, 2011}}{{Dubious date=May 2011}}<!-- please locate a more reliable source than this --></ref>

===Saturday Night Live===
Macdonald joined the cast of NBCs Saturday Night Live (SNL) television program in 1993, where he performed impressions of Larry King, Burt Reynolds, David Letterman, Quentin Tarantino, Charles Kuralt and Bob Dole, among others. Following Kevin Nealons departure from SNL, Macdonald anchored the segment "Weekend Update". Current "Weekend Update" anchor and writer Colin Jost named Macdonald as a primary influence on Josts own work behind the "Update" desk, explaining that Macdonalds tone was one that Jost grew up with in high school.<ref name=Fretts>Fretts, Bruce (April 7, 2014). "Surely You Jost!". TV Guide. p. 9.</ref>

Macdonalds version of "Weekend Update" often included references to prison rape, crack whores, and the Germans love of Baywatch star David Hasselhoff. Macdonald would occasionally deliver a piece of news, then take out his personal compact tape recorder and leave a "note to self" relevant to what he just discussed. He commonly used Frank Stallone as a Non sequitur (absurdism) non sequitur Punch line punchline. Macdonald repeatedly ridiculed public figures such as Marion Barry, Hillary Clinton, Michael Jackson and O. J. Simpson. Throughout O. J. Simpson murder case Simpsons murder trial, Macdonald constantly pilloried the former football star, often heavily implying Simpson was guilty of the brutal slaying of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson Nicole and her friend Ronald Goldman. In the broadcast following Simpsons acquittal, Macdonald opened "Weekend Update" by saying: "Well, it is finally official: Murder is legal in the state of California."

During the February 24, 1996, episode, Macdonald made a controversial joke about the sentencing of John Lotter, one of the two men who committed the notorious murder of Brandon Teena: "In Falls City, Nebraska, John Lotter has been sentenced to death for attempting to kill three people in what prosecutors called a plot to silence a cross-dressing female who had accused him of rape. Now this might strike some viewers as harsh, but I believe everyone involved in this story should die."<ref>{{cite book  title=Challenging Lesbian Norms: Intersex, Transgender, Intersectional, and Queer Perspectives first=Angela  last=Pattatucci Aragon  publisher=Routledge  page=28  year=2006  isbn=978-1-56023-645-0  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usruybRjfMUC&lpg=PA28&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite web first=Riki Anne  last=Wilchins  title=Subject: Saturday Night Live: Brandon Teena & Friends ...Deserved To Die. work=Qrd.org  publisher=Queer Resources Directory  date=February 28, 1996  url=http://www.qrd.org/qrd/trans/1996/snl.slur.response-02.28.96}}</ref>

After the announcement that Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley planned to divorce, Macdonald joked about their irreconcilable differences on "Weekend Update": "Shes more of a stay-at-home type, and hes more of a homosexual pedophile." He followed this up a few episodes later with a report about the singers collapse and hospitalization. Referring to a report that Jackson had decorated his hospital room with giant photographs of Shirley Temple, Macdonald remarked that viewers should not get the wrong idea, adding, "Michael Jackson is a homosexual pedophile."

On the April 12, 1997, show (host Rob Lowe, musical guest The Spice Girls), during a "Weekend Update" story about Tabitha Soren, Macdonald accidentally coughed in the middle of a sentence and muttered, "What the fuck was that?" The audience applauded, and Macdonald laughed the error away (saying at one point "My farewell performance" and, in closing, "Maybe well see you next week").

====Leaving SNL====
In early 1998, Don Ohlmeyer had Macdonald removed as "Weekend Update" anchor, citing declining ratings and a dropoff in quality. Macdonald and others believed that the real reason for his dismissal was his series of jokes calling O. J. Simpson a murderer during and after the O. J. Simpson murder case trial; Ohlmeyer was good friends with Simpson and supported him during the proceedings.<ref name=Carter>{{cite news title=TV Notes; Ohlmeyer Vs. Macdonald first=Bill last=Carter date=June 3, 1998 url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/03/arts/tv-notes-ohlmeyer-vs-macdonald.html publisher=New York Times}}</ref> 

After being removed from the role, Macdonald went on CBSs Late Show with David Letterman and Howard Sterns syndicated radio show accusing Ohlmeyer of firing him for making jokes about Simpson.<ref name=Carter/> The jokes were written primarily by Macdonald and longtime SNL writer Jim Downey (comedian) Jim Downey, who was fired from SNL outright at the same time. Downey pointed out in an interview that Ohlmeyer threw a party for the jurors who acquitted Simpson.<ref>{{cite web url=http://splitsider.com/2014/06/snls-james-downey-on-working-with-norm-macdonald-and-getting-fired-for-making-fun-of-oj-simpson title=SNLs James Downey on Working with Norm Macdonald and Getting Fired for Making Fun of OJ Simpson first=Mike last=Sacks date=June 24, 2014 accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref> Macdonald was replaced by Colin Quinn at the "Weekend Update" desk beginning on the January 10, 1998 episode.<ref>{{Cite news url=http://splitsider.com/2013/11/saturday-nights-children-norm-macdonald-1993-1998/ title=Saturday Night’s Children: Norm Macdonald (1993–1998) date=November 5, 2013 newspaper=Splitsider access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref> 

Ohlmeyer claimed that Macdonald was mistaken, pointing out that he had not censored Jay Lenos many jokes about Simpson on The Tonight Show.<ref name=Carter/> Ohlmeyer stated that he was concerned that ratings research showed people turning away from the program during Macdonalds segment, and network insiders told the New York Daily News that Ohlmeyer and other executives had tried several times to get Macdonald to try a different approach on "Update".<ref name="Honcho">{{cite news title=Gloves Off as Comic Rips NBC Honcho first=Eric last=Mink publisher=New York Daily News date=June 5, 1998 url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/gloves-comic-rips-nbc-honcho-article-1.794946}}</ref> Media watchers pointed out that if Macdonald had been viewed as unfunny by Lorne Michaels his removal would have occurred at the end of the season, without any media attention.<ref>{{cite news title=The Bizarre Circumstances And Shaky Aftermath Of Norm Macdonald’s Dismissal From Weekend Update first=John last=Hugar date=February 13, 2015 publisher=Uproxx url=http://uproxx.com/tv/norm-macdonald-snl-weekend-update-fired/}}</ref> 

Matters intensified when Ohlmeyer caused NBC to refuse to play MGMs advertisements for Macdonalds movie Dirty Work out of retaliation for what he saw as disparaging SNL and NBC with Letterman and Stern.<ref name="Carter"/> Ohlmeyers boss, Robert Wright, later overturned the decision not to show ads for the movie on NBC, but did leave in place the ban on playing it during SNL.<ref name=Frankel>{{cite news title=Norm Macdonald Wins "Dirty" War first=Daniel last=Frankel date=June 9, 1998 publisher=E! News url=http://www.eonline.com/news/36539/norm-macdonald-wins-dirty-war}}</ref> Macdonald continued to insist that he did not personally dislike Ohlmeyer but that Ohlmeyer hated him.<ref name=Frankel/>

Macdonald remained on SNL as a cast member, but he disliked performing in regular sketches. On February 28, 1998, in one of his last appearances on SNL, he played the host of a fictitious TV show called Whos More Grizzled? who asked questions of "mountain man mountain men" played by that nights host Garth Brooks and special guest Robert Duvall. In the sketch, Brookss character said to Macdonalds character, "I dont much care for you," to which Macdonald replied, "A lot of people dont." He was fired shortly thereafter.

Macdonald complained about the NBC advertising removal for his film to the New York Daily News, calling Ohlmeyer "a liar and a thug".<ref name=Honcho/> He said he never badmouthed SNL or Michaels, who he said always supported him. Macdonald pointed out that he had only taken issue with Ohlmeyer, while the people taking shots at NBC and SNL were Letterman (who wanted Macdonald to come to CBS) and Stern (who wanted him to join The Howard Stern Show (WWOR) his show opposite SNL).<ref name=Frankel/> Macdonald also asserted that Ohlmeyers influence had caused his promotional appearances for his film to be cancelled on WNBCs Today in New York, NBCs Late Night with Conan OBrien, and the syndicated Access Hollywood (a joint venture between 20th Century Television and NBC).<ref name=Honcho/> The shows Macdonald named denied being influenced by Ohlmeyer.<ref name=Honcho/> Macdonald said Ohlmeyer was "about a thousand times more powerful than I am. Its difficult for anybody to take my side in this. This guy should get a life, man."<ref name=Honcho/>

It was felt that there was some irony in the situation as Dirty Work was a revenge comedy. When an interviewer pointed this out Macdonald said "It would be good revenge if everybody went and saw this movie if they want to get revenge against Don Ohlmeyer for trying to ban my ads."<ref name=Frankel/>

In a Late Show with David Letterman interview, Macdonald said that after being dismissed from anchoring "Weekend Update" and leaving SNL, he could not "do anything else on any competing show."<ref>{{cite video people=Letterman, David title=Late Night with David Letterman medium=TV series publisher=CBS location=New York date=March 6, 1998 url=http://www.fakenews.net/archive/transcripts/1998_03_06_TLS.html accessdate=February 23, 2007}}</ref>

In later years Macdonald came to the conclusion that Ohlmeyer had not removed him from "Update" for his Simpson material. He told an interviewer that he felt he had been removed because people on the show stopped seeing him as funny: "I think the whole show was tired of me not taking marching orders. Lorne would hint at things...Id do Michael Jackson jokes. And Lorne would say, Do you really want a lawsuit from Michael Jackson? And Id say, Cool! Thatd be fuckin cool, Michael Jackson suing me!"<ref name=WTF>{{cite news publisher=Huffington Post title=Norm Macdonald On WTF: Lorne Michaels Wanted A Female Weekend Update Co-Anchor first=Ross last=Luippold date=October 18, 2011 url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/18/norm-macdonald-on-wtf-weekend-update_n_1018246.html}}</ref> Elsewhere Macdonald said, "In all fairness to him, my Update was not an audience pleasing, warm kind of thing. I did jokes that I knew werent going to get bigger reactions. So I saw [Ohlmeyers] point. Why would you want some dude whos not trying to please the audience?"<ref>{{cite web title=Maybe it Wasnt the O.J.

===After SNL===
Soon after leaving Saturday Night Live, Macdonald co-wrote and starred in the "revenge comedy" Dirty Work (1998 film) Dirty Work (1998), directed by Bob Saget and co-starring Artie Lange and featuring Chris Farley in his last movie; the film was dedicated to his memory. Later that year, Macdonald voiced the character of Lucky the dog in the Eddie Murphy adaptation of Dr. Dolittle (film) Dr. Dolittle. He reprised the role in both Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001) and Dr. Dolittle 3 (2006). Macdonald voiced the character of Death on an episode of Family Guy. Because of a conflict with his stand-up comedy schedule,{{citation needed date=September 2016}} he was unavailable to voice the character for his next appearance; Death has since been voiced by Adam Carolla.

Macdonald returned to Saturday Night Live to host the October 23, 1999 show. In his opening monologue, he expressed resentment at being fired from "Weekend Update", then concluded that the only reason he was asked to host was because "the show has gotten really bad" since he left,<ref>{{cite web  url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/99/99cmono.phtml  title=Norm Macdonalds Monologue  publisher=SNLTranscripts.jt.org  date=October 23, 1999 accessdate=February 2, 2007}}</ref> echoing a perennial criticism of the show. The next episode, airing November 6, 1999, and hosted by Dylan McDermott, featured a sketch wherein Chris Kattan, as the androgynous character Mango, is opening letters from celebrity admirers and, after opening the last one, says "[The letter is from] Norm Macdonald—who is that?" Earlier in 1999, Macdonald made a cameo appearance in the Andy Kaufman biographical drama Man on the Moon (film) Man on the Moon. When Michael Richards refused to portray himself in the scene reenacting the famous Fridays (ABC TV Series) Fridays Fridays (TV series)#Andy Kaufman incident incident in which Kaufman threw water in his face, Macdonald stepped in to play Richards, although he was not referred to by name.

In 2000, Macdonald played the starring role for the second time in a motion picture, Screwed (2000 film) Screwed, which fared poorly at the box office.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=screwed.htm title=Screwed website=Box Office Mojo accessdate=July 3, 2018}}</ref>

On November 12, 2000, he appeared on the Celebrity Edition of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, winning $500,000 for Paul Newmans Hole in the Wall Charity Camp.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDkJCvUIhoY  title=Norm on Millionaire Part 3  publisher=YouTube  date=October 28, 2006  accessdate=May 14, 2017}}</ref> Macdonald continued to make appearances on television shows and in films.

In 2005, Macdonald signed a deal with Comedy Central to create the sketch comedy Back to Norm, which debuted that May. The pilot was never turned into a series.

On May 15, 2015, Macdonald was the final stand-up act on the Late Show with David Letterman and included in his set a joke Letterman had told the first time Macdonald had ever seen him, during his appearance on a Canadian talk show, 90 Minutes Live, in the 1970s, where a teenaged Macdonald had been in the studio audience.<ref>{{cite news title=Norm Macdonald gives David Letterman an emotional, beautiful send-off url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/05/16/norm-macdonald-david-letterman-tribute accessdate=May 16, 2015 work=Entertainment Weekly date=May 16, 2015}}</ref> Also in 2015, Macdonald was a judge for the ninth season of NBCs Last Comic Standing, joining the previous seasons judges, Roseanne Barr and Keenan Ivory Wayans and replacing fellow Canadian Russell Peters from 2014.

As of May 2017, Macdonald has continued to evolve in his stand-up, moving towards a more reserved, deadpan style. On stage he has claimed to have "no opinions" and the minimalist delivery has been described by The A.V. Club as "reduc[ing] gesture and verbiage down to an absurd minimum."<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.avclub.com/review/norm-macdonald-owns-his-deadpan-minimalism-new-net-254787  first=Jesse  last=Hassenger  date=2017-05-10  title=Norm Macdonald owns his deadpan minimalism in new Netflix special accessdate=2017-06-28  publisher=The A.V.

==Influences and views on comedy==
Macdonald says his influences include Bob Newhart,<ref>Ridiculous, Norm Macdonald, 2006, Comedy Central Records</ref> Leo Tolstoy,<ref>{{cite interview  last=MacPherson  first=Guy  interviewer=Guy MacPherson  title=Whats So Funny?  url=http://wsf1027fm.blogspot.fi/2012/07/podcast-episode-287ish-norm-macdonald.html  date=July 23, 2012}}</ref> Bob Hope,<ref name="Hughezy">{{cite interview  last=Hughezy  first= interviewer=Hughezy  title=HughezyVSTheWorld  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsP355LvAN8  date=October 19, 2012}}</ref> Sam Kinison,<ref name="Hughezy"/> and Dennis Miller.<ref>{{cite interview  last=Miller  first=Dennis  interviewer=Dennis Miller  title=The Dennis Miller Show  last2=Macdonald  first2=Norm  url=http://www.dennismillerradio.com/b/SNL-Power-Hour:-Norm-MacDonald--Jason-Sudeikis!/819509015359385647.html  date=June 16, 2011  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629193547/http://www.dennismillerradio.com/b/SNL-Power-Hour:-Norm-MacDonald--Jason-Sudeikis!/819509015359385647.html  archivedate=June 29, 2013  df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Speaking about Canadas homegrown comedy industry, Macdonald reflected that he would have liked there to have been more opportunity for him to stay in the country early in his career, stating:
{{quote Now I know theres more of, like, an industry there. Like I was happy that Brent Butt got Corner Gas. Because hes a really funny guy. But there wasnt that opportunity when I was there. I remember Mike MacDonald had one Mosquito Lake (TV series) short-lived series, but that was about it. Otherwise there was nothing to do. But it was great with standup. It was way, way better with standup than in the States. Like, I think the standups are generally much better in Canada. Because, like, when I was in Canada, none of us had any ambition to movies or TV because there were no movies or television. So it was all standup and we just assumed wed be standups for our whole lives and that was what was fun. And then when I came to the States, I realized, whoa, they dont take their standup very seriously here because theyre just trying to do something other than standup and using standup as, like, a springboard to something else that theyre generally not as good at.<ref name="Phone"/>}}

Reflecting on the state of modern comedy, Macdonald bemoans the influx of dramatic actors into comedy and comedians into dramatic acting:
{{quote What young, handsome person is funny? I remember on Saturday Night Live hosts would come in. You know, like handsome hosts. Theyd be dramatic actors generally. And the publicist would always be like, "This is a big chance for this guy because hes really a funny guy and people dont know it. Hes hilarious!" And then hed just suck, you know?...I always liked Steve Martin when he was crazy. Because dramatic actors know how to be likeable and stuff. To me, if youve got a guy like Steve Martin or Jim Carrey or something, who are unbelievably funny, I dont know why theyd want to be dramatic actors when they have no chance. Theyre completely outclassed by actual dramatic actors. How many funny comedy actors are there? Theres like a million great dramatic actors. I dont know why theyd want to switch. I guess to get respect or something, I dont know.<ref name="Phone"/>}}

In his January 29th, 2018 Reddit AMA, Macdonald called Cormac McCarthy and Alice Munro the "two greatest living writers."<ref>{{cite interview  last=Macdonald  first=Norm  interviewer=Reddit AMA  title=Hi. Im Norm Macdonald. Im here to do my reddit AMA. Gene at The Washington Post is helping me today.  url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7ttism/hi_im_norm_macdonald_im_here_to_do_my_reddit_ama/  date=January 29, 2018}}</ref>

==Political views==
Despite referring to himself as Apoliticism apolitical, Macdonald has made political statements. At the end of the last Weekend Update segment before the United States presidential election, 1996 1996 presidential election, Macdonald urged viewers to vote for Bob Dole (of whom Macdonald frequently performed a comic impersonation), though hinting that he had solely said it so that he could continue impersonating him.

On the November 16, 2000, episode of The View (U.S. TV series) The View Macdonald said that he thought George W. Bush was "a decent man" and he called Bill Clinton a "murderer" (regarding the Vince Foster case). Macdonald later stated in Maxim magazine Maxim magazine that he is completely apolitical, and that he was joking when he said Clinton "killed a guy" (he further explained on The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio) The Adam Carolla Show that the comments were simply designed to anger Barbara Walters). In a phone interview, he later clarified his views on George W. Bush and the Iraq War thus: "I wish there was another president, a different president engaging the war, since were in the war because I dont think Bush did a very good job with it. The war itself, you know, if it works it was worth it. But I dont know if its going to work, so I dont know".<ref name="Phone">{{cite web url=http://www.comedycouch.com/interviews/nmacdonald.htm title= Norm Macdonald first=Guy  last=MacPherson date=January 17, 2006 publisher=(interview) ComedyCouch.com accessdate=October 3, 2010  archivedate=November 8, 2006   archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061108171818/http://comedycouch.com/interviews/nmacdonald.htm  deadurl=no}}</ref>

On December 29, 2003, Macdonald again appeared on The View and jokingly renounced his Canadian citizenship over his home countrys decision not to participate in the Iraq War. He furthermore stated his belief that Ronald Reagan was the greatest president ever and said he would become a naturalized citizen of the United States. In  2006 he affirmed he was joking about renouncing his Canadian citizenship, stating:
{{quote Im not an American nationality law American citizen. Im a Canadian citizen. I just keep renewing my Permanent residence (United States) green card. ... I dont want to be American. ...  I can vote in Canadian elections ... [but] I never did when I was in Canada... I never voted because I dont want to make a mistake. Im so uninformed that I dont want that on my hands, you know?<ref name="Phone"/>}}

In an interview in June  2017, Macdonald was asked if he finds satire involving Donald Trump funny, to which Macdonald responded, "Personally, with comedy, I think if it doesn’t make you laugh 100 years from now, what good is it? Have you listened to a Mort Sahl album lately? The Dwight D. Eisenhower Eisenhower stuff is a little weak." He added of Trump, "You know, people say stuff like, You gotta wake up. Trump and his boys are trying to take over. There’s a coup going on. Thats the most ridiculous thing Ive ever heard. I dont know much, but I know coups are not undertaken by the President of the United States. If anything, it looks like a coup going on the other way. They’re talking about impeaching a guy before any investigation has even begun."<ref>{{Cite news url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/06/norm-macdonald-special-donald-trump-snl.html title=Norm Macdonald on Why He’s Tired of Trump Satire and the Joke He’ll Never Tell Again publisher=Vulture.com (New York (magazine) New York) last=Marchese first= David date=June 5, 2017 access-date=January 22, 2018}}</ref>
