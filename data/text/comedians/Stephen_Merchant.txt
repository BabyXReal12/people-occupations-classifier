==Career==
===Pre–2001===
Merchant began his career performing stand-up comedy at Bristols Comedy Box, where, he recalls, "The first week I did really well. The second week I died on my arse. I realised that stand-up was not that easy after all."<ref>{{cite news  last1=Byrnes  first1=Sholto  title=Stephen Merchant: The Office boy  url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/stephen-merchant-the-office-boy-299623.html  accessdate=19 August 2018  work=Independent  date=17 July 2005}}</ref> He also appeared as a contestant on a 1997 episode of the TV game show Blockbusters (UK game show) Blockbusters<ref>{{cite web title=Ill have a TV career please, Bob: four famous Blockbusters contestants url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-05-14/ill-have-a-tv-career-please-bob-four-famous-blockbusters-contestants publisher=Radio Times accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref> and worked for a short time as a DJ for Radio Caroline.<ref>{{cite web title=Stephen Merchant url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/comics/s/33386/stephen_merchant?review=33386&type=3 publisher=Chortle accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref>

Merchant met Ricky Gervais for the first time in 1997, when Gervais (then in the position of "Head of Speech" at the London radio station XFM London) hired Merchant as his assistant.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news last1=Harvey first1=Chris title=Stephen Merchant interview: Ill probably get in trouble for saying this... url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-features/11700874/stephen-merchant-interview-mentalists.html accessdate=19 November 2015 work=Telegraph date=27 June 2015}}</ref> (Gervais said later that he had called Merchant for an interview simply because it was the first Curriculum vitae CV handed to him.) Merchant and Gervais hosted a Saturday afternoon radio show together from January through to August 1998, when both of them left XFM as it was bought by the Capital Radio Group. In the same year, Merchant was a finalist at the Daily Telegraph Open Mic Awards.<ref>{{cite web title=Stephen Merchant Stands Up url=http://londonist.com/2007/03/stephen_merchan publisher=Londonist accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref>

Merchant worked for seven years at XFM 104.9. The Saturday show never had a large audience; Gervais says "Its a tin pot radio station... Its not even the biggest radio station in the building." He created the features Hip Hop Hooray, Make Ricky Gervais Laugh and Song for the Ladies. After leaving XFM, Merchant began a production course at the BBC. As part of his coursework, he enlisted Gervais to perform in a 30-minute short film, "Seedy Boss," which became the earliest inspiration for their sitcom The Office (UK TV series) The Office.<ref>{{cite news last1=Jeffries first1=Stuart title=The Guardian profile: Ricky Gervais url=https://www.theguardian.com/profiles/story/0,,1250074,.html accessdate=19 November 2015 work=Guardian date=30 January 2004}}</ref> They collaborated on a sitcom pilot called Golden Years featuring a manager suffering a mid-life crisis; the pilot aired on Channel 4s Comedy Lab series in September 1998,<ref>{{cite web title=Comedy Lab: Season 2, Episode 6 Golden Years url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475285/ publisher=IMDB accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref> but failed to find further success.

===2001–2003 (The Office and return to XFM)===
In mid-2001, BBC Two aired the first series of The Office, co-written and co-directed by Merchant and Gervais and starring the latter as paper sales office manager David Brent; the show initially received low ratings. Beginning in September 2001, Merchant and Gervais returned to XFM as co-hosts of The Ricky Gervais Show, another Saturday afternoon programme, which led to their fruitful relationship with producer Karl Pilkington.<ref name=telegraph/>

They took a break from the radio show in mid-2002 in order to film the second series of The Office, which aired that year; in addition to writing and directing the show, Merchant made a cameo performance in the episode "Charity" as a friend of Gareth Keenans character known by the name Oggy or Oggmonster. (Merchants father also appears in multiple episodes as an office handyman named Gordon.) Merchant also directed a sitcom pilot called The Last Chancers, which aired on Comedy Lab in November 2002 and became a five-part series broadcast in December on E4 (channel) E4.<ref>{{cite web title=The Last Chancers url=http://curtisbrown.co.uk/client/anthony-macmurray/work/the-last-chancers-1 publisher=Curtis Brown accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref>

Merchant and Gervais continued to host The Ricky Gervais Show through 2003, taking another break to film the Office Christmas special, which aired that December. The radio show went off the air indefinitely in January 2004. During 2004, Merchant appeared in a recurring role as a chef on Garth Marenghis Darkplace and in a cameo on Green Wing, and served as a script associate on the Chris Morris (satirist) Chris Morris and Charlie Brooker sitcom Nathan Barley. The same year, The Office aired in the U.S. to critical acclaim. It went on to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy which both Merchant and Gervais accepted.<ref>{{cite web title=The Office celebrates two Golden Globe triumphs url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2004/01_january/office_golden_globes.shtml publisher=BBC accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref> This was followed in 2005 by a 4th series of the radio show, consisting of six episodes.

===U.S. series of The Office===
In March 2005, the The Office (U.S. TV series) American version of The Office premiered, with Merchant and Gervais credited as executive producers.

===Podcast series===
In December 2005, with sponsorship by The Guardian, Merchant, Gervais and Pilkington began recording a weekly podcast (also called The Ricky Gervais Show).<ref>{{cite web author=Plumplard.com August 2004 url=http://www.rickygervais.com/podcasts2.php title=Ricky Gervais...

Two more series and three special installments (the "Podfather Trilogy") were recorded in 2006, with the final episode released on Christmas Eve. In late 2008, they recorded four more podcasts and began a series of audiobooks examining Pilkingtons perspective on various subjects.<ref>{{cite web title=Stephen Merchant Talks url=http://www.iamrogue.com/news/interviews/item/8097-iar-exclusive-interview-stephen-merchant-talks-movie-43-the-future-of-an-idiot-abroad-and-the-genius-of-karl-pilkington.html publisher=I Am Rogue accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref>

===Extras===
In July 2005, following a brief return of the XFM radio show (filling in for Adam and Joe), Gervais and Merchants new sitcom Extras (TV series) Extras premiered on BBC2. The series features Merchant in a supporting role as Darren Lamb, the incompetent agent to struggling actor Andy Millman, played by Gervais. Series 2 of Extras aired in late 2006, followed by a Christmas special in December 2007; all three installments aired on HBO in the United States. Merchant won a 2006 British Comedy Award for Best TV Actor for his performance as Lamb.<ref>{{cite news author=Owen Gibson, media correspondent url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1971460,00.html title=Tate and Merchant win comedy awards work=The Guardian location=UK date=14 December 2006 accessdate=17 March 2010}}</ref>

Many of the songs on the show were suggested by listeners or co-presenters. The show also featured several of his friends, including his housemate,  his childhood friend, as well as actor Rufus Wright Rufus Gerrard-Wright (who also appeared in an episode of Extras (TV series) Extras). A spring search for a "she-J" resulted in the addition of former Byker Grove actor Sammy T.

===Stand-up===
Merchant began performing stand-up comedy in the late 1990s to critical success, though he decided to focus more on his work with writing partner Ricky Gervais after the success of The Office. Merchant returned to stand-up with a nationwide tour of the United Kingdom in September 2011, under the title Hello Ladies. The tour, which ended in New York,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/arts/television/stephen-merchant-moves-from-gervaiss-shadow-to-stand-up.html?_r=0 Profile], nytimes.com; accessed 8 March 2015.</ref> was later released on DVD.
