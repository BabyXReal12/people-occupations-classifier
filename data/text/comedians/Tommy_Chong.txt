As a youth, Tommy Chong moved with his family to Calgary, settling in a conservative neighbourhood Chong has referred to as "Dogpatch Dog Patch". He has said that his father had "been wounded in World War II, and there was a veterans hospital in Calgary. He bought a $500 house in Dog Patch and raised his family on $50 a week."<ref name="nardwuar"/> In an interview, Chong later said,
{{quote I dropped out of Crescent Heights High School (Calgary, Alberta) Crescent Heights High School when I was 16 but probably just before they were going to throw me out anyway&nbsp;... I played guitar to make money. I was about 16 when I discovered that music could get you sexual intercourse laid, even if you were a scrawny, long-haired, geeky-looking guy like me.<ref name="nardwuar"/>}}

==Career==

===Music===
By the early 1960s, Chong was playing guitar for a Calgary soul group called the Shades. The Shades moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where the bands name changed to "Little Daddy & the Bachelors". They recorded a single, "Too Much Monkey Business" / "Juniors Jerk". Together with bandmember Bobby Taylor, Chong opened a Vancouver nightclub in 1963.  Formerly the Alma Theatre, they called it "Blue Balls". They brought in the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, which had never been to Vancouver before. Although Little Daddy & the Bachelors built up a small following, things soured when they went with Chongs suggestion and had themselves billed as "Four Niggers and a Chink"<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web author=Hamilton, Andrew url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p130602 title=Bobby Taylor work=AllMusic}}</ref> (or, bowing to pressure, "Four Ns and a C") before taking on the moniker Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers.<ref name="allmusic" />

In 1965, the Vancouvers signed with Gordy Records (a subsidiary of Detroits Motown Records). They recorded their debut album, an eponymous release, and their debut single, the Tommy Chong co-composition, "Does Your Mama Know About Me," which peaked at number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 Billboard Hot 100.<ref name="allmusic" /> While on tour in Chicago for a short time, the band followed opening act the Jackson 5. Chong later referred to the young Michael Jackson as a "cute little guy".<ref name="tomgreen.com">{{cite web url=http://www.tomgreen.com/?video=1089 title=Tom Green - The Channel - WebovisionTom Green - The Channel publisher=}}</ref> After the band released two additional singles, Chong and Wes Henderson were fired by Chris Clark (singer) Chris Clark and Motown producer Johnny Bristol for missing an appointment to apply for Permanent residence (United States) Green cards to enable them to live in the US.<!--Above material apparently had been copied from article "Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers"--><ref name="harp">{{cite web

===Cheech & Chong===
{{Main Cheech & Chong}}
Chong co-wrote and performed on many Cheech & Chong comedy albums, four of which were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. He and Cheech Marin shared the 1973 award in this category for Los Cochinos.<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22cheech+and+chong%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All Cheech and Chong at grammy.com]</ref>

===After Cheech & Chong===
File:Tommy Chong in 2008.jpg thumb Chong speaking in San Francisco in 2008.
Cheech & Chong, while a very successful comedy act, split in 1985 due to creative differences and Marins desire to focus on a mainstream acting career. This began a difficult time for Chong. He did not act regularly until filling the recurring role (later a regular role) as the fun-loving, aging hippie "Leo (That 70s Show) Leo" (similar to his Chong character) on That 70s Show. Chong was absent during the fifth and sixth seasons of the show as he was serving a brief jail sentence; upon his release, he returned to the series for its final two seasons. He also played a role as a hippie in Dharma and Greg.

Chong was originally going to voice the character of Shenzi, Banzai and Ed Shenzi, the hyena in the Disney film The Lion King.{{citation needed  date=May 2018}} Cheech Marin voiced Banzai. (The Shenzi character was changed to a female, and voiced instead by Whoopi Goldberg.) Chong provided the voice of the character Yax in the 2016 Disney film Zootopia.<ref name="USA Today 25 October 2015">{{cite news   title= J.K.

In September 2005, a/k/a Tommy Chong premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. The documentary, produced, written and directed by Josh Gilbert, chronicles Chongs comedic and personal history. It includes material related to his prosecution by the United States Department of Justice US Justice Department and imprisonment. The project features interviews with Cheech Marin, Bill Maher, George Thorogood, Peter Coyote, Lou Adler, Eric Schlosser and Jay Leno. In 2011, Chong appeared as a Judge in an episode of Franklin & Bash.

On September 4, 2014, Chong was announced as one of the celebrities participating on the Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19) 19th season of Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series) Dancing with the Stars. He paired with professional dancer Peta Murgatroyd.<ref>{{cite web title=‘Dancing With The Stars: Season 19 Celebrity Contestants Revealed url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2014/09/04/dancing-with-the-stars-season-19-cast-dwts-celebrities/ publisher=Hollywood Life}}</ref> Despite being at the bottom of the leaderboard numerous times, Chong and Murgatroyd were able to make it to the night of the semi-finals but were eliminated at the end of that night.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/dancing-with-the-stars/dancing-with-the-stars-recap-t-55130.aspx title=Dancing with the Stars Recap: Top 5 in the Semifinals publisher= access-date=November 17, 2014 archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121103908/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/dancing-with-the-stars/dancing-with-the-stars-recap-t-55130.aspx archive-date=November 21, 2014 dead-url=yes df=mdy-all}}</ref> Chong is the oldest contestant to have made it to the semi-finals of the show.

On April 4, 2015, Chong was in Ann Arbor, Michigan, for the annual "Hash Bash" event which focuses on cannabis legalization. He was a guest speaker at this event, took pictures with fans and signed autographs.

In November 2017, Chong guest-starred as himself in an episode of the Trailer Park Boys spinoff Out of the Park: USA.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5937754/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast title=Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park publisher=IMDB}}</ref>

==Legal troubles==

===US vs. Chong===
In 2003 Chong became caught up in two American investigations, code-named Operation Pipe Dreams and Operation Headhunter, which tried to trace drug traffic and users through businesses selling drug paraphernalia, mostly bongs.  Operation Pipe Dream was run from Pittsburgh. US Attorney for Western Pennsylvania Mary Beth Buchanan oversaw the case. The estimated cost of Operation Pipe Dream was over $12 million and included the resources of 2,000 law enforcement officers.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news first=Steve last=Mikulan title=Chong Family Values date=December 4, 2003 publisher=LA Weekly Times url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/features/chong-family-values/2158/?page=2 archive-url=https://archive.is/20130127205521/http://www.laweekly.com/news/features/chong-family-values/2158/?page=2 dead-url=yes archive-date=January 27, 2013}}</ref> Fifty-five companies that sold drug paraphernalia over the Internet were the subject of the investigation, and Nice Dreams was one of them.

Chong was charged for his part in financing and promoting Chong Glass/Nice Dreams, a company started by his son Paris. His case never went to trial, as his attorney negotiated a plea agreement with the US Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvanias Office. He admitted to distributing 7,500 bongs and water pipes on the Internet through Nice Dreams, a family company. Chong agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute drug paraphernalia in exchange for non-prosecution of his wife, Shelby, and his son, Paris. Chong cooperated with the government and was the first of the Operation Pipe Dreams defendants to plead guilty.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

At Chongs sentencing, Assistant U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania Mary McKeen Houghton said in her arguments that Tommy Chong "used his public image to promote this crime" and marketed his products to children.<ref name="autogenerated4">{{cite news  author=Torsten Ove   title=Chong Actor Tommy Chong gets nine months for selling pot pipes  date=September 13, 2003   publisher= Pittsburgh Post Gazette  url= http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20030912chong0912p5.asp}}</ref> U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan also was present at the sentencing in Pittsburgh and released a statement to the press stating, "there are consequences for violating the law, even if the violator is a well-known entertainer like Thomas Chong."<ref name="autogenerated1" />

While Chong argued for community service and home detention at his sentencing, the district judge, Arthur J. Schwab, denied his requests and sentenced him to 9 months in federal prison, a fine of $20,000, forfeiture of $103,514, and the loss of all merchandise seized during the raid of his business.<ref name="autogenerated4" /> Chong served his sentence at the Taft Correctional Institution from October 8, 2003 to July 7, 2004. He was a cellmate—or "cubie"—with "The Wolf of Wall Street" Jordan Belfort, and is given credit for encouraging Belfort to write his memoirs. They have remained friends ever since.<ref name=NYMag>{{cite journal last=Gray first=Geoffrey title=The Wolf of Wall Street Cant Sleep journal=New York date=December 2, 2013 year= pages=64–69 url=http://nymag.com/news/features/jordan-belfort-2013-12/ accessdate=December 21, 2013}}</ref>

These events were among those chronicled in a/k/a Tommy Chong (2006), a documentary by Josh Gilbert (filmmaker) Josh Gilbert. It premiered theatrically at the New York Film Forum in New York City and won awards. His time in prison was also a main point in his book, "The I Chong".

===Controversy===
File:Tommy Chong by David Shankbone.jpg thumb Chong in 2006
While government officials denied that Chong was treated any differently from the other defendants, supporters felt his celebrity status was being used against him. Chongs publicist Brandie Knight said the Chong family was shocked by the raid. "Weve done everything the right way, and the government is saying there is no right way," Knight said.<ref>{{cite news title=U.S. raids firms selling items used by pot smokers / Ashcroft blames Internet for paraphernalia url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2003-02-25/news/17477256_1_operation-headhunter-head-shops-bongs/2 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301163234/http://articles.sfgate.com/2003-02-25/news/17477256_1_operation-headhunter-head-shops-bongs archivedate=March 1, 2011  publisher=San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> Supporters started the "Free Tommy Chong!" movement that called for his release. They questioned why Chong was prosecuted rather than his son Paris Chong, who was CEO of the business. They also pointed to the disparity in sentences between Chongs and those of other defendants and the DEA tactics used in the investigation.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Paris Chong had started Nice Dreams in 1999. He was never charged with his crimes in relation to the investigation as part of a plea bargain. When asked why the government had focused on Chong rather than his son the CEO, US Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan said that "Tommy Chong was the more responsible corporate officer because he financed and marketed the product."<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Of the 55 people who were subjects of the investigation, Chong was the only one without previous convictions who received jail time.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> When questioned on the sentencing, U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan noted that Chong had never gone to trial and made a plea bargain. She said, "He was a relatively new player, but he had the ability to market products like no other."<ref name="Tommy Chongs Bongs">{{cite news  author=Greg Beato   title=Tommy Chongs Bongs  date=May 2004   publisher= Reason Magazine  url= http://www.reason.com/news/show/29137.html}}</ref>

During its investigation of Nice Dreams, federal agents posed as head-shop owners from Beaver County, Pennsylvania Beaver County in western Pennsylvania. They asked Paris Chong to sell them Water pipe percolator pipes through the mail to a fictitious shop in the town of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania Beaver Falls, {{convert 31 mi km}} from Pittsburgh. Paris Chong had been prohibited from selling to Pittsburgh or anywhere in Western Pennsylvania because of the successful federal prosecution of Akhil Kumar Mishra and his wife, Rajeshwari, who had two head shops in the city.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Accounts differ as to who in Nice Dreams went against Chongs prohibition, or even if it had been made up by the defense, but the sales did take place to the agents. This enabled the U.S. Attorney to show jurisdiction in Pennsylvania for Chongs illegal activities, as opposed to California, which was the base for Nice Dreams.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

===Aftermath===
In December 2004, Chong was to appear in an off-Broadway show entitled The Marijuana-Logues, a parody of Eve Enslers The Vagina Monologues. His parole officer barred him from the show and the tour was cancelled, as audience members were smoking pot during performances. Such exposure would cause Chong to violate the terms of his parole.<ref name="The Marijuana-Logues up in smoke; Tommy Chong cancels tour">{{cite news author=Jake Coyle title="The Marijuana-Logues" up in smoke; Tommy Chong cancels tour  date=February 28, 2005  publisher=The Seattle Times url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002192319_webchong28.html}}</ref> In 2006, Chong published a memoir about his experiences in jail and his exploration of meditation, called The I Chong: Meditations from the Joint.

In 2010, Chong and Cyril Wecht appeared at a Democratic Party (United States) Democratic Party fundraiser in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to aid the campaign against Mary Beth Buchanan, the United States Attorney who prosecuted him. She was running as a Republican Party (United States) Republican candidate for the United States House of Representatives.<ref>{{Citation  last=Roddy  first=Dennis B.  title=Chong and Wecht form an unlikely alliance against Buchanan  newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette  date=May 6, 2010  url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10126/1056036-53.stm#ixzz0n7uLO400  accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> She was defeated in the Republican primary.

===Seizure of a/k/a Tommy Chong DVDs===
On May 7, 2008, federal agents raided Spectrum Labs in an investigation related to its "detoxification" products. The search was one of nine conducted for Operation True Test, an investigation being led by Buchanan, still the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. It targeted companies that sell so-called "masking products," intended to help drug-users pass employer drug tests. No federal law bans such products; they are regulated on a state-by-state basis. Of the nine search warrants issued, none was for businesses within Buchanans district.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite news  author=Paula Reed Ward  title=Buchanan picks new target: products that mask drug use  date=May 11, 2008  publisher=Pittsburgh Post Gazette  url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08132/880918-52.stm}}</ref>

Chong claimed that federal agents had seized 8,000–10,000 copies of the yet-to-be released documentary, a/k/a Tommy Chong, from Spectrum Labs, but their attorney said no DVDs were taken.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> In a press release, Chong said, "[The seizure of the DVDs is] a way to punish the distributor financially. Theres no way to get the DVDs back until the investigation is over." Chong said he did not have any ownership of the film.<ref name="raid">{{cite news  title=Actor Tommy Chong Claims Link to FBI Raids  date=May 8, 2008  publisher=Local 12.com  url=http://www.local12.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=06471fa4-66f2-4ffe-8ddf-8c7630326bad  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512153035/http://www.local12.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=06471fa4-66f2-4ffe-8ddf-8c7630326bad  archivedate=May 12, 2008  df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette later amended its story, saying that an "undisclosed number of DVDs was taken". It noted the government is not required to disclose a reason for the seizure as the raid was part of "an ongoing investigation".<ref name="autogenerated2" />

==Reuniting with Cheech==
