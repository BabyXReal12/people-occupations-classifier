Palin wrote most of his comedic material with fellow Python member Terry Jones. Before Monty Python, they had worked on other shows such as the Ken Dodd Show, The Frost Report, and Do Not Adjust Your Set. Palin appeared in some of the most famous Python sketches, including "Argument Clinic", "Dead Parrot sketch", "The Lumberjack Song", "The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python) The Spanish Inquisition", "Bicycle Repair Man" and "The Fish-Slapping Dance".

Palin continued to work with Jones after Python, co-writing Ripping Yarns. He has also appeared in several films directed by fellow Python Terry Gilliam and made notable appearances in other films such as A Fish Called Wanda (1988), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.<ref name="BAFTA">{{cite web url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1989/film/actor-in-a-supporting-role title=Film - Actor in a Supporting Role in 1989 publisher=BAFTA accessdate=11 January 2008}}</ref> In a 2005 poll to find The Comedians Comedian, he was voted the 30th favourite by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.<ref>[https://movies.yahoo.com/person/michael-palin/ Michael Palin Biography] Yahoo.com.

==Early career==
After finishing university in 1965 Palin became a presenter on a comedy pop show called Now! for the television contractor Television Wales and the West.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/510300/index.html  title=Michael Palin first=John  last=Oliver  work=BFI Screen Online accessdate= 13 December 2006}}</ref> At the same time Palin was contacted by Jones, who had left university a year earlier, for assistance in writing a theatrical documentary about sex through the ages.<ref>{{cite web url=http://idler.co.uk/conversations/in-conversation-with-michael-palin/  first=Tom  last=Hodgkinson  work=The Idler  title=In Conversation with Michael Palin  year=2006  accessdate=20 December 2006  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103064336/http://idler.co.uk/conversations/in-conversation-with-michael-palin/  archivedate=3 January 2008  df= }}</ref> Although this project was eventually abandoned, it brought Palin and Jones together as a writing duo and led them to write comedy for various BBC programmes, such as The Ken Dodd Show, The Billy Cotton Bandshow, and The Illustrated Weekly Hudd.<ref>{{cite web url=http://orangecow.org/pythonet/michael-palin.html  title=Biography  website=Pythonet.org  accessdate=17 December 2006  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115215629/http://orangecow.org/pythonet/michael-palin.html  archivedate=15 November 2006  df= }}</ref> They collaborated in writing lyrics for an album by Barry Booth called Diversions. They were also in the team of writers working for The Frost Report, whose other members included Frank Muir, Barry Cryer, Marty Feldman, Ronnie Barker, Ronnie Corbett, Dick Vosburgh and future Monty Python members Graham Chapman, John Cleese and Eric Idle. Although the members of Monty Python had already encountered each other over the years, The Frost Report was the first time all the British members of Monty Python (its sixth member, Terry Gilliam, was at that time an American citizen) worked together.<ref name="ind120729"/> During the run of The Frost Report the Palin/Jones team contributed material to two shows starring John Bird (actor) John Bird: The Late Show and A Series of Birds. For A Series of Birds the Palin/Jones team had their first experience of writing narrative instead of the short sketches they were accustomed to conceiving.<ref>{{cite web   url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/seriesofbirdsa_1299002783.shtml   title = A Series of Birds   publisher = BBC Guide to Comedy   accessdate = 16 September 2006   archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070203114420/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/seriesofbirdsa_1299002783.shtml   archive-date = 3 February 2007   dead-url = yes   df = dmy-all }}</ref>

Following The Frost Report the Palin/Jones team worked both as actors and writers on the show Twice a Fortnight with Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie and Jonathan Lynn, and the successful childrens comedy show Do Not Adjust Your Set with Idle and David Jason. The show also featured musical numbers by the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, including future Monty Python musical collaborator Neil Innes. The animations for Do Not Adjust Your Set were made by Terry Gilliam. Eager to work with Palin<ref>Ross, 91</ref> sans Jones, Cleese later asked him to perform in How to Irritate People together with Chapman and Tim Brooke-Taylor. The Palin/Jones team were reunited for The Complete and Utter History of Britain.

===Monty Python===
{{Main Monty Python}}
On the strength of their work on The Frost Report and other programmes, Cleese and Chapman had been offered a show by the BBC, but Cleese was reluctant to do a Double act two-man show for various reasons, among them Chapmans reputedly difficult personality. During this period Cleese contacted Palin about doing the show that would ultimately become Monty Pythons Flying Circus.<ref name="ind120729"/> At the same time the success of Do Not Adjust Your Set had led Palin, Jones, Idle and Gilliam to be offered their own series and, while it was still in production, Palin agreed to Cleeses proposal and brought along Idle, Jones and Gilliam. Thus the formation of the Monty Python troupe has been referred to as a result of Cleeses desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.<ref name="Python Autobiography"/>

In Monty Python, Palin played various roles, which ranged from manic enthusiasm (such as the lumberjack of the Lumberjack Song, or Herbert Anchovy, host of the game show "Blackmail") to unflappable calmness (such as the Dead Parrot sketch Dead parrot vendor or Cheese Shop sketch Cheese Shop proprietor). As a Double act straight man he was often a foil to the rising ire of characters portrayed by John Cleese. He also played timid, socially inept characters such as Arthur Putey, the man who sits quietly as a marriage counsellor (Eric Idle) makes love to his wife (Carol Cleveland), and Mr. Anchovy, a chartered accountant who wants to become a lion tamer. He also appeared as the "Its" man at the beginning of most episodes.

Palin frequently co-wrote sketches with Terry Jones and also initiated the "The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python) Spanish Inquisition sketch", which included the catchphrase "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!"
He also composed songs with Jones including "The Lumberjack Song", "Every Sperm is Sacred" and "Spam (Monty Python) Spam". His solo musical compositions included "Decomposing Composers" and "Finland (comedy song) Finland".<ref>{{cite web first=Kathleen C. last=Fennessy url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r82483 title=Monty Python Sings – Monty Python: Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards work=AllMusic publisher=All Media Network location=San Francisco, California}}</ref>

==Other work==

After the Monty Python television series ended in 1974, the Palin/Jones team worked on Ripping Yarns, an intermittent television comedy series broadcast over three years from 1976. They had earlier collaborated on the play Secrets (play) Secrets from the BBC series Black and Blue (TV series) Black and Blue in 1973. He starred as Dennis the Peasant in Terry Gilliams 1977 film Jabberwocky (film) Jabberwocky. Palin also appeared in All You Need Is Cash (1978) as Eric Manchester (based on Derek Taylor), the press agent for the Rutles. In 1980, Palin co-wrote Time Bandits with Terry Gilliam. He also acted in the film.

In 1982, Palin wrote and starred in The Missionary, co-starring Maggie Smith. In it, he plays the Reverend Charles Fortescue, who is recalled from Africa to aid prostitutes. He co-starred with Maggie Smith again in the 1984 comedy film A Private Function. In 1984, he reunited with Terry Gilliam to appear in Brazil (1985 film) Brazil. He appeared in the comedy film A Fish Called Wanda, for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.<ref name="BAFTA" /> Cleese reunited the main cast almost a decade later to make Fierce Creatures. After filming for Fierce Creatures finished, Palin went on a travel journey for a BBC documentary and, returning a year later, found that the end of Fierce Creatures had failed at test screenings and had to be reshot.

Until "The Death of Stalin" in 2017, and with the exception of several made-for-TV films and voice work for animations, Palins last film role was a small part in The Wind in the Willows (1996 film) The Wind in the Willows, a film directed by and starring Terry Jones. Palin also appeared with John Cleese in his documentary, The Human Face. Palin was cast in a supporting role in the Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan romantic comedy Youve Got Mail, but his role was eventually cut entirely.<ref>{{cite web first=Hans last=ten Cate url=http://www.dailyllama.com/news/1999/llama088.html  title=NEWS 1999_01_17 – Michael Palin Dropped From Final Print of Hanks/Ryan Romantic Comedy  publisher=Daily Llama  date=17 January 1999  accessdate=1 June 2011}}</ref> He also assisted Campaign for Better Transport (UK) Campaign for Better Transport and others with campaigns on sustainable transport, particularly those relating to urban areas, and has been president of the campaign since 1986.<ref>[http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/take_action/see_michael_palin Campaign for Better Transport website] {{webarchive  url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017022350/http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/take_action/see_michael_palin  date=17 October 2008 }}</ref>

Palin has also appeared in serious drama. In 1991 Palin worked as producer and actor in the film American Friends based upon a real event in the life of his great-grandfather, a fellow at St Johns College, Oxford.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_friends/  title=American Friends website= Rotten Tomatoes.com accessdate= 13 December 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2015/22-may/features/features/michael-palin-my-seven-of-the-best title=Michael Palin: my seven of the best website=www.churchtimes.co.uk access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref> In that same year he also played the part of a headmaster in Alan Bleasdales Channel 4 drama series G.B.H. (TV drama) GBH.

Palin also had a small cameo role in Australian soap opera Home and Away. He played an English surfer with a fear of sharks, who interrupts a conversation between two main characters to ask whether there were any sharks in the sea. This was filmed while he was in Australia for the Full Circle series, with a segment about the filming of the role featuring in the series. In November 2005, he appeared in the John Peels Record Box documentary.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814163/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 "John Peels Record Box"], 2005</ref>

In 2013 Michael Palin appeared in a First World War drama titled The Wipers Times written by Ian Hislop and Nick Newman.<ref>{{cite news author= url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23128507 accessdate=2 July 2013 title=Python Palin stars in BBC WWI drama  work=BBC News}}</ref> At the Cannes Film Festival in 2016, it was announced that Palin was set to star alongside Adam Driver in Terry Gilliams The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.<ref>{{cite web first=Craig last=Skinner url=http://www.flickreel.com/terry-gilliams-the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-to-star-adam-driver-and-michael-palin-new-concept-art-uncovered/ title=EXCLUSIVE: TERRY GILLIAM’S THE MAN WHO KILLED DON QUIXOTE TO STAR ADAM DRIVER AND MICHAEL PALIN; NEW CONCEPT ART UNCOVERED work=Flickreel.com date=11 May 2016}}</ref> Palin, however, dropped out of the film after it ran into a financial problem.<ref>{{cite news first=Dave last=Itzkoff url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/arts/television/michael-palin-monty-python-remember-me-pbs.html title=Nobody Expects Michael Palin: A Comic Actor in a Dramatic Role  work=The New York Times publisher=New York Times Company location=New York City date=June 28, 2017 accessdate=July 5, 2017}}</ref>

===Activism===
In July 2010, Palin sent a message of support for the Dongria Kondh tribe of India, who are resisting mining on their land by the company Vedanta Resources. Palin said, "Ive been to the Nyamgiri Hills in Odisha Orissa and seen the forces of money and power that Vedanta Resources have arrayed against a people who have occupied their land for thousands of years, who husband the forest sustainably and make no great demands on the state or the government. The tribe I visited simply want to carry on living in the villages that they and their ancestors have always lived in".<ref>[http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/6269 Michael Palin sends message to support Dongria Kondh], Survival International</ref>

On 2 January 2011, Palin became the first person to sign the UK-based Campaign for Better Transports Fair Fares Now campaign. In July 2015, Palin signed an open letter and gave an interview to support "a strong BBC at the centre of British life" at a time the government was reviewing the corporations size and activities.<ref>{{cite news   url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-33547098   title= Michael Palin: BBC still lets us experiment   work=BBC News   date=16 July 2015   accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref>

==Television documentaries==
===Travel===
Palins first travel documentary was segment 4 of the 1980 BBC Television series Great Railway Journeys of the World, entitled Confessions of a Trainspotter.  Throughout the hour long show, Palin humorously reminisces about his childhood hobby of train spotting, while he travels throughout the UK by train, from London to the Kyle of Lochalsh, via Manchester, York, Newcastle upon Tyne, Edinburgh and Inverness. He rides vintage train lines and trains including LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman Flying Scotsman.  At the Kyle of Lochalsh, Palin bought the stations long metal platform sign and is seen lugging it back to London with him.

In 1994, Palin travelled through Ireland for the same series, entitled "Derry to Kerry". In a quest for family roots, he attempted to trace his great grandmother&nbsp;– Brita Gallagher&nbsp;– who set sail from Ireland {{round {{age format=raw 1847 1 1}} -1}} years ago during the Great Irish Famine Great Famine (1845–1849), bound for a new life in Burlington, New Jersey Burlington, New Jersey. The series is a trip along the Palin family line.

Starting in 1989, Palin appeared as presenter in a series of travel programmes made for the BBC. It was after the veteran TV globetrotter Alan Whicker and journalist Miles Kington turned down presenting the first of these, Around the World in 80 Days, that gave Palin the opportunity to present his first and subsequent travel shows.<ref>{{cite news url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200508/ai_n14903488/pg_1  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601220419/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200508/ai_n14903488/pg_1  dead-url=yes  archive-date=1 June 2013  title=Watching over Whicker  publisher=Findarticles.com  date=6 August 2005  accessdate=25 October 2008   first=Michael   last=Vestey}}</ref> These programmes have been broadcast around the world in syndication, and were also sold on VHS tape and later on DVD:

* Michael Palin: Around the World in 80 Days (Travel 1988; Programme release 1989): travelling as closely as possible the path described in the famous Jules Verne story without using aircraft.
* Pole to Pole (Travel 1991; Programme release 1992): travelling from the North Pole to the South Pole, following as closely as possible the 30-degree line of longitude, over as much land as possible, i.e., through Europe and Africa.
* Full Circle with Michael Palin (Travel 1995/96; Programme release 1997): in which he circumnavigated the lands around the Pacific Ocean anti-clockwise; a journey of almost {{convert 50000 mi km}} starting on Little Diomede Island in the Bering Strait and taking him through Asia, Oceania and the Americas.
* Michael Palins Hemingway Adventure (1999): retracing the footsteps of Ernest Hemingway through the United States, Europe, Africa and the Caribbean.
* Sahara with Michael Palin (Travel 2001/02; Programme release 2002): in which he trekked around and through the worlds Sahara largest desert.
* Himalaya with Michael Palin (Travel 2003/04; Programme release 2004): in which he travels through the Himalaya Himalaya region.
* Michael Palins New Europe (Travel 2006/07; Programme release 2007): in which he travels through Central Europe Central and Eastern Europe.
* Brazil with Michael Palin (2012) in which he travels through Brazil.

Following each trip, Palin wrote a book about his travels, providing information and insights not included in the TV programme. Each book is illustrated with photographs by Basil Pao, the stills photographer who was on the team. (Exception: the first book, Around the World in 80 Days, contains some pictures by Pao but most are by other photographers.)

All seven of these books were also made available as audio books, and all of them are read by Palin himself. Around the World in 80 Days and Hemingway Adventure are unabridged, while the other four books were made in both abridged and unabridged versions, although the unabridged versions can be very difficult to find.{{Citation needed date=November 2010}}

For four of the trips a photography book was made by Pao, each with an introduction written by Palin. These are large coffee-table style books with pictures printed on glossy paper. The majority of the pictures are of various people encountered on the trip, as informal portraits or showing them engaged in some interesting activity. Some of the landscape photos are displayed as two-page spreads.

Palins travel programmes are responsible for a phenomenon termed the "Palin effect": areas of the world that he has visited suddenly become popular tourist attractions&nbsp;– for example, the significant increase in the number of tourists interested in Peru after Palin visited Machu Picchu.<ref>{{cite news   first=Ben   last=Webster   title=Globetrotter Palin brought down to earth by eco-lobby date=14 January 2005   url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article788287.ece   work=The Times   accessdate =14 August 2006   location=London}}</ref> In a 2006 survey of "15 of the worlds top travel writers" by The Observer, Palin named Perus Pongo de Mainique (canyon below the Machu Picchu) his "favourite place in the world".<ref>{{cite news   author=Wilkinson, Carl   date=8 January 2006   title=My favourite place in the world  work=The Observer  location=UK   url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/jan/08/observerescapesection5

Palin notes in his book of Around the World in 80 Days that the final leg of his journey could originally have taken him and his crew on one of the trains involved in the Clapham Junction rail crash, but they arrived ahead of schedule and caught an earlier train.

===Art and history===
File:An evening with Michael Palin.jpg thumb right Palin in 2015
In recent years, Palin has written and presented occasional documentary programmes on artists that interest him. The first, on Scottish people Scottish painter Anne Redpath, was Palin on Redpath in 1997. In The Bright Side of Life (2000), Palin continued on a Scottish theme, looking at the work of the Scottish Colourists. Two further programmes followed on European painters; Michael Palin and the Ladies Who Loved Matisse (2004) and Michael Palin and the Mystery of Hammershøi (2005), about the French artist Henri Matisse and Danes Danish artist Vilhelm Hammershøi respectively. The DVD Michael Palin on Art contains all these documentaries except for the Henri Matisse Matisse programme.

In November 2008, Palin presented a First World War documentary about Armistice Day, 11 November 1918, when thousands of soldiers lost their lives in battle after the war had officially ended. Palin filmed on the battlefields of Northern France and Belgium for the programme, called the Last Day of World War One, produced for the BBCs Timewatch series.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/timewatch/last-day-of-ww1.shtml  title=Timewatch&nbsp;– The Last Day of World War One  publisher=BBC   accessdate=1 November 2008}}</ref>
