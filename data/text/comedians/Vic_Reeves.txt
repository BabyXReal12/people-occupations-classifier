James Roderick Moir (born 24 January 1959), better known by the stage name Vic Reeves, is an English comedian, artist, actor and television presenter, best known for his double act with Bob Mortimer (see Vic and Bob). He is known for his surrealism surreal and Non sequitur (literary device) non sequitur sense of humour.

In 2003, Reeves and Mortimer were listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. In a 2005 poll to find the Comedians Comedian, Reeves and Mortimer were voted the 8th greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4141019.stm   work=BBC News   title=Cook voted comedians comedian   date=2 January 2005   accessdate=27 May 2010}}</ref>

==Career==
After school, Reeves undertook an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering at a factory in Newton Aycliffe.<ref>CITATION NEEDED</ref> Eventually he moved to London.

Reeves also formed the Fashionable Five, a group of five friends (including Jack Dent, who ran the original Fan Club) who would follow bands like the Enid and Free (band) Free onto stage, and perform pranks (including Reeves pretending to have a brass hand, and following a Terry Scott lookalike around Darlington town centre in single file formation). Eventually, they formed their own band. Reeves had an early breakthrough with the help of comedian Malcolm Hardee.

In 1983, Reeves began a part-time course at a local art college, developed his love of painting and eventually persuaded a local art gallery to stage an Art exhibition exhibition of his work. Although still primarily known as a comedian, Reeves is gaining a reputation as an artist. His drawings and paintings have been used in his television shows and form a major part of his 1999 book, Sun Boiled Onions.

These included a loudmouthed American called Jim Bell, a beat poet called Mister Mystery and, eventually, "The North-Easts Top Light Entertainment Light Entertainer" – Vic Reeves. His stage show Vic Reeves Big Night Out began life as a regular Thursday night gig at Goldsmiths Tavern, New Cross (now the New Cross House).

His next appearance was on the short-lived chat/comedy show One Hour with Jonathan Ross in a game show segment known as Knock Down Ginger.

It was about this time that Reeves and Mortimer rented a back room at Jools Hollands office/recording studio in Westcombe Park, Greenwich where they would spend hours writing material.

The name Reeves is due to his fondness of the late American singer Jim Reeves.

==Art==
Alongside his comedy, Reeves is a serious artist, although the two often combine. Reeves works in many media including painting, ceramics, photography and lino prints, and has a distinctive style.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.eyestorm.com/Pages/Magazine.aspx/VIC_REEVES___%7C___NEW_LINO_CUT_PRINTS/373  title=Vic Reeves lino cut prints}}</ref> His work has been described as Dada-esque, surreal and sometimes macabre. For Reeves, his art and comedy are different ways of expressing the same idea. He says "I think putting your imagination on canvas or a television screen is the same thing"<ref name="Strand">{{cite web  url=https://thestrandgallery.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/coming-up-hot-valve-leak-visual-ramblings-of-vic-reeves  title=Hot Valve Leak at the Strand Gallery}}</ref> and "I dont differentiate between painting, acting or comedy. I think everything I do is art."<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-13060135  title=Vic Reeves puts 250 artworks on sale}}</ref> Reeves has stated that he is an artist first and a comedian second, and that in ten years time he would like to be remembered for his art and writing, rather than his comedy.<ref name="Strand" /><ref name="Curious" />

Much like his comedy, Reeves is not one to analyse his artworks. He has said that art should be "just for laughs"<ref name="SOP 254" /> and that he dislikes people looking for statements in his work, because there are none. "If something makes me laugh, thats it."<ref name="Having a laugh">{{cite web last1=Burkeman first1=Oliver title=Having a laugh url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/sep/28/artsfeatures3 accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref> "Ive done straight drawings and paintings ... and I havent got as much pleasure out of them as if Id done something that would make me laugh."<ref>{{cite web last1=Leo first1=Benedictus title=When something goes down the pan, enjoy it url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/05/biography.comedy accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref> His work has been described by artists Jake and Dinos Chapman as "able to command our laughter as a purgative, to encourage the viewer to leak at both ends".<ref name="Call Me Dada">{{cite web last1=Baker first1=Lindsay title=Call Me Dada url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/jun/22/artsfeatures.features2 accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref> Artist Damien Hirst, a friend of Reeves, has also described Reeves as an influence.<ref name="SOP 254">{{cite book last1=Thompson first1=Ben title=Sunshine On Putty date=2004 publisher=Harper Perennial location=London isbn=0 00 718132 9 page=254}}</ref><ref>{{cite book last1=Dessau first1=Bruce title=Reeves & Mortimer date=1998 publisher=Orion Media location=London isbn=0-75281-781-7 page=162}}</ref> This crossover of comedy and art often features within Reeves and Mortimers television shows. A notable example is The Smell of Reeves and Mortimers first episode. Several of Reeves drawings are featured, illustrating the lyrics of the opening song. (These drawings would later be published within his book Sun Boiled Onions.) As seen in the script book for the show, Reeves often drew sketches for the BBCs costume and set designers saying that "if we just tell them what we want, it never ends up looking like it does in our minds".<ref name="GQ 1" />

===Background and education===
Arts and crafts played a large part in Reeves upbringing. His mother and father, a seamstress and typesetting typesetter by trade, made extra money by selling handmade wooden crafts and Ceramic art ceramics at local markets.<ref name="M:M 171-172">{{cite book last1=Reeves first1=Vic title=Me: Moir date=2006 publisher=Virgin location=London isbn=1-85227-350-X  pages=171–172}}</ref> Building on these money-making schemes, Reeves began charging for his own artistic services such as customising and painting his school friends Haversack bags<ref>{{cite book last1=Reeves first1=Vic title=Me: Moir date=2006 publisher=Virgin location=London isbn=1-85227-350-X  pages=133–134}}</ref> and elaborately Embroidery embroidering clothing.<ref name="M:M 171-172" /> Later he would go on to Art forgery forge artworks his acquaintances liked with the aim of selling them to them.<ref name="Having a laugh" /> Wanting to study art, but being pressured into work, Reeves began a five-year engineering apprenticeship at a factory in Newton Aycliffe with the aim of working in their technical drawings department.<ref>{{cite book last1=Reeves first1=Vic title=Me: Moir date=2006 publisher=Virgin location=London isbn=1-85227-350-X  pages=213–214}}</ref>

After completing the apprenticeship, Reeves applied to Goldsmiths College in London to study art, but failed to get a place. He has admitted to sneaking in and using their equipment regardless.<ref>{{cite book last1=Thompson first1=Ben title=Sunshine On Putty date=2004 publisher=Harper Perennial location=London isbn=0 00 718132 9 page=253}}</ref> In 1983 he completed a one-year foundation course at Sir John Cass College, where he is now an honorary graduate.<ref>{{cite web title=Hot Valve Leak url=http://www.thecass.com/news-events/2013/february/hot-valve-leak accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref> Once leaving college, he worked as a curator at The Garden Gallery, an independent London gallery.
