James Roderick Moir (born 24 January 1959), better known by the stage name Vic Reeves, is an English comedian, artist, actor and television presenter, best known for his double act with Bob Mortimer (see Vic and Bob). He is known for his surrealism surreal and Non sequitur (literary device) non sequitur sense of humour.

In 2003, Reeves and Mortimer were listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. In a 2005 poll to find the Comedians Comedian, Reeves and Mortimer were voted the 8th greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.
==Career==
After school, Reeves undertook an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering at a factory in Newton Aycliffe.
Eventually he moved to London.

Reeves also formed the Fashionable Five, a group of five friends (including Jack Dent, who ran the original Fan Club) who would follow bands like the Enid and Free (band) Free onto stage, and perform pranks (including Reeves pretending to have a brass hand, and following a Terry Scott lookalike around Darlington town centre in single file formation). Eventually, they formed their own band. Reeves had an early breakthrough with the help of comedian Malcolm Hardee.

In 1983, Reeves began a part-time course at a local art college, developed his love of painting and eventually persuaded a local art gallery to stage an Art exhibition exhibition of his work. Although still primarily known as a comedian, Reeves is gaining a reputation as an artist. His drawings and paintings have been used in his television shows and form a major part of his 1999 book, Sun Boiled Onions.

===As Vic Reeves===
As well as working and performing in bands in London, including being an original member of the Industrial/Experimental band Test Dept
and performing onstage with them at their debut gig (then leaving soon afterwards), Reeves also joined the alternative comedy circuit under many different guises. These included a loudmouthed American called Jim Bell, a beat poet called Mister Mystery and, eventually, "The North-Easts Top Light Entertainment Light Entertainer" – Vic Reeves. His stage show Vic Reeves Big Night Out began life as a regular Thursday night gig at Goldsmiths Tavern, New Cross (now the New Cross House).

It was about this time that Reeves and Mortimer rented a back room at Jools Hollands office/recording studio in Westcombe Park, Greenwich where they would spend hours writing material.

==Art==
Alongside his comedy, Reeves is a serious artist, although the two often combine. Reeves works in many media including painting, ceramics, photography and lino prints, and has a distinctive style.
His work has been described as Dada-esque, surreal and sometimes macabre. For Reeves, his art and comedy are different ways of expressing the same idea. He says "I think putting your imagination on canvas or a television screen is the same thing"
and "I dont differentiate between painting, acting or comedy. I think everything I do is art."
Reeves has stated that he is an artist first and a comedian second, and that in ten years time he would like to be remembered for his art and writing, rather than his comedy.
Much like his comedy, Reeves is not one to analyse his artworks. He has said that art should be "just for laughs"
and that he dislikes people looking for statements in his work, because there are none. "If something makes me laugh, thats it."
"Ive done straight drawings and paintings ... and I havent got as much pleasure out of them as if Id done something that would make me laugh."
His work has been described by artists Jake and Dinos Chapman as "able to command our laughter as a purgative, to encourage the viewer to leak at both ends".
Artist Damien Hirst, a friend of Reeves, has also described Reeves as an influence.
This crossover of comedy and art often features within Reeves and Mortimers television shows. A notable example is The Smell of Reeves and Mortimers first episode. Several of Reeves drawings are featured, illustrating the lyrics of the opening song. (These drawings would later be published within his book Sun Boiled Onions.) As seen in the script book for the show, Reeves often drew sketches for the BBCs costume and set designers saying that "if we just tell them what we want, it never ends up looking like it does in our minds".
===Background and education===
Arts and crafts played a large part in Reeves upbringing. His mother and father, a seamstress and typesetting typesetter by trade, made extra money by selling handmade wooden crafts and Ceramic art ceramics at local markets.
Building on these money-making schemes, Reeves began charging for his own artistic services such as customising and painting his school friends Haversack bags
and elaborately Embroidery embroidering clothing.
Later he would go on to Art forgery forge artworks his acquaintances liked with the aim of selling them to them.
Wanting to study art, but being pressured into work, Reeves began a five-year engineering apprenticeship at a factory in Newton Aycliffe with the aim of working in their technical drawings department.
After completing the apprenticeship, Reeves applied to Goldsmiths College in London to study art, but failed to get a place. He has admitted to sneaking in and using their equipment regardless.
In 1983 he completed a one-year foundation course at Sir John Cass College, where he is now an honorary graduate.
Once leaving college, he worked as a curator at The Garden Gallery, an independent London gallery. It was there that he held his first art exhibition in 1985, with the help of a grant from Lewisham Council.
===Published work and exhibitions===
Reeves has released two books of his art, Sun Boiled Onions in 1999 and Vic Reeves Vast Book of World Knowledge in 2009. His drawings also appear in his autobiography Me:Moir Volume One, and the published script book for The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer.
He provided thirty illustrations for Random Houses 2011 reprint of Jerome K. Jeromes classic story "Three Men in a Boat".
He was also commissioned to create several celebrity drawings for Jools Hollands Channel 5 (UK) Channel 5 series "Name That Tune".
Reeves has hosted several exhibitions of his artwork, including:
*Sun Boiled Onions (2000) at the Percy Miller Gallery
*Doings (2002) at the Whitechapel Gallery, London
*My Family and Other Freaks (2007) at the Eyestorm Gallery, London
*Where Eagles Tremble (2009) at Mews of Mayfair, London
*Hot Valve Leak: Visual Ramblings of Vic Reeves (2013) at the Strand Gallery, London
In 2010, a selection of Reeves paintings were displayed at the Saatchi Gallery, London as part of an exhibition by charity The Art of Giving. He was also a judge for the charitys open art competition.
In 2012, Reeves took part in the Illuminating York festival. His illuminations, known as "Wonderland", were projected across a number of historic buildings including the Yorkshire Museum, St Marys Abbey, York St Marys Abbey, and the ten-acre site of York Museum Gardens.
==Music==

Before finding fame with his comedy, Reeves was a member of several bands with many different names and musical styles, in which he usually played bass guitar and/or sang.
He sold tapes of his early material in the back pages of NME magazine under the name "International Cod".
Mark Lamarr, later to become team captain of Shooting Stars (TV series) Shooting Stars, was sent an early tape of Reeves’ band "Fantantiddlyspan",
whose song "Fantasia" was played on Never Mind the Buzzcocks by Lamarr in 1998, in an attempt to embarrass him.
As part of early Vic Reeves Big Night Out Big Night Out performances, Reeves would sometimes hand out promotional materials to the audience. On one occasion he handed out a 7" flexi disc of original song "The Howlin’ Wind".
Having surplus copies of the discs, Reeves passed them on to Darlington-based band Dan who then included a copy of the disc with their album Kicking Ass at T.J.s.
===Album===
I Will Cure You was Reeves only album. It was released in 1991 by Island Records and peaked at No. 16 in the UK Albums Chart. It featured the Number One single "Dizzy (Tommy Roe song) Dizzy" which was a collaboration with The Wonder Stuff.
It included a mixture of covers and original songs in a variety of musical styles, many of which were originally introduced in Vic Reeves Big Night Out Big Night Out. Along with "Dizzy", two other singles were released from the album, a cover of the Matt Monro song "Born Free (Matt Monro song) Born Free" and a dance reworking of Christian hymn "Abide With Me" which reached No. 6 and No. 47 in the UK Singles Chart respectively.
===Singles===
{{For singles released from I Will Cure You I Will Cure You#Singles}}
In 1995, Reeves and Mortimer released a cover of The Monkees song "Im a Believer" with British band EMF (band) EMF which reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart.
Reeves had a history with the track, having both sung it at the beginning of early Vic Reeves Big Night Out Big Night Out performances in London, and opened the Channel 4 series with it.
In the music video, which was directed by Reeves,
the duo dress as Michael Nesmith Mike Nesmith and Davy Jones (musician) Davy Jones of The Monkees.
On the CD release of the single, a studio version of "At This Stage I Couldnt Say" was included, a track originally sung by characters Mulligan and O’Hare in The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer.
On the 7" release, the bonus track was "At Least We’ve Got Our Guitars", which was the opening song for the last episode of The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer.
In April 2007, the theme to British stop-motion animation Shaun the Sheep, sung by Reeves, was released as a single.
The song reached No. 20 in the UK Singles Chart.
===Contributions===

In 1990 both Reeves and Mortimer contributed backing vocals to Jools Hollands "Holy Cow" (a Lee Dorsey cover). The track was included on Hollands album World of his Own and also released as a single.
Later, Reeves would advertise Hollands album Moving Out to the Country.
Also in 1990, Reeves provided backing vocals for former The Smiths Smiths singer Morrisseys cover of "Thats Entertainment (The Jam song) Thats Entertainment", originally by The Jam.
Reeves vocals were not used in the final edit but he was thanked (as Jim Moir) in the sleeve notes of Morrisseys Sing Your Life single, which featured "Thats Entertainment" as a bonus track.
A fan of the Smiths, Reeves opened some episodes of Vic Reeves Big Night Out Big Night Out with covers of the bands songs including "Sheila Take a Bow" which he intended to include a cover of on his album I Will Cure You. It did not make the final cut.
