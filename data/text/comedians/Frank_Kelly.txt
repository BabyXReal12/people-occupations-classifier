Other work included pantomime and reviews.<ref name="irishtimes">{{cite news title=Late Frank Kelly was loved by generations of Irish people url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/late-frank-kelly-was-loved-by-generations-of-irish-people-1.2552681 accessdate=29 February 2016 work=The Irish Times date=29 February 2016}}</ref>

Kellys first film role was as an uncredited prison officer in The Italian Job (1969), escorting Charlie Croker (Michael Caine) out of prison<ref name="auto"/> in the films opening sequence.

He starred in the popular Raidió Teilifís Éireann RTÉ childrens programme Wanderly Wagon alongside Eugene Lambert and Nora OMahoney from 1968 to 1982, playing a number of different characters and writing many of the scripts.<ref name=journal/> It was Kellys work on Halls Pictorial Weekly (1970–1982) that established him as one of Irelands most recognisable faces. He memorably portrayed councillor Parnell Mooney, a send-up of a backwards local authority figure in rural Ireland. In 1974, Kelly won a Jacobs Award for his work on the series.

In the early 1980s, he was featured in the RTÉ TV programme for those learning Irish Anois is Aris. At the end of the programme he spoke into a telephone, gradually introducing Irish phrases.<ref>{{cite journal  url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED232437&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED232437 title=Learning Irish with "Anois is Aris."

==Father Ted==
Kelly was best known outside Ireland for playing Father Jack Hackett in the comedy series Father Ted, which aired in the United Kingdom from April 1995 to May 1998. Father Jack is an old and offensively rambunctious priest who usually shouts only "feck!", "arse!", "drink!" and "girls!" and the occasional scream of "what!" and "womens knickers".

For his role in Father Ted, he wore contact lenses (to show Father Jacks blank eye). People would not eat lunch with him during filming if he was in his Father Jack make-up<ref name="scripts">{{cite book last1=Linehan first1=Graham last2=Mathews first2=Arthur title=Father Ted: the complete scripts year=1999 page=120 publisher=Boxtree location=London isbn=0752218506}}</ref> because the false flaky skin he was wearing would fall off into the food.

Interviewing Kelly in 1997 for The Irish Times, Deirdre Falvey said of him: "In person he could not be further from Father Jack. Urbane, articulate, thoughtful, fit (he swims and hikes), charming company, full of stories, and quite serious, though his conversation is punctuated by the occasional burst of laughter—he is reputably a great slagger with colleagues, and is very well liked." Kelly himself said:
<blockquote>
I like humour — but Im very suspicious of people who laugh all the time, because they never listen to what youre saying, they always — have another agenda and they generally have no sense of humour. The most untrustworthy body language I know is that of the person who laughs all the time. That terrifies me. People with no sense or a very limited sense of humour I am very wary of too, because its not a sign of great intelligence to be without a sense of humour. If youve no sense of irony you havent a great decision making capacity because you must see the possibilities of the downside of any decision. Without perspective you cant have any wisdom, so it frightens me when I meet captains of industry or whatever who have virtually no sense of humour. Thats the kind of person I find dismaying.<ref name=falvey>{{cite web author=Deirdre Falvey  url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/jack-of-all-trades-1.28072  title=JACK of all trades  publisher=Irishtimes.com  date=1 February 1997  accessdate=1 March 2016}}</ref>

Guess who? Is that you Nuala?" Kelly acted the part of an English BBC reporter interviewing rural inhabitants about local customs, such as watching bacon being sliced, or "ha-hooing" (shouting a Rebel yell) competitions. The village was called Ballykilferret and described by the BBC man as being in "the Republic of Eer-ah" (a mispronunciation of Éire).
