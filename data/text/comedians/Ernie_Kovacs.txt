Ernest Edward "Ernie" Kovacs (January 23, 1919 – January 13, 1962) was an American comedian, actor, and writer.

Kovacss visually experimental and often spontaneous comedic style influenced numerous television comedy programs for years after his death. Many individuals and shows, such as Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Laugh-In Rowan and Martins Laugh-In, Saturday Night Live, Monty Pythons Flying Circus, Jim Henson, Max Headroom (character) Max Headroom,<ref name=Connor>{{Cite news  author=OConnor, John J.  title=TV View: Ernie Kovacs: A comic to the medium born  url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DA173CF93BA35750C0A961948260  work=The New York Times  date=March 8, 1987  accessdate=January 7, 2008  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313085052/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DA173CF93BA35750C0A961948260  archivedate=March 13, 2008  deadurl=yes  df=mdy }}</ref> Chevy Chase,<ref name="Chase">{{cite journal  last=Chase  first=Chevy  title=The Unique Comedy of Ernie Kovacs  work=TV Guide  date=April 9, 1977  pages=39–40}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news  author=OConnor, John J.  title=TV: Why Ernie Kovacss humor grows with time  url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E2D91539F934A25752C1A964948260  work=The New York Times  date=November 17, 1982  accessdate=January 7, 2008  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313085203/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E2D91539F934A25752C1A964948260  archivedate=March 13, 2008  deadurl=yes  df=mdy }}</ref> Conan O’Brien,<ref name=Visconage>{{cite web author=Visconage, Matt title=Conan OBrien and the Legacy of Ernie Kovacs url=http://splitsider.com/2012/01/conan-obrien-and-the-legacy-of-ernie-kovacs work=Splitsider date=January 23, 2012 accessdate=February 5, 2013}}</ref> Jimmy Kimmel, Captain Kangaroo, Sesame Street, The Electric Company, Dave Garroway,<ref name=Willmore>{{cite web author=Willmore, Alison title=Take a Look at the Unappreciated Genius of TV Pioneer Ernie Kovacs url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/television/ernie-kovacs work=Indiewire date=May 2, 2012 accessdate=February 5, 2013}}</ref> Uncle Floyd, and many others<ref>{{cite book title=The Ernie Kovacs Phile last=Walley  first=David G. year=1987 publisher=Simon & Schuster, Inc. location=New York City isbn=978-0-918282-06-4 page=202}}</ref><ref name="Bren">{{cite journal  last=Bren  first=Frank  work=Bright Lights Film Journal  title=Ernie Kovacs: An American Secret  date=31 October 2011  accessdate=19 January 2017  url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/ernie-kovacs-american-secret/#  location=Cathedral City, CA  publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal}}</ref> have credited Kovacs as an influence.

When working at WABC (AM) as a morning-drive radio announcer and doing a mid-morning television series for NBC, Kovacs claimed to dislike eating breakfast alone while his wife, Edie Adams, was sleeping after her Broadway performances. His solution was to hire a taxi driver to come into their apartment with his own key and make breakfast for them both, then take Kovacs to the WABC studios.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.erniekovacs.net/images/radio.jpg title=Mayhem in the A.

==Early life and career==
Kovacss father, Andrew, emigrated from Hungary at age 13. He worked as a policeman, restaurateur, and bootlegger; the last so successfully that he moved his wife Mary, and sons Tom and Ernie, into a 20-room mansion in the better part of Trenton.<ref name="Clowns"/><ref name=NYT>{{Cite news author=Goodman, Mark title=Nothing in moderation url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DE133FF930A25756C0A966958260&scp=4 work=The New York Times date=May 13, 1990 accessdate=December 10, 2008 archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xGMrLUJ4?url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DE133FF930A25756C0A966958260&scp=4 archivedate=March 17, 2011 deadurl=yes df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Though a poor student, Kovacs was influenced by his Trenton Central High School drama teacher, Harold Van Kirk, and received an acting scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1937 with Van Kirks help. The end of Prohibition and the Depression resulted in difficult financial times for the family. When Kovacs began drama school, all he could afford was a fifth floor walk-up apartment on West 74th Street in New York City.<ref name="Serious">{{Cite web url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7rceAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Q2UEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5709,4130335&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en title=Ernie Kovacs:Serious-Minded Clown  date=January 21, 1962 publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune author=Ryan, Jack accessdate=August 6, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Edie">{{cite news url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13846507/ernie_kovacs_what_a_husband/ title=Ernie Kovacs-what a husband! page=113 author=Kovacs, Edie Adams date=July 20, 1958 publisher=Palm Beach Post accessdate=November 7, 2010 via = Newspapers.com}} {{Open access}}</ref>
During this time, he watched many "B movie Grade B" movies; admission was only ten cents. Many of these movies influenced his comedy routines later.<ref name="Clowns"/>

While working in Vermont during 1939, he became so seriously ill with pneumonia and pleurisy that his doctors didnt expect him to survive. During the next year and a half, his comedic talents developed as he entertained both doctors and patients with his antics during stays at several hospitals.<ref>{{Cite web url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oOkKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4k8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6625,2617383&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en title=Ernie Kovacs Doing Fine Living on Borrowed Time date=December 18, 1959 author=Thomas, Bob publisher=Prescott Evening Courier accessdate=July 17, 2010}}</ref> While hospitalized, Kovacs developed a lifelong love of classical music by the gift of a radio, which he kept tuned to WFME (AM)#History WQXR.

He began work as a cigar salesman, which resulted in a lifelong cigar-smoking habit.<ref name="Clowns"/><ref>{{Cite web url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tDMsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zssEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7132,1575081&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en title=Gentle, Quiet Kovacs Killed in Car Crash date=January 14, 1962 publisher=Herald-Journal accessdate=August 6, 2010}}</ref>

Kovacss first paid entertainment work was during 1941, as an announcer for Trentons radio station WTTM. He spent the next nine years with WTTM, becoming the stations director of Special Events; in this job he did things like trying to see what it was like to be run over by a train (leaving the tracks at the last minute) and broadcasting from the cockpit of a plane for which he took flying lessons. Kovacs was also involved with local theater; a local newspaper published a photograph of him and the news that he was doing some directing for the Trenton Players Guild in early 1941.<ref>{{cite web url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_N_-W1PmSNqg/RoMQJPnPYdI/AAAAAAAABmU/qK3L03jhlJY/s1600-h/1941+ERNIE+KOVACS.jpg title=Directs Play date=January 19, 1941 publisher=Tom Glover accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref> The Trentonian, a local weekly newspaper, offered Kovacs a column in June 1945; he named it "Kovacs Unlimited".<ref name="Clowns"/><ref name="Trentonian">{{Cite web  url=http://www.trentonian.com/articles/2010/05/02/news/doc4bde3ede47e68167292280.txt title=Look Whos Talking author=Edelstein, Jeff date=May 2, 2010 publisher=The Trentonian accessdate=July 17, 2010}}</ref>

Arriving at NBCs Philadelphia affiliate, WPTZ, for an audition wearing a barrel and shorts got Kovacs his first television job in January 1950. His first show was Pick Your Ideal, a fashion and promotional program for the Ideal Manufacturing Company. Before long, Kovacs was also the host of  Deadline For Dinner and Now Youre Cooking, shows featuring advice from local chefs.<ref name=Fifties>{{cite web url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,166670-3,00.html title=Philly Fifties: TV author=Corliss, Richard date=July 7, 2001 publisher=Time accessdate=February 9, 2011}}subscription required)</ref>{{efn Now KYW-TV; though the current NBC affiliate is WCAU-TV<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com title=NBC Philadelphia}}</ref>}} When Kovacss guest chef did not arrive in time for the show, he offered a recipe for "Eggs Scavok" (Kovacs spelled backward).<ref name="Pioneers"/><ref name="Ernie"/> Hosting these shows soon resulted in his becoming host of a program named Three to Get Ready, named for WPTZs channel 3 spot on television dials.<ref name="Vision"/><ref name="Pioneers">{{Cite web url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kovacsinphilly.html title=Ernie Kovacs publisher=Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia accessdate=July 17, 2010}}</ref>

Premiering in November 1950, Three to Get Ready was innovative, because it was the first regularly scheduled early morning (7–9am) show in a major television market, predating NBCs Today (U.S. TV program) Today by more than a year. Prior to this, it had been assumed that few people would watch television at such an early hour.<ref>{{cite book url=https://books.google.com/?id=sh8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs&f=false title=WPTZs Kovacs Reaps Early Scanner Harvest publisher=Billboard date=April 7, 1951 accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref> While the show was advertised as early morning news and weather, Kovacs provided this and more in an original manner.

The only character no one ever saw inspired more gifts; he was Howard, the Worlds Strongest Ant. From the time of his WPTZ debut, Howard received more than 30,000 gifts from Kovacss viewers, including a mink lined swimming pool.<ref name="Young"/> Kovacs began his Early Eyeball Fraternal & Marching Society (EEFMS) while doing Three to Get Ready.

During early 1952, Kovacs was also doing a late morning show for WPTZ named Kovacs on the Corner. Kovacs would walk through an imaginary neighborhood, talking with various characters such as Pete the Cop and Luigi the Barber. As with Three to Get Ready, there were some special segments. "Swap Time" was one of them; viewers could bring their unwanted items to the WPTZ studios to trade them live on the air with Kovacs. The show made its debut on January 4, 1952, with Kovacs losing creative control of the program soon after it was begun. Kovacs on the Corner was short-lived; it ended on March 28, 1952, along with Three to Get Ready.<ref name="Pioneers"/><ref name="Ernie"/> Kovacs then began work for WCBS-TV, New York with a local morning show and a later network one. Both programs were canceled; Kovacs lost the local morning program for the same reason as Three to Get Ready – the broadcasting time was confiscated by the stations network in 1954.<ref>{{cite book url=https://books.google.com/?id=lB4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=red+skelton#v=onepage&q=red%20skelton&f=false title=Kovacs Time is Pre-Empted date=January 16, 1954 publisher=Billboard accessdate=May 26, 2011}}</ref>

==Visual humor and characters==

At WPTZ, Kovacs began using the ad-libbed and experimental style that would become his reputation, including video effects, superimpositions, reverse polarities and scanning, and quick blackouts. He was also noted for abstraction and carefully timed Non sequitur (literary device) non-sequitur gags and for allowing the fourth wall to be breached.<ref name="Young">{{cite book title=When Television Was Young: The Inside Story with Memories by Legends of the Small Screen editor-last=McMahon editor-first=Ed editor2-last=Fisher editor2-first=David publisher=Thomas Nelson year=2007 pages=288 isbn=1-4016-0327-0 url=https://books.google.com/?id=2uN_AkdwAioC&pg=PA93&dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs&f=false accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref> Kovacss cameras commonly showed his viewers activity beyond the boundaries of the show set construction set—including crew members and outside the studio itself. Kovacs also liked talking to the off-camera crew and even introduced segments from the studio control room.<ref name="Dumont"/> He frequently made use of accidents and happenstance, incorporating the unexpected into his shows. In one of Kovacss Philadelphia broadcasts, Oscar Liebetrau, an elderly crew member who was known to often sleep for the duration of the telecast, was introduced to the audience as "Sleeping Schwartz." Kovacs was once knocked unconscious when a pie smashed to his face still had the plate under it.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/125079473/?terms=edie%2Bmarilyn%2Bspoof title=Edie to imic Marilyn Again author=Wilson, Earl date=February 5, 1970 page=11A publisher=Florida Today accessdate=January 8, 2017}}(subscription required)</ref>

The sketch called for the magician to frequently hit a gong, which was the signal for a sexy female assistant to bring out a bottle and shot glass for a quick snort of alcohol. Stagehands substituted real liquor for the iced tea normally used for the skit. Kovacs realized that he would be called upon to drink a shot of liquor for each successive gong. He pressed on with the sketch and was quite inebriated by the end of the show.<ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nnYfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MXYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5509,3178344&dq=percy+dovetonsils&hl=en title=Channel Markers date=February 18, 1961 publisher=The Norwalk Hour accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>

Kovacs helped develop camera tricks still common decades after his death. His character Eugene sat at a table to eat his lunch, but as he removed items one at a time from a lunch box, he watched them inexplicably roll down the table into the lap of a man reading a newspaper at the other end. When Kovacs poured milk from a thermos bottle, the stream flowed in a seemingly unusual direction. Never seen on television before, the secret was using a tilted set in front of a camera tilted at the same angle.<ref name=LifeMagazine/>{{sfn Spigel 2009 p=190}}

He constantly sought new techniques and used both primitive and improvised ways of creating visual effects that would later be done electronically. One innovative construction involved attaching a kaleidoscope made from a toilet paper roll to a camera lens with cardboard and tape and setting the resulting abstract images to music.<ref>{{Cite book editor-last=Silverblatt editor-first=Art title=Genre Studies in Mass Media: A Handbook year=2007 page=258 publisher=M.

Removing it from his mouth, Kovacs was able to exhale a puff of white smoke, all while floating underwater. The trick: the "smoke" was a small amount of milk which he filled his mouth with before submerging. Kovacs repeated the effect for a Dutch Masters (cigar) Dutch Masters television commercial on his ABC game show, Take a Good Look (TV series) Take A Good Look.<ref name="Clowns"/>

One of the special effects he employed made it appear as if he was able to look through his assistant, Barbara Lodens, head.  The illusion was performed by placing a black patch on Lodens head and standing her against a black background while one studio camera was trained on her. A second one photographed Kovacs, who used the studio monitor to position himself exactly so that his eye would appear to be looking through a hole in her head.<ref name=LifeMagazine/>

He also developed such routines as an all-gorilla version of Swan Lake, a poker game set to Ludwig van Beethoven Beethovens Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven) Fifth Symphony, the skit Silent Show, in which Eugene interacts with the world accompanied solely by music and sound effects, parodies of typical television commercials and movie genres, and various musical segments with everyday items (such as kitchen appliances or office equipment) moving in sync to music.<ref name="Theory"/><ref name=Horton>{{Cite book title=Ernie Kovacs & Early TV Comedy url=https://books.google.com/?id=zzXtobwmRZAC&pg=PA53&dq=ernie+kovacs+swan+lake#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs%20swan%20lake&f=false editor-last=Horton editor-first=Andrew publisher=University of Texas Press isbn= 9780292779624 accessdate=September 3, 2013 date=March 1, 2010}}</ref> A popular recurring skit was The Nairobi Trio, three derby-hatted apes miming mechanically and rhythmically to the tune of Robert Maxwell (songwriter) Robert Maxwells "Solfeggio".<ref name=genius/>{{sfn Greene 2007 pp=65-66}}

Kovacs reportedly disliked working in front of a live audience, as was the case with the shows he did for NBC during the 1950s. He found the presence of an audience distracting, and those in the seats frequently did not understand some of the more elaborate visual gags and special effects, which could only be appreciated by watching studio monitors instead of the stage.<ref name="Seriously"/>

Like many comedians of the era, Kovacs created a rotation of recurring roles. In addition to the silent "Eugene," his most familiar characters were the fey, lisping poet Percy Dovetonsils, and the heavily accented German radio announcer, Wolfgang von Sauerbraten. Mr. Question Man, who answered viewer queries, was a satire on the long-run (1937–56) radio series, The Answer Man. Others included horror show host Auntie Gruesome, bumbling magician Matzoh Heppelwhite, Frenchman Pierre Ragout, and Miklos Molnar, the sardonic Hungarian host of a cooking show.<ref name="Watching">{{Cite book editor-last=Castleman editor-first=Harry editor2-last=Podrazik editor2-first=Walter year=2004 title=Watching TV: Six Decades of American Television page=416 publisher=Syracuse University Press url=https://books.google.com/?id=A16TTK0vN7sC&pg=PA149&dq=ernie+kovacs#v=onepage&q=ernie%20kovacs&f=false isbn=0-8156-2988-5 accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref> The Miklos character wasnt always confined to a kitchen; Kovacs performed a parody of Howdy Doody The Howdy Doody Show with "Buffalo Miklos" as the host.<ref name=Horton/><ref name="Seriously"/><ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=ernie+kovacs&f=all&c=all&advanced=1&p=4&item=B:22490 title=The Ernie Kovacs Show (NBC) date=August 13, 1956 publisher=Paley Center for Media accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref> Poet Percy Dovetonsils can be found playing Beethovens Moonlight Sonata on a disappearing piano and as a "Master Detective" on the "Private Eye-Private Eye" presentation of the The United States Steel Hour US Steel Hour on CBS March 8, 1961.<ref>{{Cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoTWzZ893go title=Video-YouTube-Percy Dovetonsils-Beethovens Moonlight Sonata accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rM8zAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7fcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1178,633157&dq=ernie+kovacs+private+eye&hl=en title=TV private eye took it on the chin Wednesday night author=Danzig, Fred date=March 9, 1961 publisher=The Bulletin accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref> On the same show, the Nairobi Trio abandons their instruments for a safe cracking job; still with a background of "Solfeggio" but speaking, two of the three appear in an "Outer Space" sketch.<ref name=Horton/><ref>{{Cite web url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=--UQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0uIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6904,1154759&dq=ernie+kovacs+private+eye&hl=en title=Private Eye-Private Eye Stars Kovacs Tonight date=March 8, 1961 publisher=Eugene Register-Guard accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>

Kovacs never hesitated to lampoon those considered institutions of radio and television. In April 1954, he started the late-night talk show, The Ernie Kovacs Show, on DuMont Television Networks New York flagship station, WABD. Stage, screen, and radio notables were often guests. Archie Bleyer, head of Cadence Records, came to chat one evening.  Bleyer had been the long-time orchestra director for Arthur Godfreys radio and television shows.  He had been dismissed by Godfrey the year before along at the same time as fellow cast member, singer Julius La Rosa.  In La Rosas case, he hired a manager, defying an unwritten Godfrey policy. With Bleyer, Godfrey was angered when he found Bleyers record company Cadence Records had produced spoken word material by Don McNeill (radio presenter) Don McNeill, host of American Broadcasting Company ABCs Don McNeills Breakfast Club, which Godfrey considered competition to his show. Bleyer and Kovacs were shown in Split screen (filmmaking) split screen, with Kovacs wearing a red wig, headphones, and playing a ukulele in a Godfrey imitation, while talking with his guest.<ref name="Dumont"/>

Kovacs had a brief stint as a celebrity panelist for the television series Whats My Line?, but took his responsibilities less than seriously, often eschewing a legitimate question for the sake of a laugh. An example: Industrialist Henry J. Kaiser, the founder of an automobile company, was the programs "mystery guest."

==TV specials==

He also did several television specials, including the famous Silent Show (1957), featuring his character, Eugene, the first all-pantomime prime-time network program. After the end of the Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis partnership, NBC offered Lewis the opportunity to host his own 90-minute color television special. Lewis opted to use only 60 minutes, leaving the network 30 minutes to fill; no one wanted this time slot, but Kovacs was willing to have it.<ref>{{cite book title=The Ernie Kovacs Phile last=Walley  first=David G. year=1987 publisher=Simon & Schuster, Inc. location=New York City isbn=978-0-918282-06-4 page=120}}</ref>{{sfn Greene 2007 p=65}}<ref>{{Cite web url=http://users.rcn.com/manaben/Klifemag.html title=Ernies Life Magazine cover  author=Model, Ben publisher=Model, Ben archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208071526/http://users.rcn.com/manaben/Klifemag.html  archivedate = February 8, 2006}}</ref> The program contained no spoken dialogue and contained only sound effects and music.<ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7hRUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pDkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3789,2560910&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en title=TV Key Previews date=January 19, 1957 publisher= St. Joseph News-Press accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref> Featuring Kovacs as the mute, Charlie Chaplin-like character "Eugene", the program contained Surreal humour surreal sight gags.<ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ugUdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=14oEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7113,2850782&dq=ernie+kovacs+eugene&hl=en title=Radio & TV author=Crosby, John date=January 24, 1957 publisher=Sarasota Journal accessdate=November 12, 2010}}</ref> Kovacs developed the Eugene character during the autumn of 1956 when hosting the television series The Tonight Show.{{sfn Greene 2007 p=66}} Expectations were high for the Lewis program, but it was Kovacss special that received the most attention; Kovacs received his first movie offer, had a cover story in Life (magazine) Life magazine, and received the Sylvania Award that year.<ref name="Vision"/><!-- Comment Emmys began during 1949 http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search?person=ernie+kovacs&program=&start_year=1949&end_year=2010&network=All&web_category=All&winner=All -->

The Dutch Masters (cigar) Dutch Masters cigar company became well known during the late 1950s and early 1960s for its sponsorship of various television projects of Ernie Kovacs. The company allowed Kovacs total creative control in the creation of their television commercials for his programs and specials.  He produced a series of non-speaking television commercials for Dutch Masters during the run of his television series Take A Good Look which was praised by both television critics and viewers.{{sfn Spigel 2009 pp=202-203}}{{efn During 1960, the trade journal Advertising Age termed Kovacs "one of the TV commercials best public relations experts right now". Shortly before his death, Kovacs was negotiating with Colgate-Palmolive to produce silent commercials for the companys products. After Kovacss death the trade magazine Printers Ink wrote that Kovacss silent Dutch Masters commercials proved that creativity can be compatible with commercialism and that pioneering with regard to sponsorship can pay.{{sfn Spigel 2009 p=205}}{{sfn Samuel 2001 p=173}}}}

While praised by critics,  Kovacs rarely had a highly rated show.<ref name=Museum/> The Museum of Broadcast Communications says, "It is doubtful that Ernie Kovacs would find a place on television today. He was too zany, too unrestrained, too undisciplined. Perhaps Jack Gould of The New York Times said it best for Ernie Kovacs: The fun was in trying."<ref name="Museum">{{Cite web url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/E/htmlE/ErnieKovaksShow/erkovacshow.htm  title=The Ernie Kovacs Show  publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications  accessdate=September 5, 2010  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204111710/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/E/htmlE/ErnieKovaksShow/erkovacshow.htm  archivedate=December 4, 2010 }}</ref>

Other shows had greater success while using elements of Kovacss style. George Schlatter, producer of the later television series Rowan & Martins Laugh-In, was married to actress Jolene Brand, who had appeared in Kovacss comic troupes over the years and had been a frequent participant in his pioneering sketches. Laugh-In made frequent use of the quick blackout gags and surreal humor that marked many Kovacs projects. Another link was a young NBC staffer, Bill Wendell, Kovacss usual announcer and sometimes a sketch participant. From 1980–1995, Wendell was the announcer for David Letterman, whose show and style of humor were greatly influenced by Kovacs.<ref name="Wendell"/>

Kovacs was also known for his eclectic musical taste.

Kovacs matched an unusual treatment of "Sentimental Journey (song) Sentimental Journey", by Mexican bandleader Juan García Esquivel to video of an empty office in which various items (pencil sharpeners, water coolers, wall clocks) come to life in rhythm with the music; it was a variation on several famous animations of a decade earlier.<ref name="Series"/>{{sfn Greene 2007 p=64}} The original three-minute presentation was outlined by Kovacs in a four-page, single-spaced memo to his staff.

The memo ends with this: "I dont know how the hell youre going to get this done by Sunday – but rots of ruck." (signed) "Ernie (with love)".{{sfn Spigel 2009 p=194}} Kovacs also made careful use of the shrill singer Leona Anderson—who had somewhat less than a classical (or even listenable) voice, by some estimations—in comic vignettes.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.spaceagepop.com/andersonl.htm title=Leona Anderson publisher=Space Age Pop accessdate=August 12, 2010}}</ref>

Kovacs used classical music as background for silent skits or abstract visual routines, including "Concerto for Orchestra", by Béla Bartók; music from the opera "The Love of Three Oranges", by Sergei Prokofiev; the finale of Igor Stravinskys suite "The Firebird"; and Richard Strauss "Till Eulenspiegels lustige Streiche Till Eulenspiegels Merry Pranks". He may have been known best for using Joseph Haydns "String Quartet, Opus 3, Number 5" (the "Serenade," actually composed by Roman Hoffstetter) for a series of 1960–61 commercials he created and videotaped for his sponsor, Dutch Masters (cigar) Dutch Masters.{{sfn Spigel 2009 p=203}}

Kovacs also appeared in roles on other television programs.

Colby was hired by a foreign country to recover their symbol of royalty, a baby elephant, who was being held for ransom.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/466645/I-Was-a-Bloodhound/ title=I Was a Bloodhound publisher=Turner Classic Movies accessdate=October 27, 2011}}</ref>

==Films==
Kovacs found Hollywood success as a character actor, often typecast as a swarthy military officer (almost always a "Captain" of some sort) in such movies as Operation Mad Ball, Wake Me When Its Over (film) Wake Me When Its Over, and Our Man in Havana (film) Our Man in Havana.<ref>{{Cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0468237/ title=Ernie Kovacs publisher=Internet Movie Database accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref> While working in his first movie role for Operation Mad Ball, Kovacs was filming a wild party scene after midnight; it was decided to use real champagne for realism.  After a few hours of work, someone came up to Kovacs and remarked that he had been having quite a good time chasing starlets all night. Kovacs told the stranger to go to hell, since he was following the script; he later learned the stranger was Harry Cohn, head of Columbia Pictures.  Kovacs and Cohn later became friends despite the way they had first met, with Cohn giving Kovacs roles in Bell, Book and Candle (1958) and It Happened to Jane (1959).<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1524203/kovacs_spends_money_quickly/ title=Ernie Kovacs Expert at Spending Cash author=Bacon, James page=27 date=September 4, 1960 publisher=The Oregon Statesman accessdate=January 6, 2015 via = Newspapers.com}} {{Open access}}</ref>

He garnered critical acclaim for movie roles such as the perennially inebriated writer in Bell, Book and Candle and as the cartoonishly evil head of a railroad company (who resembled Orson Welles title character in Citizen Kane) in It Happened to Jane, where he had his head shaved and his remaining hair dyed grey for the role.<ref>{{Cite web url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OK4xAAAAIBAJ&sjid=q-IFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5129,2846809&dq=kovacs+shaves+head&hl=en title=Kovacs Gets A New (Wide) Part date=October 11, 1958 publisher=Ottawa Citizen accessdate=July 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13845012/ernie_kovacs/ page=12 title=Kovacs Enjoys New Anonymity date=August 8, 1958 publisher=Miami News accessdate=July 10, 2010  via = Newspapers.com}} {{Open access}}</ref> In 1960, he played the base commander Charlie Stark in the comedy Wake Me When Its Over (film) Wake Me When Its Over and the con man Frankie Cannon trying to steal John Waynes gold mine in the western comedy, North to Alaska. His own personal favorite was said to have been the offbeat Five Golden Hours (1961), in which he portrayed a larcenous professional mourner who meets his match in a professional widow played by Cyd Charisse. Kovacss last movie, Sail a Crooked Ship (also 1961), was released one month before his death.<ref>{{Cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055394/ title=Sail A Crooked Ship date=December 1961 publisher=Internet Movie Database accessdate=August 6, 2010}}</ref>

==Personal life==

===First marriage===
Kovacs and his first wife, Bette Wilcox, were married on August 13, 1945. When the marriage ended, he fought for custody of their children, Elizabeth ("Bette") and Kip Raleigh ("Kippie"). The court awarded Kovacs full custody upon determining that his former wife was mentally unstable.<ref name="Charges"/> The decision was extremely unusual at the time, setting a legal precedent.

Some of the issues regarding Kovacss tax problems were still unresolved years after his death. Kovacs had purchased two insurance policies in 1951; his mother was named as the primary beneficiary of them. The IRS placed a lien against them both for their cash value in 1961. To stop the actions being taken against her, Mary Kovacs had to go to Federal court. The courts early 1966 ruling resolved the issue, with the last sentence of the document reading: "Prima facie, it looks as if, within the limits of discretion permitted the government by the relevant statutes, an injustice is being done Mary Kovacs."<ref>{{cite web url=http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/355/355.F2d.349.19953_1.html title=Mary KOVACS, Appellant, v.

==Lost and surviving work==
Most of Kovacss early television work was performed live: few kinescopes have survived. Some videotapes of his ABC specials were preserved; others, such as his quirky game show, Take a Good Look, were available mostly in short segments until recently, with the release of some complete, videotaped episodes. <ref name="Clowns"/> After Kovacss death, Adams discovered not only that her husband owed ABC a great deal of money, but that some networks were systematically erasing and reusing tapes of Kovacss shows or disposing the kinescopes and videotapes in New York Bay. She succeeded in purchasing the rights to surviving footage with the proceeds from Kovacss insurance policy and her own earnings after Kovacss IRS debts were paid.<ref name="IRS">{{Cite news url=http://www.post-gazette.com/columnists/19980801roddy.asp title=Edie Hits a High Note author=Roddy, Dennis date=August 1, 1998 publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Special">{{Cite web url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rZkiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=y6oFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2689,7886996&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en title=Edie Adams Arranges Ernie Kovacs Special author=Thomas, Bob date=March 27, 1968 publisher=Sumter Daily Item accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> In March 1996, Adams detailed her experiences before the National Film Preservation Board.<ref name="LoC">{{Cite web  last =Adams  first =Edie  authorlink =Edie Adams  author2 =  title =Television/Video Preservation Study: Los Angeles Public Hearing  work =National Film Preservation Board  publisher =Library of Congress  date =March 6, 1996  url =https://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-film-preservation-board/documents/tvadams.pdf  doi =  accessdate =July 10, 2010}} (PDF)</ref>

The 1984 television movie Ernie Kovacs: Between the Laughter helped return Kovacs to the publics attention, though the show emphasized his bid to retrieve his kidnapped children instead of his professional life. Jeff Goldblum portrayed Kovacs, Madolyn Smith portrayed Bette and Melody Anderson portrayed Adams in the movie.  Edie Adams appeared in a cameo in this movie, playing Mae West; it was one of the impressions she performed in shows with Kovacs.<ref name="Between">{{Cite news url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/15987/Ernie-Kovacs-Between-the-Laughter/overview  title=Movies-Ernie Kovacs: Between the Laughter  year=1984  publisher=New York Times  accessdate=July 11, 2010  first=Stephen  last=Farber  archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xGMgwrPV?url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/15987/Ernie-Kovacs-Between-the-Laughter/overview  archivedate=March 17, 2011  deadurl=yes  df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=beYNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=G24DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7159,3233920&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en title=Edie Adams Has Part in Kovacs Revival date=May 14, 1984 publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette accessdate=July 11, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13844599/ernie_kovacs_vegas_star/ title=Ernie Kovacs Vegas Star date=November 29, 1957 page=17 author=Wilson, Earl publisher=Miami News accessdate=July 11, 2010 via = Newspapers.com}} {{Open access}}</ref> Telecasts of edited compilations of some of his work by Public Broadcasting Service PBS (station WTTW, Chicago) under the title The Best of Ernie Kovacs in 1977, inspired the movie.<ref>{{Cite web url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ObU0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=y2gFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3234,7194044&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en title=Old Ernie Kovacs Films Returning author=Sharbutt, Jay date=June 5, 1976 publisher=Kentucky New Era accessdate=July 17, 2010}}</ref> These broadcasts were made available on VHS and DVD.

During the early 1990s, The Comedy Channel (USA) The Comedy Channel broadcast a series of Kovacss shows under the generic title of The Ernie Kovacs Show. The series included both the ABC specials and some of his 1950s shows from NBC. By 2008, there were no broadcast, cable, or satellite channels broadcasting any of Kovacss television work, other than his panel appearances on Whats My Line? on the Game Show Network. {{citation needed date=September 2014}}

In 1961, Kovacs recorded a record album of poetry in the character of Percy Dovetonsils named Percy Dovetonsils Thpeath, but was unable to release it due to contractual obligations with other record companies. After he was given the masters, Kovacs donated them to a Los Angeles area hospital. Adams was able to re-acquire the tapes in 1967, and they remained part of her private collection until her death in 2008. The tapes were labeled as movie material and were thought to be such until further examination proved they were Kovacs as Percy reading his poems with no music background. The album was finally released in 2012.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/percy-dovetonsilsthpeaks-mw0002371641 title=Percy Dovetonsils Thpeakth author=Kovacs, Ernie publisher=Omnivore year=2012 accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2012/04/5782320/prescient-avant-garde-comedy-ernie-kovacs-and-edie-adams-recovered-c title=The prescient, avant-garde comedy of Ernie Kovacs and Edie Adams, recovered classics of early television author=Matos, Michaelangelo date=April 27, 2012 publisher=Capital New York accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Percy">{{cite web url=http://www.erniekovacs.info/percy_d.html title=Perthy Dovetonthils Thpeakth publisher=erniekovacs.info accessdate=July 12, 2010 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314083420/http://www.erniekovacs.info/percy_d.html archivedate=March 14, 2011 df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kovacsinphilly.html title=Ernie Kovacs-WPTZ year=2005 publisher=Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia accessdate=July 9, 2010}}</ref>
