===Recurring characters on SNL===
* Mark Payne, a waiter who works at Pizzeria Uno. He wears a black do-rag and a black and blue button-down T-shirt featuring Sagara Sanosuke from the anime Rurouni Kenshin and always complains about inconsequential things around the pizzeria (the smell of pepper on the first sketch on the episode hosted by Michael Phelps; how sticky the bar counter is in the second sketch on the episode hosted by Tim McGraw). In the first sketch, Mark had a child that he left on a bus and did not realize it until the end of the sketch. The child was never mentioned in the second sketch.{{episode needed date=October 2013}}
* Anthony Crispino, relays the second-hand news report on Weekend Update, where he always inaccurately reports on current events.{{episode needed date=October 2013}}
* Vinny Vedecci Jr, the son of Bill Haders Italian talk show host, Vinny Vedecci. Wears a black and white childs sailor suit.

Vinny Jr. is based on Johnny Caspar, Jr. (played by Louis Charles Mounicou III) in the Coen brothers Millers Crossing.
* Liam, one of the kids in Gillys (played by Kristen Wiig) elementary school class. It is often implied that he hates his stepfather.{{episode needed date=October 2013}}

Supersoak established that Ass Dan was getting a proper burial), making Ass Dan 30 years old at the time of this death. The 2011 Columbus Day Assblast on the episode hosted by Ben Stiller implied that Ass Dan was still alive, though he almost suffered a heart attack and still died before he could say that he was going to live forever after the heart attack allegedly passed. On the Bruno Mars episode on October 2012, its revealed that Ass Dan has an identical twin brother named Butt Dave (also played by Bobby Moynihan).{{episode needed date=October 2013}}
