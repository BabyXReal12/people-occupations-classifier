==Biography==
Hardings father, Louis Arthur "Curly" Harding, a navigator in the RAF,
was killed in the Second World War, a few weeks before his sons birth.
Harding is of Irish ancestry on his mothers side.
He was educated at St Annes, Crumpsall, and St Bedes College, Manchester. After a varied career as a road digger, dustbin man, schoolteacher, steel erector, bus conductor, boiler scaler and chemical factory worker, he took a degree in English and Education at the Victoria University of Manchester University of Manchester.
Harding began performing as a folk singer and as a member of several local Manchester bands in the 1960s, making his first recordings for the Topic Records Topic label. He began telling jokes between songs, eventually extending them into longer humorous anecdotes which became the main focus of his act. He released his first album, A Lancashire Lad, in 1972, followed by Mrs Ardins Kid in 1974. In 1975, the single release of "The Rochdale Cowboy", reached #22 in the UK Singles Chart, and brought him national attention.
As a stand-up comic he made several series for the BBC and appeared on numerous television and radio programmes, including two series of travel films in Ireland and the Appalachian Mountains of America. He also played rock and roll with his band, the Stylos, with the Lowe Brothers. He has had many albums and singles released, whilst the latter included "Man nited Song".

As well as comedy, he has released albums of serious songs, most notably Bombers Moon, the title track of which tells of his fathers death.
The album also includes "The Accrington Pals" and cover versions of Bruce Springsteens "Factory" and Eric Bogles "And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda".

Harding composed the music scores for Danger Mouse (1981 TV series) DangerMouse, Count Duckula (he also sang the main and end titles with Manchester native Doreen Edwards), The Reluctant Dragon (1987 film) The Reluctant Dragon and The Fool of the World and the Flying Ship for Cosgrove Hall Films.

As well as being an acclaimed musician and comedian, he wrote The Armchair Anarchists Almanac, a humorous A to Z book; two collections of anecdotes, jokes and songs entitled The Unluckiest Man in the World and The 14½ Pound Budgie; and a comedy/thriller/fantasy, Killer Budgies.

His other books include a series covering aspects of his interest in British English folklore folklore and history – The Little Book of the Green Man, The Little Book of Stained Glass, The Little Book of Gargoyles, and The Little Book of Misericords; and the loosely factual autobiography, You Can See the Angels Bum, Miss Worswick! He has also read two of his short stories for Afternoon Story on BBC Radio 4.
In 1986, Harding wrote the foreword to Barry Piltons book, One Man and His Bog.

He more recently made a series of fourteen short films on minority religions in England for the BBCs Heaven and Earth show. Harding has presented the annual BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, and from 1997 to 2012 he presented the weekly BBC Radio 2 flagship folk and roots programme, The Mike Harding Show.
His last show was on 26 December 2012. According to Mark Radcliffe, who took over Radio 2s Folk Show, Harding had left reluctantly, claiming that the BBC had "sold the folk world down the river".
In 2013 Harding launched his own internet radio show, broadcast at 5pm every Sunday and available as a podcast and on iTunes afterwards.
This show went on hiatus in October 2017 after 252 regular episodes, although a special episode #253 was then published in December; further episodes continue to be released more sporadically.

Harding is a dedicated hillwalking hillwalker and a former president, and now life vice president of the Ramblers Association.
He wrote, until a new format was sought for the magazine in 2008, a regular column for hiking magazine The Great Outdoors and campaigned for Right of public access to the wilderness Right to Roam legislation in the United Kingdom.
 
He is one of the patrons of the Wensleydale Railway, a group set up to re-open the once mainly derelict line between Northallerton and Garsdale in Yorkshire, near where he now lives.
He is also the patron of Settle Stories, a charity based in Settle, North Yorkshire, that promotes traditional storytelling and runs the annual Settle Storytelling Festival.
Harding contributed to a promotional leaflet for the Settle tourist board.
