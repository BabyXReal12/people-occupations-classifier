On May 8, 2002, Moore was present when cable network TV Land and the City of Minneapolis dedicated a statue in downtown Minneapolis of the television character she made famous on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. The statue, by artist Gwendolyn Gillen, was chosen from designs submitted by 21 sculptors.<ref name=jsonline>{{cite news first=Sarah  last=Hauer  title=Obituary: Gwen Gillen created Mary Tyler Moore bronze  url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/entertainment/arts/2017/01/31/gwen-gillen-created-mary-tyler-moore-bronze/97253358/  work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  publisher=  date=2017-01-31  accessdate=2017-02-27}}</ref> The bronze sculpture was located in front of the Daytons department store – now Macys – near the corner of 7th Street South and Nicollet Mall. It depicts the iconic moment in the shows opening credits where Moore tosses her Tam o shanter (cap) Tam o Shanter in the air, in a freeze-frame at the end of the montage.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/03-19-2002/0001689536&EDATE=  title="TV Land Honors Mary Tyler Moore", prnewswire.com  publisher=Prnewswire.com  date=March 19, 2002  accessdate=August 14, 2010  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014201843/http://prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F03-19-2002%2F0001689536&EDATE=  archivedate=October 14, 2007  df= }}</ref><ref>[http://www.ci.minneapolis.mn.us/news/news_20020508mtmunveiling "Mary Tyler Moore to Unveil Tam Toss Statue May 8"] City of Minneapolis website</ref> While Daytons is clearly seen in the opening sequence, the store in the background of the hat toss is actually Donaldsons, which was, like Daytons, a locally based department store with a long history at 7th and Nicollet. In late 2015 the statue was placed in storage during renovations to the mall, and in December it was relocated to the citys visitor center, where it will remain until the renovation is complete in 2017, after which the plan is for it to be returned to its original location.<ref name=storage />
