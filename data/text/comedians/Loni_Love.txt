==Life and career==
Love was born in Detroit, Michigan, and grew up in the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects.
Prior to her career as a comedian, she was an electrical engineer,
an experience she talks about in many of her acts.
After graduating from high school in 1989, she had worked for a time on the General Motors assembly line putting doors on 1993 Oldsmobile Cutlasses, work which ignited her interest in electrical engineering. Love then received her bachelors degree in electrical engineering from Prairie View A&amp;M University in Texas. While at Prairie View, she minored in music and was also a member of the Eta Beta Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta.
It was there that she discovered stand-up comedy after winning a $50 competition and then performed frequently during her college life. After finding work as an engineer at Xerox in California, she continued to do stand-up after work in clubs and became a regular at the Laugh Factory.
