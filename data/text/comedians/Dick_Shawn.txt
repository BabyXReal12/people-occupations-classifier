Dick Shawn (born Richard Schulefand, December 1, 1923 – April 17, 1987) was an American actor and comedian.  He played a wide variety of supporting roles and was a prolific character actor.  He was well known during the 1960s for small but iconic roles in madcap comedies, usually portraying caricatures of Counterculture of the 1960s counter culture personalities, such as the deadbeat son Sylvester in Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and the hippie actor "L.S.D."  in The Producers (1968 film) The Producers (1968).

==Early life and career==
Shawn was born in Buffalo, New York, and raised in adjacent Lackawanna, New York Lackawanna. The best remembered roles of his career are the hot-headed Sylvester Marcus, son of Mrs. Marcus (Ethel Merman), in Stanley Kramers Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) and easygoing Lorenzo St. DuBois/Adolf Hitler in the musical Springtime for Hitler, the play within Mel Brookss movie The Producers (1968 film) The Producers (1968). He also provided the Snow Misers voice in The Year Without a Santa Claus (1974).

He had continued success with his stand-up comedy act that he successfully performed for over 35 years in nightclubs around the world. His award-winning one-man stage show, The Second Greatest Entertainer in the Whole Wide World, was sometimes performed with a unique opening. When the audience entered the theater, they saw a bare stage with a pile of bricks in stage center. When the play began, Shawn emerged from the pile of bricks. The startling effect of this required complete concentration and breath control because the slightest movement of the bricks could ruin the surprise appearance.

In addition to roles in more than 30 movies and seven Broadway productions, Shawn made numerous television appearances, toured often, and periodically performed a one-man show that mixed songs, sketches, and pantomime. He was a frequent speaker at the infamous Friars Club Roasts in Friars Club of Beverly Hills Los Angeles and New York Friars Club New York. At one of the X-rated roasts (a 1986 Playboy roast of Tommy Chong) that had overdosed on tasteless routines by previous speakers, Shawn walked up to the microphone, took a long pause, and "vomited" pea soup onto himself and other speakers at the dais.

His many TV appearances included The Ed Sullivan Show, TV movies, sitcoms (including Threes Company on which he played Jack Trippers father), dramas including St. Elsewhere and Magnum, P.I., and a music video for Dance (Ratt song) "Dance" by the hair metal band Ratt (1986). Among his roles in anthology TV series, he starred in an Amazing Stories (TV series) Amazing Stories episode "Miss Stardust", directed by Tobe Hooper, about a bizarre intergalactic beauty pageant,<ref>Amazing Stories: Miss Stardust https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0511106/</ref> and played the Emperor in The Emperors New Clothes in Shelley Duvalls Faerie Tale Theatre. He filled in for vacationing Johnny Carson as guest host on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson on January 1, 1971, which saw the last cigarette commercial on American television (for Virginia Slims) aired on TV, one minute before the cigarette ads were banned.

==Personal life==
Shawn was married to Rita Bachner in 1946, and they had four children: Amy, Wendy (married to John Travoltas older brother Joey Travolta), Adam, and Jennifer. He had one grandchild, Rachel Travolta. He was a longtime resident of Englewood, New Jersey.<ref>Lewis, Dan.

==Death==
On April 17, 1987, during a performance at University of California, San Diegos Mandeville Hall—which included his portrayal of a politician reciting such campaign clichés as "If elected, I will not lay down on the job"—Shawn suffered a fatal Myocardial infarction heart attack and collapsed face-down on the stage.  The audience initially assumed that it was part of his act; but after he had remained motionless on the stage for several minutes, a stage hand examined him and asked if a physician was present.<ref>{{cite news  last1=SCOTT  first1=JANNY  last2=JR  first2=TED THACKREY  title=Comedian Dick Shawn, 63, Is Stricken on Stage, Dies  url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-19/news/mn-1888_1_audience  accessdate=27 June 2018  work=Los Angeles Times  date=19 April 1987}}</ref>

After CPR had been initiated, the audience was asked to leave the auditorium, but most remained, still assuming that it was all part of Shawns act. Many began leaving—still unsure of what they had witnessed—only after paramedics arrived.<ref>{{cite web url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-18/local/me-1079_1_dick-shawn title=Comedian Dick Shawn, 57, Is Stricken on Stage, Dies publisher=Los Angeles Times date=April 18, 1987 accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> A notice in the following days San Diego Union-Tribune San Diego Union newspaper clarified that Shawn had indeed died during the performance.<ref>{{cite web   author=   title=Dick Shawn   url=http://www.answers.com/topic/dick-shawn   work=Actors Biographies   publisher=All Media Guide   year=2009   accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref> Dick Shawn was 63.
