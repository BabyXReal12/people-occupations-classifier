Lots included a night at Sohos Windmill strip club and a course of plastic surgery with the invitation to: "Add spice to your wife."
Shortly after the article appeared the President Club closed "after being denounced in parliament and disavowed by the charities it supported."
Walliams tweeted about his involvement in the event "Last Thursday night I hosted the Presidents Club annual charity fundraiser. I agreed to host as it is one of the biggest charity fund raising events of the year. I was there in a strictly professional capacity and not as a guest."

===Swimming the Thames===
From 5 to 12 September 2011 Walliams swam the length of the River Thames (140 miles) and raised more than £2m for Sport Relief. In the process, he saved a dog from drowning in the river. Once he had got out of the river Walliams said "I think a bath is the only water I will be seeing for a while."
  The swim resulted in him getting giardiasis and injuring a intervertebral disc.
  In late 2013, Walliams had emergency back surgery to alleviate issues caused by the swim.
  ==Personal life==
In 2008, Walliams father, Peter, died of an aggressive form of liver cancer.
  In 2009, Walliams began dating Dutch model Lara Stone.
  On 20 January 2010, they announced their engagement. Walliams proposed to Stone in Los Angeles after her parents had given their blessing to the relationship.
  On 16 May 2010, the couple were married at central Londons Claridges Claridges Hotel.
  In December 2012, the couple announced that Stone was pregnant with their first child and on 6 May 2013, Stone gave birth to their son, Alfred.
  Walliams and Stone lived in the house with recording studio, formerly owned by Noel Gallagher, and known as Supernova Heights in Belsize Park, north London. It was reported on 4 March 2015 that, following five years of marriage, the pair had decided to try a trial separation after "drifting apart".
  On 9 September 2015, Walliams filed for divorce from Stone, citing "unreasonable behaviour". The couple were granted a decree nisi the next day; the marriage was formally dissolved six weeks after the date of filing.
  Walliams hinted at being pansexual in the book Inside Little Britain, but said he did not like to be labelled by that word. In an interview with Radio Times in 2013, he stated: "I think its all about falling in love with the person and that is overlooked, really. I hate it when people confess or reveal their sexuality and also things can change for people over the years. So it is about the person but I also think it goes beyond that. You dont just fall in love with someones body, do you? You fall in love with someones soul and heart and brain."
  Walliams has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder,
  and described his 2006 swim of the English Channel as "some sort of redemption".
