Conway attended Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, where he majored in speech and radio, and was a member of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. When he graduated, he enlisted in the United States Army to fulfill his military obligation.

==Career==

===Cleveland years===
After his discharge from the Army, Conway returned to Cleveland and worked with Ernie Anderson on WKYC KYW-TV, an NBC affiliate, in 1958 and 1959. From 1960 to 1962, he was on WJW (TV) WJW-TV (then a Columbia Broadcasting System CBS affiliate, now a Fox Broadcasting Company Fox affiliate) on a weekday morning film show (under the Ernies Place banner), where he also wrote material for the comedic skits shown in between film intermissions. Conway also recorded a comedy album with Anderson, who himself gained national prominence as a voice over announcer for American Broadcasting Company ABC Television in the 1970s.

WJW dismissed Conway in 1962, in part because he (and Anderson) misled station management into thinking he had experience as a director.<ref>{{YouTube QqCyx1EtVUE}}</ref> Because of this move, which deprived Anderson of his co-host and comic foil, the station asked Anderson if he could host a B-grade (and lower) horror film show on Friday nights instead. Conway continued to make many appearances alongside Andersons alter ego Ghoulardi, in addition to "Big Chuck" Schodowski, a station engineer who Anderson got to assume much of Conways sidekick status (and who ultimately succeeded Anderson as co-host of the horror film program).

After he became famous, Conway resurfaced periodically on Cleveland television on the Hoolihan and Big Chuck and Big Chuck and Lil John shows on WJW-TV, in guest spots and occasional skits. Conway has since made regular guest appearances at numerous "Ghoulardifest" functions held by WJW over the years, along with former Cleveland TV personality Bob Wells (newscaster) Bob "Hoolihan" Wells, in tribute to Anderson, who died in 1997.

===The Steve Allen Show===
Comedic actress Rose Marie visited WJW (TV) WJW in 1961, as part of CBSs promotional practice of sending their major show stars directly to local affiliates: in this case, it was for The Dick Van Dyke Show. She viewed tapes of some of Anderson and Conways skits and proceeded to take Conway under her wing. Following his departure from WJW, Conway moved to New York City; where, with Rose Maries assistance, he auditioned for, and gained a spot on, American Broadcasting Company ABCs The Steve Allen Show as a regular player.<ref name="ap19750706" /> Conway (who by this point had officially changed his first name to Tim) continued on the show through its entire run.

===McHales Navy===

Conway gained a national following from his role as the bumbling, naive Ensign Charles Parker, Executive Officer of the World War II PT-73, in the 1960s sitcom McHales Navy, alongside Ernest Borgnine and Joe Flynn (US actor) Joe Flynn. Borgnine became a mentor and a good friend. Conway appeared at Borgnines 90th birthday celebration and, four years later, paid tribute to his friend at 7th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards on TNT (U.S. TV network) TNT.<ref>[http://www.cleveland.com/tv-blog/index.ssf/2011/01/tim_conway_to_introduce_ernest_borgnine_tribute.html Tim Conway to introduce Ernest Borgnine tribute]. cleveland.com.

Contactmusic.com (2012-07-13). Retrieved on 2012-08-24.</ref>

Afterwards, he starred in a string of short-lived TV series, starting with 1967s Rango (TV series) Rango which starred Conway as an incompetent Texas Ranger Division Texas Ranger.

===Turn-On===
Conway was part of one of the most infamous network TV programming catastrophes ever: Turn-On, a counterculture counter-cultural sketch comedy show on American Broadcasting Company ABC was derided as a ripoff of NBCs Rowan and Martins Laugh-In. Ironically, Turn-On was created and directed by Laugh-Ins creator George Schlatter. Even though Conway was listed only as a guest star on the television pilot pilot, which ABC broadcast on February 5, 1969, it was the List of television series canceled after one episode only episode that ever aired.

Turn-On was so far ahead of its time in terms of comedic treatment of sexuality that the show received enough immediate, negative reaction to force several ABC affiliates, including WEWS in Conways hometown of Cleveland, to refuse to return to the program after the first commercial break. WEWS management also sent an angrily-worded telegram to the networks headquarters. Many West Coast of the United States West Coast affiliates received advance warning and refused to air the show. Conway remarked that the shows premiere party he attended also marked the programs cancellation party,<ref>{{cite video  people= Conway, Tim  title= PIONEERS OF TELEVISION: Tim Conway on "Turn-On" (#104)  url= http://www.iptv.org/video/detail.cfm/1429/pitv_20080111_tim_conway_turn_on  medium= Web  publisher= Public Broadcasting Service  accessdate= 2009-02-23  deadurl= yes  archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090308130751/http://www.iptv.org/video/detail.cfm/1429/pitv_20080111_tim_conway_turn_on  archivedate= 2009-03-08  df=  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news   url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/chi-0611260025nov26,1,1599356.column?ctrack=1&cset=true   title=O.J. blunder hardly a first for television   first=Phil   last=Rosenthal   work=Chicago Tribune   date=26 November 2006   accessdate=2007-04-15   quote=Tim Conway ... has joked the cancellation of the 1969 ABC comedy program came during the casts post-debut party. }}{{dead link date=March 2018  bot=InternetArchiveBot  fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> but ABC did not officially cancel the program for several days.

===The Tim Conway Show (1970)===

In 1970, The Tim Conway Show (1970 TV series) The Tim Conway Show paired Conway with Joe Flynn (US actor) Joe Flynn of McHales Navy in a sitcom as owner-pilots of a one-plane (a Beechcraft Model 18 named Lucky Linda) airline operated by the pair. Having "nowhere to run", this pressurized situation was ideal for the fast repartee of the lead actors. It debuted in January 1970 and the last new show aired in June 1970.<ref name="brooks-marsh-8th">{{cite book  last1= Brooks  first1= Tim  last2= Marsh first2=Earl authorlink1=Tim Brooks (television historian) title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946–Present The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946–Present  edition=8th year=2003 publisher=Ballantine Books location=New York isbn=0-345-45542-8  page=1203}}</ref> In the fall of the same year, Conway was given his own hour-long variety show, The Tim Conway Comedy Hour,<ref name="brooks-marsh-8th"/> or The Tim Conway Comedy House,<ref name="ap19750706">{{cite news   url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sIYsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_cwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7282%2C886685   title=Comedian Tim Conway Will Join The Carol Burnett Show As Regular Member   date=July 6, 1975   newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal   accessdate=June 30, 2013   agency=Associated Press page=C10}}</ref> which, as his other series had, folded quickly, lasting only 13 weeks.<ref name="brooks-marsh-8th"/> Typical of his self-effacing humor, he ordered his cars license plate to reflect the short duration of the series: "13 WKS".<ref name="ap19750706"/> (Conway was given another one-hour variety show ten years later, which revived the title The Tim Conway Show;<ref name="brooks-marsh-8th"/> see later section.)

Beginning in 1975, Conway was often paired with Don Knotts in family films from The Walt Disney Company Disney, including The Apple Dumpling Gang (film) The Apple Dumpling Gang and its 1979 sequel, The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again. They also starred in two independent films, a boxing comedy called The Prize Fighter in 1979, and a 1980 mystery comedy film called The Private Eyes (1980 film) The Private Eyes. In 1983, he starred in another TV show, Ace Crawford, Private Eye, a parody of detective series; it lasted only five episodes.

===The Carol Burnett Show===
Starting with the 1975–76 United States network television schedule 1975–76 season, Conway became a regular on The Carol Burnett Show, after having been a frequent guest for the shows first eight seasons.<ref name="ap19750706" /> Conways work on the show earned him four Emmy Awards. 1 emmy  for writing and 3 emmys for performance, one of which was before he became a regular. Two of Conways memorable characters on the Burnett Show were:
*The Oldest Man (character) The Oldest Man, whose shaggy white hair, slow speech, and shuffling gait ran counter to the much-needed energy levels of the various occupations in which he was usually found. His comic inability to get said jobs done — usually with slapstick results to himself and, with many an ad-lib — both frustrated and broke up his fellow sketch performers.
*Mrs. Wiggins Mr. Tudball, a businessman whose intentions of running a ship-shape office were usually sunk by the bored indifference of his secretary, Mrs. Wiggins (Burnett). Although the character was widely thought to be Swedes Swedish, Conway used a Romanian language Romanian accent learned from his mother.<ref>King, Susan. "[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-tim-conway-20131112-story.html Tim Conways life off script]", Los Angeles Times, November 11, 2013. Accessed September 6, 2016.</ref> For example, his attempts to pronounce his secretarys name came out as "Mrs. Ah-huh-wiggins". He also used this accent for other characters, such as an inept dentist.

Conway could also get results with no dialogue, such as in a sketch in which he played a tired businessman seeking restful sleep in his hotel — and pestered by a housefly, created only by a sound effect and Conways gazing after it. After much struggle, he manages to get the fly out of the room through the window; after returning to bed, he hears a persistent knock on his door, gets up to answer it, and opens the door, letting the fly (who was doing the knocking) back in.

Another skit, also without a word from Conway, featured him playing Simba, a lion raised by humans then released to the wild (based on the lioness Elsa in the film Born Free). Conway, told of the upcoming eviction from the comfortable home, caused Burnett and Harvey Korman to break up with an interminable process of packing to leave.

A prime example of his ability to make his co-stars laugh uncontrollably involved Lyle Waggoner as a captured American airman, with Conway as a stereotypical blond-haired Gestapo agent charged with his interrogation. Stating that "the Fuhrer" had taken particular interest, Conway produces a small Hitler hand puppet. With Conway providing a falsetto voice, the puppet suggests that singing might relax Waggoners character to the point he is willing to talk. In a long, drawn-out fashion, the Hitler puppet sings "Ive Been Working on the Railroad", and with each passing verse, Waggoner loses more of his composure, finally laughing hysterically when puppet-Hitler screeches, "FEE-FI-Fiddely-I-O!"

Conway remained a regular cast member of The Carol Burnett Show until the programs run ended, in 1978.

===The Tim Conway Show (1980–1981)===
In 1980, Conway again was given his own one-hour variety program, titled The Tim Conway Show (1980 TV series) The Tim Conway Show (the title that was previously used for his 1970 sitcom). It aired on CBS, as his previous shows had, and debuted on March 22, 1980.<ref name="brooks-marsh-8th"/> It was originally a full hour but was reduced to half an hour in summer 1980. It lasted longer than any of his earlier self-titled series, ending in August 1981.<ref name="brooks-marsh-8th"/> The format was similar to that of The Carol Burnett Show, with several regular cast members performing in comedy sketches, interspersed with the occasional musical performance by a guest musician. Among the regulars in the cast were Maggie Roswell, Miriam Flynn, Eric Boardman, Jack Riley (actor) Jack Riley, and Dick Orkin. Former Burnett cast member Harvey Korman also became a Tim Conway Show regular in late 1980, after having earlier made guest appearances on the show, as had Carol Burnett and Vicki Lawrence.<ref name="brooks-marsh-8th"/>

In the spring of 1983, Conway starred in another situation comedy, Ace Crawford, Private Eye; a spoof of detective shows, it lasted only a month. In the summer of 1990, he starred in Tim Conways Funny America, playing pranks in disguise on unsuspecting passersby around the United States while hidden cameras recorded the results, which Conway presented to a studio audience; it, too, lasted only a few weeks.

===Dorf===
Conways more recent work includes a series of satirical how-to videos in which he plays a diminutive, dark-haired Scandinavian known as Dorf (a variation on "dwarf"), reprising his goofy Mr. Tudball accent. The Dorf character first appeared on the January 3, 1986 episode of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. In that episode, he was portraying a horse jockey. Dorf also appeared in the 1987 in film 1987 film Dorf on Golf and has since appeared in eight other films on a variety of sports from baseball to auto racing. Dorf on Golf was remastered for DVD in 2007. In 2010, all of the Dorf films were remastered in a DVD Collection featuring all eight films, a behind-the-scenes with Dorf, and a commentary track by Tim Conway on "The Legend of the Paddle: The Oldie Hollis Story". Dorf also appeared on an episode of Tim Conway{{}}s Funny America in the summer of 1990, leading an aerobics class on his impossibly short legs.

In 2009, Conways Dorf character started "helping" Santa Claus on the website iSpotSanta,<ref>[http://www.ispotsanta.com/press.html ‘iSpotSanta’ Website Posts Sightings All December] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217154742/http://www.ispotsanta.com/press.html  date=2010-12-17 }}. Ispotsanta.com. Retrieved on 2012-08-24.</ref> created by comedy filmmaker Pasquale Murena and Anything Goes Productions. Each year, Dorf has three sketches; in 2009, he tried to give Santa his Christmas list, failing and accidentally hitting Santa with a golf ball. Then, in 2010, he tried to give all of the worlds letters to Santa directly using jet rockets to fly to his sleigh, cannonballs, and more.

==Collaborators==

Conway has collaborated with some of the funniest and most talented people in Hollywood and has kept long-time collaborations with many of them.

===Harvey Korman===

Conway first met Harvey Korman in 1966 while a guest, the first of three, on The Danny Kaye Show. Korman was a four-year series regular on Kayes CBS variety hour. 1967 saw the end of the Kaye show and the debut of The Carol Burnett Show. With Korman available, he stepped into a regular role there. Conway appeared as a guest during that first Burnett season and the two men immediately became friends starting a lifetime of working together until Kormans death in 2008. One of their most famous sketches was from The Carol Burnett Show called "The Dentist Sketch."  In this sketch, Korman goes to the just-graduated dentist Conway for a toothache. Conway proceeds to remove Kormans tooth, but before he can inject the novocaine into Korman, he injects it into himself, causing his head, hand, and leg to go numb.

Korman and Conway performed together for 10 years on The Carol Burnett Show before Korman left to pursue his own show. Korman joined Conway on Conways shows and then later on in the 1986 film The Longshot, which Conway wrote for the two men. Conway also wrote the direct-to-video films Tim and Harvey in The Great Outdoors and Together Again with Tim and Harvey, which the comedy pair starred in together. The DVD Together Again with Tim and Harvey was a recording of their touring stage show that ran over 10 years to sold out markets until Kormans death in 2008. Conway has referred to Korman as, "The smartest man I knew but couldnt tie his shoelaces".

===Don Knotts===

When Conway was starting his career in Hollywood, so was Don Knotts. Both men were regulars on The Steve Allen Show, though at different times. They didnt have the chance to work together until Disney Studios paired the two men on the Apple Dumpling Gang series of films, and their comedy clicked; Knottss boisterous, Barney Fife-style bungling both contrasted and meshed with Conways quieter form of physical comedy. The first film starred Bill Bixby and Susan Clark in 1975 and was called The Apple Dumpling Gang (film) The Apple Dumpling Gang. The film centered around Bixby being tricked into taking care of a trio of orphans as the pair of lovable holdup men named Amos Tucker (Conway) and Theodore Ogelvie (Knotts) attempt to steal the gold nugget the children find. The film was a commercial success, and a sequel was made starring the pair in 1979 called The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again. The sequel did not have the other cast members but was hugely profitable for Disney.<ref>http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=appledumplinggangridesagain.htm</ref>

Conway wrote two other films for the pair to star in together starting with The Prize Fighter in 1979 and The Private Eyes (1980 film) The Private Eyes in 1980. Both were independently produced and the highest grossing independent films of those years. They had a cameo in the Cannonball Run II film together and in later years voiced characters Hermie and Wormie in numerous childrens shows from Max Lucado.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348839/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_14</ref>

===Pasquale Murena===

In 2007, Conway met filmmaker Pasquale Murena when Murena was brought in to direct additional scenes and edit the direct-to-DVD film Legend of the Paddle, starring Conway.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1773539/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt</ref> The two men subsequently worked together on numerous productions, including Murena producing the DVD releases of Together Again with Tim and Harvey, the re-releases of Tim and Harvey in The Great Outdoors, Dorf on Golf, and Dorf Goes Fishing. Murena directed, produced and co-wrote with Conway six Dorf comedy sketches for the DVD release of The Ultimate Dorf DVD Collection, which has sold over 3 million copies.<ref>http://sowrongbutfunny.com/my-new-dvd-release-of-tim-conway-in-the-ultimate-dorf-dvd-collection/</ref>

Starting in 2009, the two men collaborated on their first sketches for the website iSpotSanta, where Dorf helps Santa deliver presents, and works at the North Pole as Santas #1 elf. They have done over 25 comedy sketches and three short films for the website, while garnering over 35 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://ispotsanta.com/dorf.html  title=Archived copy  accessdate=2015-08-12  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429112547/http://www.ispotsanta.com/dorf.html  archivedate=2015-04-29  df= }}</ref> Conway was quoted in an interview on the Disney Channel, stating that, "Pasquale has done more with Dorf then I ever imagined. We love making these films for kids." Continuing their success, Murena cast Conway as Professor VanVanGuard in his award-winning first feature film in 2014 called, Chip & Bernies Zomance, with Conway adding his unique humor to this zombie film.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3599652/</ref>

===Ernie Anderson===
Conway first pitched the idea of Ernie Anderson and his doing a late night show together in Cleveland during the 1960s and that is where Rose Marie found Conway and got him a role on The Steve Allen Show. Before that, the duo recorded two comedy albums together: Are We On? (1966) and Bull (1967).
