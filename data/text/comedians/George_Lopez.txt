In 2000, after several years of performing stand-up comedy, Lopez was approached by actress Sandra Bullock for Lopez to produce and star in a comedy. Bullock was concerned about the lack of Hispanic-oriented sitcoms on American television and pushed to get a sitcom on television that starred Hispanics without being exclusively about the Hispanic American community. Long criticized by Hispanic American groups for lack of Latinos on their television shows, American Broadcasting Company ABC quickly picked up the television series. In 2002, Lopez became one of the few Latinos to star in a television comedy series, following in the footsteps of Desi Arnaz, Freddie Prinze, and John Leguizamo. George Lopez (TV series) George Lopez is an American situation comedy that originally aired on ABC from 2002 to 2007. Lopez is the co-creator, writer, producer, and star of the show.

On March 8, 2007, it was announced that George Lopez would join the Nick at Nite lineup. It first aired on Nick at Nite on September 10, 2007. On May 15, 2007, ABC announced that the series would be canceled after its sixth season. The show last aired on ABC September 7, 2007. The show also entered television syndication syndication in the fall of 2007. Never a big Nielsen ratings Nielsen hit in prime-time, the show became a surprise success in syndication.

After receiving the news that his show was canceled in 2007, Lopez criticized president of ABC Entertainment Steve McPherson for using racially motivated reasons for his decision. The actor told the Los Angeles Times that "TV just became really, really white again," and lashed out against ABC by saying, "So a chicano cant be on TV, but a caveman can?" in reference to the short-lived sitcom Cavemen (TV series) Cavemen, which was replacing George Lopez on the schedule. Cavemen garnered a sharply negative reception from critics and viewers, and was canceled after 13 episodes. Lopez blamed ABC for causing over a hundred of his shows staff to become jobless.<ref>{{cite news  url = http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/15/entertainment/et-lopez15  last = Fernandez  first = Marie  title = George Lopez lashes out at ABC work=Los Angeles Times  date = May 15, 2007  accessdate =March 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news  url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2007/05/post_1.html  last = Fernandez  first = Marie  title = TV just got a lot whiter, says a canceled George Lopez work=Los Angeles Times  date = May 14, 2007  accessdate =June 3, 2008}}</ref>
