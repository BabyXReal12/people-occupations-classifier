Rodney Dangerfield (born Jacob Rodney Cohen<ref name="Dangerfield sweat" /> November 22, 1921 – October 5, 2004) was an American stand-up comedian,<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-rodney-dangerfield.html title=Letter of Recommendation: Rodney Dangerfield author=Halberstadt, Alex date=January 26, 2018 publisher=The New York Times accessdate=August 2, 2018}}</ref> actor, voice artist, filmmaker, musician<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/05/dave-holmes-no-respect-rappin-rodney-1984-chart.html title=Respect to ‘Rappin’ Rodney’ and 99 Other Hits From 1984 author=Holmes, Dave date=May 29, 2014 publisher=Vulture accessdate=August 2, 2018}}</ref> and author known for his self-deprecating one-line joke one-liners humor, his catchphrase "I dont get no respect!" and his monologues on that theme.  

He began his career working as a stand-up comic in the Borscht Belt resorts of the Catskill Mountains north of New York City.  His act grew in notoriety as he became a mainstay on late-night talk shows throughout the 1960s and 1970s, eventually developing into a headlining act on the Las Vegas casino circuit.  A few bit-parts in films such as The Projectionist appeared throughout the 1970s, but his breakout film role came in 1980 as a boorish nouveau riche golfer in the ensemble comedy Caddyshack, which was followed by two more successful films: 1983s Easy Money (1983 film) Easy Money and 1986s Back to School.  Additional film work kept him busy through the rest of his life, mostly in comedies, but with a rare dramatic role in 1994s Natural Born Killers as an abusive father.  Health troubles curtailed his output through the early 2000s before his death, in 2004, after a month in a coma due to complications from brain surgery.

After Cohens father abandoned the family, his mother moved him and his sister to Kew Gardens, Queens, and he attended Richmond Hill High School (Queens, New York) Richmond Hill High School, where he graduated in 1939. To support himself and his family, he sold newspapers and ice cream at the beach, and delivered groceries.<ref name=DeseretNews/>

At the age of 15, he began to write for stand-up comedians while performing at a resort in Ellenville, New York.<ref name= silent>{{cite news  title= That Laughter You Hear Is the Silent Majority  first= Albert  last= Goldman  work= The New York Times  date= June 14, 1970  page= 111  url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/118849740/}}</ref> Then, at the age of 19 he legally changed his name to Jack Roy.<ref>{{cite web url=http://movieactors.com/actors/rodneydangerfield.htm  title=Rodney Dangerfield publisher=Movieactors.com  date=  accessdate=July 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news  title= A "Born Loser" Who Gets Laughs  work= The Baltimore Sun  date= July 13, 1969  page= TW6  url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/539155980/ }}</ref> He struggled financially for nine years, at one point performing as a singing waiter until he was fired. He also performed as an acrobatic diver before taking a job selling aluminum siding to support his wife and family. He later said that he was so little known when he gave up show business that, "at the time I quit, I was the only one who knew I quit!"

==Career==

===Early career===

In the early 1960s he started down what would be a long road toward rehabilitating his career as an entertainer, still working as a salesman by day. He divorced his first wife Joyce in 1961, and returned to the stage, performing at many hotels in the Catskill Mountains, but still finding minimal success. He fell into debt (about $20,000 by his own estimate), and couldnt get booked. As he would later joke, "I played one club&mdash;it was so far out, my act was reviewed in Field & Stream."<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/WolfFiles/story?id=96052&page=1 "Rodney Dangerfield Remarries . . . And This Time Hes Sober."] ABC News. August 24, 2000.</ref>

He came to realize that what he lacked was an "image", a well-defined on-stage persona that audiences could relate to, one that would distinguish him from other comics. After being shunned by some premier comedy venues, he returned to the East Coast{{what? date=August 2018}} where he began developing a character for whom nothing goes right.

He took the name Rodney Dangerfield, which had been used as the comical name of a faux cowboy star by Jack Benny on his radio program at least as early as the December 21, 1941, broadcast, and later as a pseudonym by Ricky Nelson on the TV program The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. The Benny character, who also received little or no respect from the outside world, served as a great inspiration to Dangerfield while he was developing his own comedy character. The "Biography" program also tells of the time Benny visited Dangerfield backstage after one of his performances. During this visit Benny complimented him on developing such a wonderful comedy character and style. However, Jack Roy remained Dangerfields legal name,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.kapelovitz.com/dangerfield.htm title=Clear and Present Dangerfield author=Kapelovitz, Dan publisher=Hustler date=October 2004 accessdate=May 21, 2007}}</ref> as he mentioned in several interviews. During a question-and-answer session with the audience on the album No Respect, Dangerfield joked that his real name was Percival Sweetwater.

On Sunday, March 5, 1967, The Ed Sullivan Show needed a last-minute replacement for another act,<ref name="Edsullivan.com">{{cite web url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/rodney-dangerfield/  title=Rodney Dangerfield &#124; Ed Sullivan Show  publisher=Edsullivan.com  date=March 5, 1967  accessdate=March 31, 2012}}</ref> and Dangerfield became the surprise hit of the show.

Dangerfield began headlining shows in Las Vegas and continued making frequent appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040053/fullcredits#cast:imdb cast list for Ed Sullivan Show]</ref> He also became a regular on The Dean Martin Show and appeared on The Tonight Show a total of 35&nbsp;times.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055708/fullcredits#cast:imdb episode guide for Tonight Show]</ref> 
One of his quips as a standup comedian was, “I walked into a bar the other day and ordered a drink. The bartender says, ‘I can’t serve you.’ I said, ‘Why not? Im over 21!’ He said, ‘You’re just too ugly.’ I said as always, ‘Boy I tell you, I get no respect around here’.” The “no respect” phrase would come to define his act in the years that followed.

In 1969, Rodney Dangerfield teamed up with longtime friend Anthony Bevacqua to build the Dangerfields comedy club in New York City, a venue he could now perform in on a regular basis without having to constantly travel. The club became a huge success, and has been in continuous operation for nearly 50 years.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6187136/ title=Rodney Dangerfield dead at 82 agency=Associated Press publisher=MSNBC.com date=October 7, 2004 accessdate=September 14, 2006}}</ref> Dangerfield’s was the venue for several HBO shows which helped popularize many stand-up comics, including Jerry Seinfeld, Jim Carrey, Tim Allen, Roseanne Barr, Robert Townsend (actor) Robert Townsend, Jeff Foxworthy, Sam Kinison, Bill Hicks, Rita Rudner, Andrew Dice Clay, Louie Anderson, Dom Irrera, and Bob Saget.{{Citation needed date=April 2009}}

Grammy.com]</ref> One of his TV specials featured a musical number, “Rappin’ Rodney”, which would appear on his 1983 follow-up album, Rappin Rodney (album) Rappin Rodney. In December 1983, the “Rappin’ Rodney” single became one of the first Hot 100 rap records, and the associated video was an early MTV hit.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.fourthgradenothing.com/2011/08/rappin-rodney-dangerfield-no-respect-in_10.html  title=Rappin Rodney Dangerfield - No Respect in 1983  publisher=Fourth Grade Nothing  date=August 10, 2011  accessdate=March 31, 2012}}</ref> The video featured cameo appearances by Don Novello as a last rites priest munching on Rodneys last meal of fast food in a styrofoam container and Pat Benatar as a masked executioner pulling a hangmans knot. The two appear in a dream sequence where Dangerfield is condemned to die and does not get any respect, even in Heaven, as the gates close without his being permitted to enter.

===Career peak===
Though his acting career had begun much earlier in obscure movies like The Projectionist (1971),<ref name= silent/> Dangerfields career peaked during the early 1980s, when he began acting in hit comedy movies.

One of Dangerfields more memorable performances was in the 1980 golf comedy Caddyshack, in which he played an obnoxious nouveau riche property developer who was a guest at a golf club, where he clashed with the uptight Judge Elihu Smails (played by Ted Knight). His role was initially smaller, but because he and fellow cast members Chevy Chase and Bill Murray proved adept at improvisation, their roles were greatly expanded during filming (much to the chagrin of some of their castmates).<ref>[http://www.biography.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=510360&airingid=511286 Caddyshack: The Inside Story] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610130346/http://www.biography.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=510360&airingid=511286  date=2011-06-10 }}, Bio.HD December 13, 2009.</ref> His appearance in Caddyshack led to starring roles in Easy Money (1983 film) Easy Money and Back To School. Unlike his stand-up persona, his comedy film characters were portrayed as successful and generally popular—if still loud, brash and detested by the wealthy elite.

Throughout the 1980s, Dangerfield also appeared in a series of commercials for Miller Lite beer, including one in which various celebrities who had appeared in the ads were holding a bowling match. With the score tied, after a bearded Ben Davidson told Rodney, "All we need is one pin, Rodney", Dangerfields ball went down the lane and bounced perpendicularly off the head pin, landing in the gutter without knocking down any of the pins.

In a change of pace from the comedy persona that made him famous, he played an child abuse abusive father in Natural Born Killers in a scene for which he wrote or rewrote all of his own lines.<ref>De Vries, Hilary.

Times. August 21, 1994.</ref>

Dangerfield was rejected for membership in the Motion Picture Academy in 1995 by the head of the Academys Actors Section, Roddy McDowall.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/06/1096949552940.html?from=storyrhs   work=The Sydney Morning Herald   title=Dangerfield dies   date=October 6, 2004}}</ref> After fan protests, the Academy reconsidered, but Dangerfield then refused to accept membership.

Dangerfield appeared in an episode of The Simpsons titled "Burns, Baby Burns", in which he played a character who is essentially a parody of his own persona, Montgomery Burns Mr. Burnss son Larry Burns (The Simpsons) Larry Burns. He also appeared as himself in an episode of Home Improvement (TV series) Home Improvement.

Dangerfield also appeared in the 2000 Adam Sandler film Little Nicky, playing Lucifer, the father of Satan (Harvey Keitel) and grandfather of Nicky (Sandler).

He was recognized by the Smithsonian Institution, which put one of his trademark white shirts and red ties on display. When he handed the shirt to the museums curator, Rodney joked, "I have a feeling youre going to use this to clean Charles Lindbergh Lindberghs plane."<ref>{{cite web url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19820429&id=kLRPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LwYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6577,8156255  title=AP news report in the &#39;Ocala Star-Banner,&#39; April 29, 1982  publisher=News.google.com  date=  accessdate=July 24, 2013}}</ref>

Dangerfield played an important role in comedian Jim Carreys rise to stardom. In the 1980s, after watching Carrey perform at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, Rodney signed Carrey to open for Dangerfields Las Vegas show. The two would tour together for about two more years.<ref>Jim Carreys foreword in Its Not Easy Bein Me: A Lifetime of No Respect But Plenty of Sex and Drugs by Rodney Dangerfield.

==Personal life==
Dangerfield was married twice to Joyce Indig. Together, the couple had two children: son Brian Roy (born 1949) and daughter Melanie Roy-Friedman.  From 1993 until his death, he was married to Joan Child.<ref>{{cite news last1=Pearlman first1=Jeff title=The Tears of a Clown url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10466-2004Jul23.html accessdate=May 14, 2016 newspaper=The Washington Post date=July 24, 2004}}</ref>

In 1980, Rodney shared an apartment on Manhattans Upper East Side with a housekeeper, his poodle, Keno, and his closest friend of 30 years, Joe Ancis.<ref>{{cite web last=Durkee first=Culter title=Rodney Dangerfield Has Known Worse—Its Usually An Albatross date=October 6, 1980 publisher=People (magazine) url=http://people.com/archive/rodney-dangerfield-has-known-worse-its-usually-an-albatross-vol-14-no-14 accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref> Joe was also friend of and major influence on Lenny Bruce, and was a surrealistically fast and funny man who could never perform in front of strangers.<ref>{{cite web last=Fong-Torres first=Ben title=Rodney Dangerfield: He Whines That We May Laugh date=September 18, 1980 publisher=Rolling Stone url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/rodney-dangerfield-he-whines-that-we-may-laugh-19800918 accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref>

Dangerfield resented being confused with his on-stage persona. Although his wife Joan described him as "classy, gentlemanly, sensitive and intelligent,"<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/6054693/rodneydangerfield?pageid=rs.Artistcage&pageregion=triple3&rnd=1096316510181&has-player=true title=Gone to Pot author=Hedegaard, Erik publisher=Rolling Stone date=May 19, 2004 accessdate=May 21, 2007}}</ref> he was often treated like the loser he played. In his 2004 autobiography, Its Not Easy Bein Me: A Lifetime of No Respect but Plenty of Sex and Drugs ({{ISBN 0-06-621107-7}}), which was released posthumously, he discussed being a longtime cannabis (drug) marijuana smoker.

Dangerfield, while Jewish, referred to himself as an atheist during an interview with Howard Stern on May 25, 2004. Dangerfield added that he was a "logical" atheist.<ref>https://ffrf.org/news/day/dayitems/item/14909-rodney-dangerfield- Dangerfield said he was an atheist during an interview with Howard Stern in May 2004.

In his memory, Saturday Night Live ran a short sketch of Dangerfield (played by Darrell Hammond) at the gates of heaven. Saint Peter mentions that he heard Dangerfield got no respect in life, which prompts Dangerfield to spew an entire string of his famous one-liners. After he’s done, he asks why Saint Peter was so interested. Saint Peter replies, “I just wanted to hear those jokes one more time” and waves him into heaven, prompting Dangerfield to joyfully declare: “Finally! A little respect!”<ref>http://snltranscripts.jt.org/04/04bdangerfield.phtml</ref>

On September 10, 2006, Comedy Central’s Legends: Rodney Dangerfield commemorated his life and legacy. Featured comedians included Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Jay Leno, Ray Romano, Roseanne Barr, Jerry Seinfeld, Bob Saget, Jerry Stiller, Kevin Kline and Jeff Foxworthy.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0865327/ reference to Legends: Rodney Dangerfield]</ref>

On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, May 29, 2009, Leno credited Dangerfield with popularizing the style of joke he had long been using. The format of the joke is that the comedian tells a sidekick how bad something is, and the sidekick&mdash;in this case, guitar player Kevin Eubanks&mdash;sets up the joke by asking just how bad that something is.<ref>“The Tonight Show with Jay Leno”, New York: National Broadcasting Company, May 29, 2009.</ref>

In March 2017, Dangerfield’s widow expressed disappointment with a mural that had been painted of Dangerfield in Kew Gardens, his old Queens neighborhood, about a year earlier.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170303123641/http://abcnews.go.com/Weird/wireStory/widow-mural-rodney-dangerfield-flattering-45839505 Widow: Mural of Rodney Dangerfield is ‘less-than-flattering’] </ref>
