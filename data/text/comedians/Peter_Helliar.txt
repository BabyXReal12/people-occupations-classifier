==Alter ego==
{{Main Bryan Strauchan}}
File:Straunie.jpg thumb 160px right Helliar in character as Bryan Strauchan
For the 2005 Australian Football League AFL season, Helliar created an alter ego named Bryan Strauchan (aka "Strauchanie") who debuted on the television show Before the Game. The character was the last pick in the 2004 AFL national draft, and yet to get a game for his new club Collingwood Football Club Collingwood.

For the role, Helliar dons a blonde mullet (hairstyle) mullet wig and attempts to play up an Australian bogan stereotype. The comedy is achieved by self-effacing humour, putting Strauchan in situations that highlight his weight, lack of fitness and general inability while his egotistical personality and delusions of grandeur mean he is completely unaware of these weaknesses. The character of Strauchanie has made several subsequent appearances across different media.{{Original research inline date=August 2009}}

In the 2009 EJ Whitten Legends football match, Helliar broke his ankle late in the game after being tackled. He suggested that this could be the end of his career. {{quote You could be seeing the end of a great career. Doctors say I wont walk again unless theres two blokes on either side of me. I will always stay involved in football; maybe even coach Peter Helliar in the role of Bryan Strauchan}}
