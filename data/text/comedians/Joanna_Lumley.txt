===Gurkha Justice Campaign===

{{Main article Gurkha Justice Campaign}}
In 2008, Lumley became the public face of a campaign to provide all Nepalese people Nepalese origin Gurkha veterans who served in the British Army before 1997 the right to settle in Britain. Those serving after 1997 had already been granted permission, but the UK Government has not extended the offer to all of the Gurkhas, who are natives of Nepal. On 20 November 2008, Lumley led a large all-party group including Gurkhas starting from Parliament Square to 10 Downing Street with a petition signed by 250,000 people. She supports the Gurkha Justice Campaign.
On 24 April 2009, she stated that she was "ashamed" of the UK administrations decision to affix five criteria to the Gurkhas right to settle in the UK. With the support of both Opposition parties and Labour rebel MPs on 29 April 2009, a Liberal Democrat motion that all Gurkhas be offered an equal right of residence was passed, allowing Gurkhas who served before 1997 residence in the UK and access to housing, social security and healthcare.
Following the Government defeat, the Minister of State for Borders and Immigration Minister for Immigration Phil Woolas announced that a further review would be completed by the middle of July.

On 5 May 2009, Lumley said that she had received private assurances of support from "a senior member of the British Royal Family Royal Family",
and attended a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown at 10 Downing Street the following day. Afterwards, she described the meeting as "extremely positive", and praised Mr Brown, saying, "I trust him. I rely on him. And I know that he has now taken this matter into his own hands and so today is a very good day."
However, on the day following the meeting with Brown, five Gurkha veterans who had applied for residency in the United Kingdom received letters telling them that their appeals had been rejected – many saw this as a betrayal, despite the fact that for the letters to have been received the day after the meeting they might have been sent before it (and certainly after the 29 April Commons vote). Lumley confronted Phil Woolas at the BBC Westminster studios about the issue and, after pursuing him around the studio, the pair held an impromptu press conference in which Woolas agreed to accept Gurkha Justice Campaign input in developing new guidelines by July while giving sympathetic treatment to Gurkhas not meeting the then current immigration guidelines before the development of new guidelines.
Following a Home Affairs Select Committee Commons Home Affairs Committee meeting in which talks were held between campaigners, the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) Ministry of Defence and the Home Office on 19 May, Gordon Brown announced to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom House of Commons on 20 May that the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith would make a statement on the issue the following day.
Ms Smith subsequently announced that all Gurkha veterans who had served four years or more in the British Army before 1997 would be allowed to settle in Britain.
As a result of her campaigning skills, there were calls for Joanna Lumley to stand as a Member of Parliament (UK) Member of Parliament at the United Kingdom general election, 2010 forthcoming general election. However, she has dismissed the suggestion.
During an appearance on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on 29 May, she reiterated that she had no desire to run for election to the House of Commons.

In July 2009, Lumley went on a visit to Nepal. Upon her arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport, she was greeted by crowds of Gurkha supporters. Lumley said in a statement, "I feel so humbled by the fact Im going to meet so many ex-Gurkhas and their families, and see where they are and how they live."
While there, Lumley was hailed Daughter of Nepal by the crowds of fans at the airport.
===Work for Survival International===
{{Main article Survival International}}
Lumley has long been a supporter of Survival International and the cause of indigenous rights, and narrated Survivals documentary, Mine: story of a sacred mountain.
The film tells the story of the remote Kondha Dongria Kondha tribe in India and their battle to stop a vast bauxite mine from destroying their land and way of life. In defence of the Dongria, she has said,
<blockquote>
 "It greatly disturbs me that a British company will be responsible for the destruction of these wonderful people. I urge the public to support the Dongria, who simply want to be allowed to live in peace. Unlike so many of Indias rural poor, the Dongria actually live very well in the Niyamgiri hills, and its a terrible irony that what Vedanta Resources Vedanta is proposing to do in the name of development will actually destroy this completely self-sufficient people."
</blockquote>
Lumley also contributed her writing for the book We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples, released in October 2009 with profits going in support of Survival.
A collection of photographs, statements from tribal people and essays from international authors, the book explores the richness of the cultures of indigenous peoples around the world and the risks to their existence. In her essay for the book, Lumley speaks of the Dongria way of life and the threats they face in the name of corporate interests, and calls for action to stop such decisions.

since 1993. Tree Aid is a charity which enables communities in Africas drylands to fight poverty and become self-reliant, while improving the environment.

===Patron of PENHA===

Lumleys commitment to support the pastoral communities of the Horn of Africa is of paramount importance to PENHA.
