On 24 April 2009, she stated that she was "ashamed" of the UK administrations decision to affix five criteria to the Gurkhas right to settle in the UK. With the support of both Opposition parties and Labour rebel MPs on 29 April 2009, a Liberal Democrat motion that all Gurkhas be offered an equal right of residence was passed, allowing Gurkhas who served before 1997 residence in the UK and access to housing, social security and healthcare.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8014265.stm   publisher=BBC News   title=Fury over Gurkha settlement plan   date=24 April 2009   accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8019745.stm   publisher=BBC News   title=Lib Dems challenge Gurkha ruling   date=26 April 2009   accessdate=27 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8023882.stm title=BBC Brown defeated over Gurkha rules accessdate=29 April 2009   date=29 April 2009   publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Following the Government defeat, the Minister of State for Borders and Immigration Minister for Immigration Phil Woolas announced that a further review would be completed by the middle of July.

On 5 May 2009, Lumley said that she had received private assurances of support from "a senior member of the British Royal Family Royal Family",<ref>{{cite news url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8034131.stm title= No 10 denies Lumley Gurkha snub publisher= BBC News date= 5 May 2009 accessdate=23 May 2009}}</ref> and attended a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown at 10 Downing Street the following day. Afterwards, she described the meeting as "extremely positive", and praised Mr Brown, saying, "I trust him. I rely on him. And I know that he has now taken this matter into his own hands and so today is a very good day."<ref>{{cite news url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8036036.stm title= Lumley trusts Brown on Gurkhas publisher= BBC News date= 6 May 2009 accessdate=23 May 2009}}</ref>

However, on the day following the meeting with Brown, five Gurkha veterans who had applied for residency in the United Kingdom received letters telling them that their appeals had been rejected – many saw this as a betrayal, despite the fact that for the letters to have been received the day after the meeting they might have been sent before it (and certainly after the 29 April Commons vote). Lumley confronted Phil Woolas at the BBC Westminster studios about the issue and, after pursuing him around the studio, the pair held an impromptu press conference in which Woolas agreed to accept Gurkha Justice Campaign input in developing new guidelines by July while giving sympathetic treatment to Gurkhas not meeting the then current immigration guidelines before the development of new guidelines.<ref>{{cite news url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8037181.stm title= Lumley in public clash on Gurkhas publisher= BBC News date= 7 May 2009 accessdate=23 May 2009}}</ref>

Following a Home Affairs Select Committee Commons Home Affairs Committee meeting in which talks were held between campaigners, the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) Ministry of Defence and the Home Office on 19 May, Gordon Brown announced to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom House of Commons on 20 May that the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith would make a statement on the issue the following day.<ref>{{cite news url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/5360033/Gurkhas-in-Britain-a-timeline-of-their-campaign-to-stay.html title= Gurkhas in Britain: a timeline of their campaign to stay work= The Daily Telegraph date= 21 May 2009 accessdate=23 May 2009   location=London}}</ref> Ms Smith subsequently announced that all Gurkha veterans who had served four years or more in the British Army before 1997 would be allowed to settle in Britain.<ref>{{cite news url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8060607.stm title= Gurkhas win right to settle in UK publisher= BBC News date= 21 May 2009 accessdate=23 May 2009}}</ref>

In defence of the Dongria, she has said, <blockquote>"It greatly disturbs me that a British company will be responsible for the destruction of these wonderful people. I urge the public to support the Dongria, who simply want to be allowed to live in peace. Unlike so many of Indias rural poor, the Dongria actually live very well in the Niyamgiri hills, and its a terrible irony that what Vedanta Resources Vedanta is proposing to do in the name of development will actually destroy this completely self-sufficient people."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/4403 title=Joanna Lumley narrates new film about remote tribe first=Survival last=International publisher=}}</ref></blockquote> Lumley also contributed her writing for the book We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples, released in October 2009 with profits going in support of Survival.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/weareone title=We Are One first=Survival last=International publisher=}}</ref> A collection of photographs, statements from tribal people and essays from international authors, the book explores the richness of the cultures of indigenous peoples around the world and the risks to their existence.
