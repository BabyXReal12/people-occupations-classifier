He became the inaugural Breakfast Show presenter on Xfm Manchester upon launch on 15 March 2006, before moving to Xfm London in 2007. There he initially presented a variety of daytime shows to become familiar to listeners, before taking over the Drivetime slot from Richard Bacon (television presenter) Richard Bacon. Following the sudden departure of Lauren Laverne from the Breakfast Show in April 2007, producers called on his experience in Manchester and asked him to step in. This was only a stop-gap solution, however, as he decided to focus on returning to the London stand-up circuit.

He most recently presented the syndicated Saturday lunchtime show, a slot previously occupied by Lauren Laverne, Adam Buxton Adam & Joe Cornish (filmmaker) Joe, and Ricky Gervais/Stephen Merchant, before leaving radio work completely to focus on stand-up comedy.
