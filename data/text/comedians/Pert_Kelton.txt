According to Kelton family history, Jane suggested the name to Perts mother while reminiscing about her career and describing her favorite theatrical role, that of the character "Pert Barlow" in a play called Checkers.<ref>[http://www.playbill.com/playbillpagegallery/inside-playbill?asset=00000150-aea5-d936-a7fd-eef542a50008&type=InsidePlaybill&slide=10 "Whos Who in the Cast: Pert Kelton",] Playbill, March 1958, a cast profile included in preview for The Music Man, which premiered at the Majestic Theatre, New York, N.Y., December 19, 1957.

==Films==
Pert and her parents had moved to California to work in Hollywood films by the latter half of 1927.<ref name=ose/> Her first credited movie role there was as the character Rosie in First National Pictures 1929 release Sally (1929 film) Sally, a production based on the Broadway hit by the same name. With regard to the Kelton familys living arrangements in this period, the 1930 United States Census  federal census of 1930 documents that Pert was residing in Los Angeles at the "Warner-Kelton Hotel",<ref name="1930 Census"/> later called the Hotel Brevoort (and Tropical Gardens)<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/6326+Lexington+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90038/@34.0923165,-118.3274688,93a,35y,180h/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2bf341741d81d:0x2802da3652cdad39!8m2!3d34.0923922!4d-118.3276112?hl=en title=6326 Lexington Ave author= date= website=google.com/maps accessdate=15 August 2018}}</ref> and sharing room 666<ref>{{cite web url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801102646/http://allanellenberger.com/elizabeth-shorts-hollywood/ title=HOLLYWOODLAND » Elizabeth Short’s Hollywood… author=Allan Ellenberger date=29 July 2008 archivedate=1 August 2013 website=allanellenberger.com via=archive.org accessdate=15 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731010854/https://martinturnbull.com/hollywood-places/ title=Hollywood Places author=Martin Turnbull date=31 July 2013 website=martinturnbull.com via=archive.org accessdate=15 August 2018}}</ref><!-- https://martinturnbull.com/timeline-3/ --> That same census identifies all three of the Keltons as employed actors in "motion pictures".<ref name="1930 Census"/>

Pert was a young comedienne in A-list movies during the 1930s, often portraying the leading ladys wisecracking friend. She had a memorable turn in 1933 as dance hall singer "Trixie" in The Bowery (1933 film) The Bowery alongside Wallace Beery, George Raft, Jackie Cooper, and Fay Wray. Directed by Raoul Walsh, the film is based on the story of Steve Brodie (bridge jumper) Steve Brodie, the first man who reportedly jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge in 1886 and lived to brag about it. Kelton at one point in the film sings to a rowdy, appreciative crowd in an energetic Dive bar dive, using a curious New York accent to good comedic effect, with Beery and Raft arguing afterwards over her attentions.

In Gregory LaCavas 1933 pre-Code comedy Bed of Roses (1933 film) Bed of Roses, Kelton plays Minnie, a witty prostitute who is a partner in crime with Lorry, portrayed by Constance Bennett. The two women in the plot are fond of getting admiring men helplessly drunk before robbing them, at least until getting caught and tossed back into jail. Kelton has all the best lines, surprisingly wicked and amusing observations that would never be allowed in an American film after the Hollywood Production Code was adopted. The movie remains realistic in terms of the interactions of the characters and features an early turn by Joel McCrea as the leading man, a small boat skipper who pulls Bennett from the river after she dives into the water to escape capture. 

Kelton for the remainder of the 1930s performed in over 20 more feature films and Film short shorts.<ref>[http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/SearchResult.aspx?s=&retailCheck=&Type=PN&CatID=DATABIN_CAST&ID=123589&AN_ID=&searchedFor=Pert_Kelton_ "Pert Kelton"], filmography, American Film Institute (AFI), Los Angeles, California.

She did not return to the "big screen" until 1962, when she was cast as Mrs. Paroo in The Music Man (1962 film) The Music Man.

==Radio and return to New York==
By April 1940, Pert had left California and was living in New York City again, sharing a $65-per-month apartment in Manhattan on West 55th Street with three other women, two of whom were employed as dancers in the theatre and the other roommate was working as a secretary.<ref name="1940 Census">[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QSQ-G9MY-RFQL?cc=2000219 "The Sixteenth Census of the United States: 1940"], enumeration date April 23, 1940, Manhattan Borough, New York County, New York. FamilySearch. Retrieved September 6, 2017.</ref> A federal census taker canvassing Manhattan that year concisely identified Kelton in his Census enumeration ledger as "Actress, Theatre & Movies" and recorded her given age as only 28, although in the spring of 1940 Pert was actually 32 years old.<ref name="1940 Census"/> If not a mistake in documentation, it is possible that Kelton herself, feeling the pressures to maintain a youthful profile within the image-conscious realm of entertainment, "shaved" a few years off her age when answering census questions at that time. Her documented lack of consistent employment during the previous year may be indicative too of the professional pressures she was experiencing after her film career in Hollywood began to wane in the late 1930s. According to the United States Census of 1940, Kelton was employed for only six weeks during the entire year of 1939, a total time of employment far less than the weeks worked by her roommates over the same period.<ref name="1940 Census"/>

Once Kelton had resettled in New York during the early 1940s, she began to work in theatre again, and she became a familiar voice on radio as well, performing on programs such as Easy Aces, Its Always Albert, The Stu Erwin Show, and on the 1941 soap opera We Are Always Young. Later, In 1949, she did the voices of five different radio characters on Texaco Star Theater The Milton Berle Show. She was also a regular cast member of The Henry Morgan (comedian) Henry Morgan Show; and in the early 1950s, she performed the role of the tart maid in the Monty Woolley vehicle The Magnificent Montague.

== Television ==
Kelton appeared in Henry Morgans Great Talent Hunt, first aired January 26, 1951, hosted by Henry Morgan (comedian) Henry Morgan, and with Kaye Ballard, Art Carney, and Arnold Stang.

Kelton was the original Alice Kramden in The Honeymooners comedy sketches on the DuMont Television Networks Cavalcade of Stars. These sketches formed the eventual basis for the 1955 CBS Television sitcom The Honeymooners. Jackie Gleason starred as her husband Ralph Kramden, and Art Carney as their upstairs neighbor Ed Norton. Elaine Stritch played Trixie, the burlesque dancer wife of Norton, for one sketch before being replaced by Joyce Randolph.

Kelton appeared in the original sketches, generally running about 10 to 20 minutes, shorter than the later one-season half-hour series episodes and 1960s hour-long musical versions. However, she was abruptly dropped from her role as a result of blacklisting and was replaced by Audrey Meadows; rather than acknowledge that she was being blacklisted, her producers explained that her departure was based on alleged heart problems. In his book The Forgotten Network, David Weinstein says Kelton remained on Cavalcade of Stars through the final season of the series (1951-1952), and suggests that it may have been because Jackie Gleason had resisted attempts at having her dropped.

In the 1960s, Kelton was invited back to Gleasons CBS show to play Alices mother in an episode of the hour-long musical version of The Honeymooners (also known as The Color Honeymooners), with Sheila MacRae as a fetching young Alice. By this time, the original age discrepancies were reversed, with Ralph married to a much younger Alice than himself. Gleason had been one of big-name celebrities who sought to end the widespread paranoia and hysteria being caused by the blacklist, as many others in the entertainment industry had also rejected the Red Scare of the 1950s.

In 1963 Kelton appeared on The Twilight Zone, playing the overbearing mother of Robert Duvall in the episode "Miniature (The Twilight Zone) Miniature." The next year she guest-starred on the popular family Situation comedy sitcom My Three Sons starring Fred MacMurray as Steve Douglas and William Frawley as Bub OCasey.  In that series episode "Stage Door Bub", Kelton portrays Thelma Wilson, a veteran itinerant stage actress who longs for a settled domestic life but soon realizes that lifestyle is actually ill-suited for her personality.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0655092/ "Stage Door Bub", My Three Sons, S04E24, originally broadcast February 27, 1964. Internet Movie Database (IMDb), a subsidiary of Amazon.com Amazon, Seattle, Washington. Retrieved August 30, 2017.</ref>  In her last years, Kelton was also strongly identified with Spic and Span because of her televised commercials on behalf of that cleaning product.

== Broadway ==

In her 1925 Broadway debut in Sunny (musical) Sunny, Kelton had played the character Magnolia and performed a song with the same title as the play. Years later, she was twice nominated for Tony Awards: in 1960, as Best Supporting or Featured Actress (Musical) for Frank Loessers Greenwillow; and in 1967-1968, as Best Supporting or Featured Actress (Dramatic) for Spofford. Her most memorable Broadway role, however, was her portrayal of the impatient Mrs. Paroo, the Irish mother of the town librarian Marian Paroo (Barbara Cook), in Meredith Willsons The Music Man, which premiered at the Majestic Theatre (Broadway) Majestic Theatre in New York in December 1957. She reprised her Broadway character in the film adaptation of The Music Man (1962 film) The Music Man in 1962.
