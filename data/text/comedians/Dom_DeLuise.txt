==Early life==
DeLuise was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Italian American parents Vincenza "Jennie" (married and maiden names née DeStefano), a homemaker, and John DeLuise, a public employee (garbage collector). He was the youngest of three children, having an older brother, Nicholas "Nick" DeLuise, and an older sister, Antoinette DeLuise-Daurio.<ref name="filmref">{{cite web  title=Dom Deluise Biography (1933- )  url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/57/Dom-Deluise.html  date=  publisher=filmreference.com  accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref>  DeLuise graduated from Manhattans High School of Performing Arts and later attended Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts.<ref name="TimesBio">{{cite news  url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/87126/Dom-DeLuise/biography  work=New York Times  publisher=NYTimes.com  title=Dom DeLuise Biography  date=  accessdate=May 18, 2011  author=Nathan Southern}}</ref> DeLuise was Roman Catholic and had a particular devotion to the Virgin Mary.<ref>{{cite web url=http://ccc.usccb.org/video/one2one/deluise_dom.asf  title=Archived copy  accessdate=November 20, 2011  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706124036/http://ccc.usccb.org/video/one2one/deluise_dom.asf  archivedate=July 6, 2011  df= }}</ref>

==Career==
In 1961 DeLuise played in the Off-Broadway musical revue "Another Evening with Harry Stoons" <ref>{{cite web title=Barbra Archives url=http://barbra-archives.com/live/60s/harry_stoones_streisand.html accessdate=February 17, 2013}}</ref> that lasted nine previews and one performance.<ref>{{cite web last=Streisand first=Barbra title=Value url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt-Sy6T3Y20 work=Live at the Bon Soir (1962) accessdate=February 17, 2013}}</ref> Another member of the cast was 19-year-old Barbra Streisand.  He was also in the Off-Broadway play "all in Love" which opened on November 10, 1961, at the Martinique Theatre and ran for 141 performances.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/shows/cast.php?showid=3132#content title=All in Love Original Off-Broadway Cast - 1961 Off-Broadway website=www.broadwayworld.com access-date=November 25, 2016}}</ref> Other New York theater performances include, "Half-Past Wednesday" [Off-Broadway] (1962), "Around the World in 80 Days" [Off-Broadway] (1963), "The Student Gypsy" [Broadway] (1963), "Heres Love" [Broadway] (1963), and "Last of the Red Hot Lovers" [Broadway] (1969).<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Dom-De-Luise/ title=Dom DeLuise Theatre Credits website=www.broadwayworld.com access-date=November 25, 2016}}</ref>

DeLuise generally appeared in comedic parts, although an early appearance in the movie Fail-Safe (1964 film) Fail-Safe as a nervous USAF technical sergeant showed a broader range. His first acting credit was as a regular performer in the television show The Entertainers in 1964. He gained early notice for his supporting turn in the Doris Day film The Glass Bottom Boat (1966). In his New York Times review, Vincent Canby panned the film but singled out the actor, stating, "[T]he best of the lot, however, is a newcomer, Dom DeLuise, as a portly, bird-brained spy."<ref name="canby">{{cite news  title=Movie Review: The Glass Bottom Boat (1966)  author=Vincent Canby  date=June 10, 1966  work=New York Times  publisher=NYTimes.com  url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E01E7DD133DE43BBC4852DFB066838D679EDE  accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref>

In the 1970s and 1980s, he often co-starred with Burt Reynolds. Together they appeared in the films The Cannonball Run (film) The Cannonball Run and Cannonball Run II, Smokey and the Bandit II, The End (1978 film) The End, All Dogs Go to Heaven and The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film) The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. DeLuise was the :wikt:host host of the television show Candid Camera from 1991-92.

DeLuise also lent his distinct voice to various animation animated films and was a particular staple of Don Bluths features, playing major roles in The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail, A Troll in Central Park and All Dogs Go to Heaven.  All Dogs Go to Heaven also featured Reynolds voice as Charlie B. Barkin, the cheeky Antihero anti-hero, and DeLuise voiced Itchy Itchiford, Charlies best friend, wing-man and later partner in business. Unlike DeLuise, however, Reynolds did not voice Charlie in any of the eventual film sequels, TV episodes, TV-episode sequels, or TV series. DeLuise also voiced the legendary character of Charles Dickens Fagin in the Walt Disney Animation Studios Walt Disney film Oliver & Company and made voice guest appearances on several animated TV series.File:Dom deluise handprint.JPG thumb right The handprints of Dom DeLuise in Atlantic City, New Jersey

TV producer Greg Garrison hired DeLuise to appear as a specialty act on The Dean Martin Show. DeLuise ran through his "Dominick the Great" routine, a riotous example of a magic act gone wrong, with host Martin as a bemused volunteer from the audience. Doms catch phrase, with an Italian accent, was "No Applause Please, Save-a to the End." The show went so well that DeLuise was soon a regular on Martins program, participating in both songs and sketches. Garrison also featured DeLuise in his own hour-long comedy specials for American Broadcasting Company ABC. (Martin was often just off-camera when these were taped, and his distinctive laugh can be heard loud and clear.) In 1968 he hosted his own hour-long comedy variety series for CBS, The Dom DeLuise Show. Taped in Miami at The Jackie Gleason Theater it featured many regular Gleason show cast members including The June Taylor Dancers and The Sammy Spear Orchestra. Doms wife Carol Arthur also regularly appeared. The 16-week run was the summer replacement for The Jonathan Winters Show. He later starred in his own sitcom, Lotsa Luck, which only lasted for 1973-1974 season.

DeLuise was probably best known as a regular in Mel Brooks films. He appeared in The Twelve Chairs (1970 film) The Twelve Chairs, Blazing Saddles, Silent Movie, History of the World, Part I, Spaceballs, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. Brooks late wife, actress Anne Bancroft, directed Dom in Fatso (1980 film) Fatso (1980).<ref name="horror">{{cite web  url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/36304/horror-oscars-part-2-this-time-it%E2%80%99s-personal  title=Horror at the Oscars Part 2: This Time it’s Personal  date=March 9, 2010  author=Heather Buckley  publisher=Dreadcentral.com  accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref> He also had a Cameo appearance cameo in Johnny Dangerously as the Pope and in Jim Hensons The Muppet Movie as a wayward Hollywood talent agent who comes across Kermit the Frog singing "The Rainbow Connection" in the films opening scene. He also appeared with fellow Brooks regulars Gene Wilder (who directed the film as well), Marty Feldman, and Madeline Kahn in The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes Smarter Brother, as well as alongside Wilder and Gilda Radner in a later Gene Wilder-directed film, Haunted Honeymoon. He also appeared in Stargate SG-1 as Urgo.

DeLuise exhibited his comedic talents while playing the speaking part of the jailer Frosch in the comedic operetta Die Fledermaus at the Metropolitan Opera, playing the role in four separate revivals of the work at the Met between December 1989 and January 1996. In the production, while the singing was in German, the spoken parts were in English. A lifelong opera fan, he also portrayed the role of LOpinion Publique in drag for the Los Angeles Operas production of Jacques Offenbach Offenbachs Orpheus in the Underworld.<ref name="opera">{{cite news  date= July 2009  volume=74  issue=1  accessdate=June 20, 2009  url=http://www.operanews.com/operanews/templates/content.aspx?id=2299  title=Obituaries: Actors Dom DeLuise and Beatrice Arthur; mezzo Margreta Elkins; soprano Anne Brown, Gershwins original Bess; composer Lukas Foss dies at eighty-six.  work=Opera News  author=}}</ref>

An avid cook and author of several books on cooking, he appeared as a regular contributor to a syndicated home improvement radio show, On The House with The Carey Brothers, giving listeners tips on culinary topics.<ref name="house">{{cite web  url=http://www.onthehouse.com/sections/features/dom  title=In The Kitchen with Dom DeLuise  publisher=OnTheHouse.com  date=  accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref> He was also a friend and self-proclaimed "look-alike" of famous Cajun chef Paul Prudhomme and author of seven childrens books.

==Personal life==
In 1964, while working in summer theater in Provincetown, Massachusetts, DeLuise met his wife, actress Carol Arthur, they married in 1965;<ref name="LATimes">{{cite news first=Dennis last=McLellan url=http://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-dom-deluise6-2009may06,0,6461527.story  title=Dom DeLuise dies at 75; actor was a naturally funny man  work=Los Angeles Times publisher=Tronc location=Los Angeles, California date=May 6, 2009 accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref><ref name="nytimes1">{{cite web first=William last=Grimes  url=https://nytimes.com/2009/05/07/movies/07deluise.html  title=Dom DeLuise, Comic Actor, Dies at 75  work=The New York Times  publisher=New York Times Company location=New York City date=May 5, 2009  accessdate=June 27, 2017}}</ref> together they had three sons, Peter DeLuise Peter, Michael DeLuise Michael and David DeLuise who are also actors.<ref name="nytimes1"/>

==Death==
{{wikinews American comedic actor Dom DeLuise dies at age 75}}
DeLuise died on May 4, 2009, at Saint Johns Health Center in Santa Monica, California.<ref name="nytimes1" /> He was hospitalized at the time, suffering from kidney failure and respiratory problems due to complications from diabetes and high blood pressure. He suffered from cancer for more than a year prior to his death.<ref>{{cite news  title= Dom DeLuise dies at 75  publisher=CNN  date=June 6, 2011  url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/05/obit.deluise/index.html  accessdate=May 5, 2009}}</ref>

His family was by his side at the time of his death. His good friend Burt Reynolds made a statement to the Los Angeles Times, saying: "As you get older and start to lose people you love, you think about it more, and I was dreading this moment. Dom always made you feel better when he was around, and there will never be another like him."<ref name="msnbc">{{cite news  title=Actor, Dom DeLuise dies at 75  url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30581493/ publisher=MSNBC/Associated Press  date=May 5, 2009  accessdate=May 5, 2009}}</ref> Mel Brooks also made a statement to the same paper, telling them that DeLuise "created so much joy and laughter on the set that you couldn’t get your work done. So every time I made a movie with Dom, I would plan another two days on the schedule just for laughter. Its a sad day. Its hard to think of this life and this world without him."<ref name="LATimes"/>
