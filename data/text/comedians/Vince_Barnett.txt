Vince Barnett (July 4, 1902 &ndash; August 10, 1977) was an American film actor. He appeared on stage originally before appearing in more than 400 films between 1930 and 1975.

==Early years==
Barnett was born July 4, 1902, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Luke Barnett, a well-known comedian who specialized in insulting and pulling practical jokes on his audiences.<ref name=ecf>Aaker, Everett (2006). Encyclopedia of Early Television Crime Fighters. McFarland & Company, Inc. {{ISBN 978-0-7864-6409-8}}. Pp. 32-34.</ref> (Lukes professional nickname was "Old Man Ribber" and "the King of Ribbing".)

Barnett graduated from Duquesne University Prep School and Carnegie Institute of Technology.<ref name=ig/> An avid amateur pilot, he flew mail planes for a couple of years.

==Ribbing==
"Barnett for years [was] known in Hollywood as the professional ribber -- appearing at banquets and parties as a paid insulter."<ref>{{cite news title="Scarface" Finally Passed by Censors url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3538759/cumberland_sunday_times/ agency=Cumberland Sunday Times date=July 3, 1932 page=7 via = Newspapers.com accessdate = November 1, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref> He would insult the guests in a thick German accent, spill the soup and drop the trays—all to the great delight of hosts who enjoyed watching their friends squirm and mutter "Who hired that jerk?"

"Among the celebrated victims of his practical jokes were President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Bernard Shaw, Henry Ford, and Charles Lindbergh."<ref name=fe>Katz, Ephraim (1979).

==Stage==
Barnett made his stage debut with Earl Carrolls Vanities in 1926. The following year, he acted on Broadway in George Whites Scandals.

==Film==
Barnetts initial involvement with Hollywood was as a screenwriter,<ref name=ls>{{cite news title=Remember Vince Barnett? url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3538858/the_lowell_sun/ agency=The Lowell Sun date=June 21, 1972 page=11 via = Newspapers.com accessdate = November 1, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref> "writing screenplays for the two-reeler movies of the late 1920s."<ref name=ig>{{cite news title=Heinz Hosts Native Son url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3538917/the_indiana_gazette/ agency=The Indiana Gazette date=June 10, 1972 page=31 via = Newspapers.com accessdate = November 1, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref> He went on to appear in more than 400 films.<ref name=oj/>

The diminutive, chrome-domed Barnett also appeared in the 1926 edition of Earl Carrolls Vanities. He began appearing in films in 1930, playing hundreds of comedy bits and supporting parts until retiring in 1975. Among his more sizable screen roles was the moronic, illiterate gangster "secretary" in Scarface (1932 film) Scarface. From 1930 Barnett appeared, usually as comedy relief, in films and on television in a career spanning 45 years. Among his best-regarded early roles, apart from Scarface, were The Big Cage (1933), Thirty Day Princess (1934) and, in a perfectly suited Runyonesque part, Princess OHara (1935). In later years, Vince often relinquished his comedy image and was seen in innumerable small roles, often as careworn little men, undertakers, janitors, bartenders and drunks in pictures ranging from films noir (The Killers (1946 film) The Killers, 1946) to westerns (Springfield Rifle (film) Springfield Rifle, 1952).

==Later years==
In one of his last public appearances, Vince showcased his unique brand of humour with a monologue, delivered at Madison Square Garden in the vaudeville revue The Big Show of 1936.<ref>{{cite news last1=Johnson first1=Nels title=Familiar Names Still Bask In Limelight of Vaudeville url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3540206/daily_independent_journal/ agency=Daily Independent Journal date=August 8, 1972 page=12 via = Newspapers.com accessdate = November 2, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref>
