Castellaneta became adept at impressions at a young age and his mother enrolled him in an acting class when he was sixteen years old. He would listen to his fathers comedy records and do impressions of the artists.<ref name="The Age"/> He was a "devotee" of the works of many performers, including Alan Arkin and Barbara Harris (actress) Barbara Harris and directors Mike Nichols and Elaine May.<ref name="matthau"/> He attended Oak Park and River Forest High School<ref>{{Cite news title=A storied history of excellence work=Chicago Sun-Times date=May 9, 2007}}</ref> and upon graduation, started attending Northern Illinois University (NIU) in the fall of 1975.<ref name="Laziest">{{Cite news  title=I Am Not Homer&nbsp;– The voice of TVs laziest nuclear-safety engineer looks back on his start in DeKalb author=Parisi, Tom date=August 23, 2002 work=The Beacon News}}</ref>

Castellaneta studied art education, with the goal of becoming an art teacher.<ref name="The Age"/> He became a student teacher and would entertain his students with his impressions.<ref name="matthau"/><ref name="The Age"/> Castellaneta was a regular participant in The Ron Petke and His Dead Uncle Show, a radio show at NIU. The show helped Castellaneta hone his skills as a voice-over actor. He recalled "We did parodies and sketches, we would double up on, so you learned to switch between voices. I got my feet wet doing voiceover. The show was just barely audible, but we didnt care. It was the fact that we got a chance to do it and write our own material."<ref name="Laziest"/> He took a play-writing class and auditioned for an improvisational show. A classmate first thought Castellaneta would "fall on his face with improvisation" but soon "was churning out material faster than [they] could make it work."<ref name="Laziest"/>

==Career==
===Early career===
Castellaneta started acting after his graduation from Northern Illinois University in 1979. He decided that if his career went nowhere he would still have a chance to try something else.<ref name="The Age"/> He began taking improvisation classes, where he met his future wife Deb Lacusta. He started to work at The Second City, an improvisational theatre in Chicago, in 1983 and continued to work there until 1987.<ref name="matthau"/> During this period, he did voice-over work with his wife for various radio stations.<ref name="The Age"/>

He auditioned for a role in The Tracey Ullman Show and his first meeting underwhelmed Tracey Ullman and the other producers. Ullman decided to fly to Chicago to watch Castellaneta perform. His performance that night was about a blind man who tries to become a comedian and Ullman later recalled that although there were flashier performances that night, Castellaneta made her cry. She was impressed and Castellaneta was hired.<ref name="matthau"/>

===The Simpsons===
Castellaneta is most famous for his role as Homer Simpson on the longest running animated television show The Simpsons. The Tracey Ullman Show included a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta and fellow cast member Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge Simpson rather than hire more actors.<ref name="The Age">{{cite news url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/27/1046064146568.html title=Doh, youre the voice accessdate=February 15, 2009 date=February 27, 2003 author=Lee, Luaine work=The Age location=Melbourne}}</ref><ref name="FN">{{cite news  url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,129665,00.html title=Doh!: The Voice of Homer Is Deceivingly Deadpan accessdate=February 15, 2009 date=August 18, 2007 author=Elber, Lynn publisher=Fox News Channel FOX News}}</ref> Homers voice began as a loose impression of Walter Matthau, but Castellaneta could not "get enough power behind that voice" and could not sustain his Matthau impression for the nine- to ten-hour long recording sessions.<ref name="MTV">{{cite news url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml title=Simpsons Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To Burns-Sexual Smithers accessdate=February 15, 2009 date=July 26, 2007 author=Carroll, Larry publisher=MTV deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220140402/http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml archivedate=December 20, 2007}}</ref>

Castellaneta first tried using Hispanic voicing, which Simon felt was too clichéd. He then tried a "big dumb Sweden Swede", which was also rejected.

In the early 1990s, Castellaneta and Deb Lacusta wrote a script for an episode in which Barney becomes sober. They pitched their idea to showrunner Al Jean. Jean liked the story, but turned it down because he felt that it was too similar to "Duffless", an episode that the writers were already working on. They waited several years and offered their script, which they updated, to then-show runner Mike Scully, who liked it and had them make a few changes.<ref name="Wine">Affleck, Neil; Castellaneta, Dan; Lacusta, Deb; Maxtone-Graham, Ian; Meyer, George; Scully, Mike (2008).

The majority of the sketches had been written and performed before the CD was recorded, and Castellaneta thought that it would be a good idea to preserve them "since [he and Lacusta] dont perform them much anymore."<ref name=celebcafe/>

Some came from their sketch series on a local radio station in Chicago and had to be lengthened from the "two-minute bits" that they were originally, while several others were stage sketches performed in a comedy club in Santa Monica, California Santa Monica.<ref name=barnes>{{cite news url=http://video.barnesandnoble.com/search/Interview.asp?CTR=583498 title=The Voice Behind Homer Simpson Steps into the Spotlight and...Doh! accessdate=November 20, 2007 date=April 25, 2002 publisher=Barnes & Noble}}</ref> Additionally, "Citizen Kane", a sketch in which two people discuss the film Citizen Kane with different meanings, was something the pair had performed at an art gallery.<ref name=barnes/> Castellaneta noted that "we already knew that these skits were funny, [but] some of them we polished and tightened."<ref name=barnes/> The skits were principally written by improvising from a basic point, transcribing the results and then editing them to the finished scene.<ref name=barnes/> Castellaneta chose the title I Am Not Homer as a parody of Leonard Nimoys famous first autobiography I Am Not Spock, as well as to show that most of the comedy featured "is not the typical Homer Simpson Homer comedy."<ref name=celebcafe>{{cite news url=http://www.thecelebritycafe.com/interviews/dan_castellaneta.html  title=Castellaneta, Dan&nbsp;— voice of Homer Simpson  accessdate=November 19, 2007  author=Miserandino, Dominick A.  publisher=The Celebrity Cafe  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212114904/http://thecelebritycafe.com/interviews/dan_castellaneta.html  archivedate=December 12, 2007  df= }}</ref>
