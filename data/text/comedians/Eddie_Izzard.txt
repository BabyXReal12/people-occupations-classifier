His mother was a midwife and nurse, while his father was an accountant who was working in Aden with BP British Petroleum at the time of Izzards birth.
When Izzard was one year old, the family moved to Northern Ireland, settling in Bangor, County Down and living there until Izzard was five.
The family then moved to Wales, where they lived in Skewen, West Glamorgan.

Izzard began to toy with comedy at the University of Sheffield, with student friend Rob Ballard.

==Comic style==

Izzard uses a stream-of-consciousness delivery that jumps between topics. As he put it in a 2004 interview with The Guardian, "Its the oral tradition. Human beings have been doing it for thousands of years".
His bent towards the surreal even went so far as to produce a sitcom called Cows (TV series) Cows in 1997 for Channel 4, a live action comedy with actors dressed in cowsuits.
==Political views and activism==
Izzard has engaged in campaigning work. He is especially well known as a pro-European Union campaigner, supporting the further integration of the UK into the EU. In May 2005, he appeared on the BBCs political debate show Question Time (TV series) Question Time, describing himself as a "British-European", comparing this with other cultural identities such as "African-American".

and occasionally in German language German.
On 16 June 2017, on the "Overtime" segment of HBO political talk show Real Time with Bill Maher, Izzard claimed to be working in four languages: Spanish, German, French and English.

In July 2003, Izzard received an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of East Anglia University of East Anglia, Norwich, for "pro-Europe campaigning", "his contribution to promoting modern languages and tolerance of other cultures and lifestyles", and for having "transcended national barriers" with his humour.

Izzard appeared in literature to support changing the British electoral system from first-past-the-post to Instant-runoff voting alternative vote for electing Members of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom House of Commons in the United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011 Alternative Vote referendum in 2011.
In 2011, Izzard revealed that he had political ambitions and wanted to become an MP, Mayor, or MEP by 2020.
On 25 February 2016, Izzard announced his intention to stand for the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.
It was announced on 9 August 2016 that Izzard had failed to be elected to the NEC.
On 20 July 2006, he received an honorary doctorate in Letters from the Faculty of Arts at the University of Sheffield,

In March 2014, Izzard began leading a campaign encouraging Scots not to vote for independence in the Scottish independence referendum, 2014 September referendum, saying that England would feel a "deep sense of loss" if Scotland were to leave the UK.
Izzard is an outspoken supporter of the Labour Party. In September 2011, he declared his ambition to stand for the party in the future as an Member of Parliament MP, Member of European Parliament MEP, or Mayor of London,
announcing an intention to stand for the London mayoral election in 2020.
When asked on comedy panel show The Last Leg why he thought he might be elected, he replied "Boris Johnson".
He is also a Republicanism in the United Kingdom republican, believing that Britain should have a democratically elected head of state.
He has stated that he is a social democrat, not a socialist.
Izzard confirmed his support for Labour in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 2015 general election, attending a party rally with fellow comedian Ben Elton and actress Sally Lindsay in April 2015.
On 27 July 2009, with only 5 weeks training and no significant prior running experience, Izzard began seven weeks of back-to-back marathon runs (with Sundays off) across the UK to raise money for Sport Relief. He ran from London to Cardiff to Belfast to Edinburgh and back to London, carrying the flag of the country — England, Scotland, or Wales — in which he was running. In Northern Ireland he carried a self-designed green flag bearing a white dove.

On 16 February 2016 the BBC announced that Izzard would attempt to run 27 marathons in 27 days, through South Africa for Sport Relief.
The significance of the number 27 came from the number of years spent in prison by Nelson Mandela. In total Izzard would aim to run more than 700 miles, in temperatures of up to 40 °C. Izzard completed his first marathon on 23 February. He attempted such a project in South Africa in 2012, but withdrew with health concerns.
He completed the marathon challenge on 20 March, at the statue of Mandela in front of the Union Buildings in Pretoria. Because he had spent one day in hospital, he had to run two consecutive marathons on this last day. He raised more than £1.35M for Sport Relief.
A BBC documentary, detailing his feat, was broadcast on 28 March.
In May 2017, Izzard declared his intention to become a Labour politician after endorsing Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the United Kingdom general election, 2017 2017 UK general election. He said: "I like Jeremy Corbyn. He believes in what he says."
In October, he announced a renewed bid for election to Labours National Executive Committee.
In January 2018, it was announced that Izzard had failed in his second bid to be elected to the NEC.
On 31 March 2018, Christine Shawcroft resigned from the Labour Partys NEC. Izzard automatically replaced her and will serve until the next NEC election, to be held in summer 2018.
==Personal life==
During his 2008 Stripped tour, Izzard said he realised he was an atheist. He said, "I was warming the material up in New York, where one night, literally on stage, I realised I didnt believe in God at all. I just didnt think there was anyone upstairs."
He has since described himself as a spiritual atheist, saying, "I dont believe in the guy upstairs, I believe in us."
Izzard keeps his romantic life private, citing the wishes of his companions not wanting to become content for his show.
He dated Sarah Townsend, who later directed the documentary Believe: The Eddie Izzard Story,
and whom he first met while she was running a Edinburgh Festival Fringe Fringe venue at the Edinburgh Festival in 1989.
Izzard supports Crystal Palace F.C. Crystal Palace FC and became an associate director at the club on 16 July 2012.
Izzard started to freely talk about his transvestism in venues like the Edinburgh Festival as early as 1992.
His stance is that cross-dressing is neither part of his performance nor a sexual fetish.
He remarks in his show Unrepeatable that "women wear what they want and so do I". According to Izzard, "Most transvestites fancy women."
He calls himself "a heterosexual straight transvestite, or male lesbian".
He has also said he is "a lesbian trapped in a mans body",
transgender,
and "a complete boy plus half girl".
He has expressed a belief that being transgender is caused by genetics and that someday this will be scientifically proven, having gone so far as to have his own genome sequenced.
==Critical reception ==
