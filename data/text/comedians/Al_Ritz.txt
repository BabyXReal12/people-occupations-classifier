After the three Joachim brothers graduated from high school, they decided to team up as a song-and-comedy act. The brothers began using the name "Ritz" for their nightclub act reportedly after seeing the name on the side of a laundry truck. With fourth brother George acting as their agent, the Ritz Brothers worked nightclubs and vaudeville. The act consisted of the trio indulging in precision dancing, tongue-twisting lampoons of popular stories and songs, and slapstick.<ref name=grave/>

Sing, Baby, Sing (1936) was the first feature film to costar the Ritzes, and, their first starring role followed a year later in Life Begins in College.<ref name=grave/>
