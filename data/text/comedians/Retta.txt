Eventually she moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in comedy.
Retta started performing stand-up comedy in 1996, although she said she did not start "earning money" until 1998, when she began touring on the college circuit. Retta said she used to get "really nauseated" before a performance, but that the feeling passed with experience.
Retta has said her stand-up material tends to be slightly embellished stories from her regular everyday life, family, and friends.

During a stand-up performance at the University of Illinois at Springfield, Retta said the acting job on the show was stressful because it was unclear how long the show would stay on the air, due to the poor reviews it received during the Parks and Recreation (season 1) first season.
