She is known for her role as the brash, wisecracking sidekick to Thelma Todd in a series of short comedy films produced by Hal Roach in the 1930s. Known as the Queen of Wisecracks, Kellys career continued after Todds death in 1935 in similar roles.

After her film career declined in the mid-1940s, Kelly returned to New York where she worked in radio and Summer stock theatre summer stock. She also became a lifelong friend and personal assistant of Tallulah Bankhead. Kelly returned to the screen after 17 years with guest spots on television and in film roles.

==Early life and early career==

Kelly was born Sarah Veronica Rose Kelly in Brooklyn to Irish immigrants parents John (died 1942) and Delia Kelly (1875-1930). She began her career in vaudeville as a dancer at the age of 12.
She performed in Frank Fay (American actor) Frank Fays act, first in a song-and-dance routine and later as Fays comic foil.
In one routine, Kelly told Fay and the audience that she had been at the beauty parlor. Fay remarked, "And they didnt wait on you?"
She remained with Fay for several seasons until Fay eventually dismissed her.
Kelly made her Broadway theatre Broadway debut in 1928. In 1930 and 1931, she performed for producer Earl Carroll in his Sketches and Vanities musicals.

==Film career==
Kelly made her screen debut in a Vitaphone short subject filmed there. In 1933 producer Hal Roach hired Kelly to co-star with Thelma Todd in a series of short-subject comedies. The Todd-Kelly shorts cemented Kellys image: a brash, wisecracking woman who frequently punctured the pomposity of other characters. Later entries in the series showcased Kellys dancing skills. Kelly made 35 shorts with Todd before Todd died in 1935. Lyda Roberti replaced Todd, but died of heart failure in 1938.
After the popularity of shorts began to wane, Kelly moved to full-length feature films, often playing working-class character roles in comedies and musicals. One of her memorable roles was as Etta, the cook, in the five Academy Awards-nominated 1938 comedy movie Merrily We Live.{{citation needed date=May 2016}}

By 1943, Kellys film career had begun to decline. She appeared in films for Producers Releasing Corporation, the smallest and cheapest of the movie studios. Her last starring roles were in two PRC comedies, My Son, the Hero and Danger! Women at Work, both released in 1943. Kelly left Hollywood and would not make another film for 17 years.{{citation needed date=May 2016}}
