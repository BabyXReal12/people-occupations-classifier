Gervais then came to much wider national attention with an obnoxious, cutting persona featured in a topical slot that replaced Ali Gs segments on the satirical Channel 4 comedy programme The 11 OClock Show in early 1999, in which his character used as many Profanity expletives as was possible and produced an inordinate amount of politically incorrect statements. Among the other regular featured comedians on the show was Mackenzie Crook, later a co-star of The Office (UK TV series) The Office. Two years later, Gervais went on to present his own comedy chat show for Channel 4 called Meet Ricky Gervais; it was poorly received and has since been mocked by Gervais himself.

====The Office====
{{Main The Office (UK TV series)}}
The Office (UK TV series) The Office started when Stephen Merchant, while on a BBC production course, had to make his own short film. In August 1999 he made a docu-soap parody, set in an office, with help from Ash Atalla, who was shown a 7-minute video called The Seedy Boss. Thus David Brent was created. Merchant passed this tape on to the BBCs Head of Entertainment Paul Jackson (producer) Paul Jackson at the Edinburgh Fringe, who then passed it on to Head of Comedy Jon Plowman, who eventually commissioned a full-pilot script from Merchant and Gervais.
The first six-episode series of The Office aired in the UK in July and August 2001 to little fanfare or attention.

The Guardian{{}}s Chris Tryhorn explained the "few gripes" he had with Extras, "particularly in the second series". "You can forgive Gervais a certain arrogance after the success of The Office, but..." He remarks on the confused tone of the series, taking in the clash between the broad comedy of characters Barry (Shaun Williamson) and Darren (Stephen Merchant), and the apparent parody of this style with When The Whistle Blows, and "given their total indulgence of Gervais, the BBC is portrayed as interfering, its comedy department run by a rather crudely stereotyped gay couple".

He joined Twitter in December 2009 when he first hosted the 66th Golden Globes.
After a two-year hiatus, he returned in September 2011.
In 2012, Gervais won a Shorty Award for Lifetime Achievement for his popular presence on social media.
As of March 2015 he was followed by 7 million fans whom he calls Twonks.
He uses social media to promote his work to his fans. After 10 years Gervais brought back his character Brent on his YouTube channel in a web series Learn Guitar with David Brent.
Gervais uses many ways to promote his new series, for example for Derek, he posts contests or questions for his fans.
Gervais uses social media to raise awareness of animal welfare. He tweets links to petitions to rescue animals from captivity, he highlights the plight of animals being used for testing, and he encourages people to adopt dogs instead of buying them from breeders.
Gervais won the Genesis Award from the Humane Society in March 2015 for his contribution to raising awareness for animal welfare on social media.
In 2014, he was named most influential London Twitter user.
==Charity work==

===Boxing===
In 2002, Gervais took part in a Charitable cause charity boxing match against Grant Bovey, for the UK charity telethon Comic Relief. He was trained for the three-round contest by famous boxing trainer brothers Frank Maloney Frank and Eugene Maloney, at their Fight Factory gymnasium. It was the second televised charity boxing match, the first being Bob Mortimer against Les Dennis. The fight was televised by the BBC, and Gervais came out on top by a split decision verdict.
He donated his £5,000 prize money to the training of a Macmillan Cancer Support Macmillan nurse who specialised in cancer support.

===Animal rights===
Gervais is a supporter of animal rights and has stated that he will leave his fortune to animal charities.
He has spoken out against fox hunting and bullfighting, and wrote to then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown urging him to stop the use of American black bear black bear fur as caps for the Foot Guards.
In 2013, Gervais was named Person of the Year by PETA for his work on curbing animal abuse.
For PETA Gervais voiced a rabbit and Pink (singer) Pink played an alligator in an awareness advertisement.
Gervais named an Asian black bear, also known as a moonbear, Derek after his character Derek Noakes from his series Derek.
In December 2013, Gervais bought a $1000 cake shaped like a moonbear to raise funds for Animal Asia.
Gervais is active in the prevention of illegal wildlife trade; he supported the handing over of ivory trinkets to the Metropolitan police in London.
In 2015, Gervais donated a signed acoustic guitar to help raise funds for Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary in Ontario, Canada, with a special call-out to Pockets Warhol (capuchin monkey) Pockets Warhol.
The guitar which was signed by Gervais was purchased by Danny Young from the United Kingdom who has since had the guitar signed by several celebrities in order to raise further funds for the Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary. Celebrities who signed the guitar include: Brian May, Will Ferrell, Bryan Cranston, Dhani Harrison, Peter Frampton, Ricky Warwick and Steve Cutts.
In 2017, Gervais was awarded the Lord Houghton Award for Service to Animal Welfare from Animal Defenders International.
