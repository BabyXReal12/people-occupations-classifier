===Television===

====Early television appearances====
File:RickyGervaisBAFTA07.jpg thumb upright Gervais at the 60th British Academy Film Awards in 2007
Gervais has contributed to the BAFTA-winning The Sketch Show (ITV), penning several sketches. His mainstream-TV debut came in September 1998 as part of Channel 4s "Comedy Lab" series of pilots. His one-off show Golden Years (TV programme) Golden Years focused on a David Bowie–obsessed character called Clive Meadows.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/the-long-funny-career-of-ricky-gervais-20110404/golden-years-1998-0520409Aa title=The Long, Funny Career of Ricky Gervais work=Rolling Stone first=Tom  last=Eames accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>

Gervais then came to much wider national attention with an obnoxious, cutting persona featured in a topical slot that replaced Ali Gs segments on the satirical Channel 4 comedy programme The 11 OClock Show in early 1999, in which his character used as many Profanity expletives as was possible and produced an inordinate amount of politically incorrect statements. Among the other regular featured comedians on the show was Mackenzie Crook, later a co-star of The Office (UK TV series) The Office. Two years later, Gervais went on to present his own comedy chat show for Channel 4 called Meet Ricky Gervais; it was poorly received and has since been mocked by Gervais himself.

Throughout this time, Gervais also wrote for the BBC sketch show Bruiser (TV series) Bruiser and The Jim Tavare Show.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/ricky_gervais_person_page.shtml title=Comedy People A-Z Ricky Gervais

====The Office====
{{Main The Office (UK TV series)}}
The Office (UK TV series) The Office started when Stephen Merchant, while on a BBC production course, had to make his own short film. In August 1999 he made a docu-soap parody, set in an office, with help from Ash Atalla, who was shown a 7-minute video called The Seedy Boss. Thus David Brent was created. Merchant passed this tape on to the BBCs Head of Entertainment Paul Jackson (producer) Paul Jackson at the Edinburgh Fringe, who then passed it on to Head of Comedy Jon Plowman, who eventually commissioned a full-pilot script from Merchant and Gervais.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.theguardian.com/profiles/story/0,,1250074,.html title=The Guardian profile: Ricky Gervais

A Christmas special of Extras aired on 27 December 2007 in the UK and on 16 December 2007 in the US, featuring guest appearances by George Michael, Clive Owen, Gordon Ramsay, Jonathan Ross and David Tennant.

Gervais was influenced by Curb Your Enthusiasm, in making Extras, particularly in the format of celebrities making fools of themselves or subverting their public personas.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/the-curb-effect-how-larry-david-changed-comedy-forever-20110720/ricky-gervais-0166936 title=Tricky Gervais The Curb Effect How Larry David Changed Comedy Forever  work=Rolling Stone accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>

The Guardian{{}}s Chris Tryhorn explained the "few gripes" he had with Extras, "particularly in the second series". "You can forgive Gervais a certain arrogance after the success of The Office, but..." He remarks on the confused tone of the series, taking in the clash between the broad comedy of characters Barry (Shaun Williamson) and Darren (Stephen Merchant), and the apparent parody of this style with When The Whistle Blows, and "given their total indulgence of Gervais, the BBC is portrayed as interfering, its comedy department run by a rather crudely stereotyped gay couple".<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2006/sep/22/extrasworkneededricky title=Extras work needed, Ricky? first=Chris  last=Tryhorn work=The Guardian accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>
