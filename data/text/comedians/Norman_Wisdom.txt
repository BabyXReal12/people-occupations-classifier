==Early life==
Norman Joseph Wisdom was born in the Marylebone district of London. His parents were Frederick, a chauffeur, and Maud Wisdom (née Targett), a dressmaker who often worked for West End theatres, and had made a dress for Mary of Teck Queen Mary.<ref>Dont Laugh at Me, p. 1</ref> The couple married in Marylebone on 15 July 1912. Wisdom had an elder brother, Frederick Thomas "Fred" Wisdom (13 December 1912 – 1 July 1971).{{citation needed date=December 2017}}

The family lived at 91 Fernhead Road, Maida Vale, London W9, where they slept in one room.<ref name="MyTurn">{{cite book last1=Wisdom  first1=Norman  last2=Hall  first2=William  title= My Turn publisher=Arrow Books year=2003 isbn=978-0-09-944676-7}}</ref> He and his brother were raised in extreme poverty and were frequently hit by their father.<ref name="Story"/>

After a period in a Foster care childrens home in Deal, Kent Deal, Kent, Wisdom ran away when he was 11 but returned to become an errand boy errand boy in a grocery store grocers shop on leaving school at 13. Having been kicked out of his home by his father and become homeless,<ref name="Story">Norman Wisdom: My Story, BBC Two, 15 October 2010</ref> in 1929 he walked (by his own account) to Cardiff, Wales, where he became a cabin boy in the British Merchant Navy Merchant Navy. He later also worked as a coal mining coal miner, waiting staff waiter and Page (occupation) page boy.{{citation needed date=December 2017}}

==In the military and early career as an entertainer==
Wisdom first enlisted into the Kings Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster), but his mother had him discharged as he was under age. He later re-enlisted as a drummer#In the military drummer boy{{citation needed date=December 2017}} in the 10th Royal Hussars of the British Army. In 1930, he was posted to Lucknow, in the United Provinces of British India United Provinces of British Raj British India,<ref name="TelegraphObit"/> as a Military band bandsman. There he gained an education certificate,{{citation needed date=December 2017}} rode horses, became the flyweight boxing champion of the British Indian Army British Army in India<ref name="TelegraphObit"/> and learned to play the trumpet and clarinet.<ref name="MyTurn"/>

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Wisdom was sent to work in a communications centre in a command bunker in London, where he connected telephone calls from war leaders to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom prime minister. He met Winston Churchill on several occasions when asked for updates on incoming calls,<ref name="MyTurn"/> Wisdom then joined the Royal Corps of Signals, and performed a similar military function at the unit headquarters in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

Whilst performing a shadow boxing routine in the army gym, Wisdom discovered he had a talent for entertainment,<ref>{{cite news url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3751896.stm title=Sir Norman takes final stage bow date=18 October 2004 work=BBC News  accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> and began to develop his skills as a musician and performance art stage entertainer.<ref name="BBCFool">{{cite news url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/779888.stm title=Sir Norman: Nobodys fool date=6 June 2000 work=BBC News  accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref> In 1940 aged 25, at a NAAFI entertainment night, during a dance routine, Wisdom stepped down from his position in the orchestra pit, and started shadow boxing. Hearing his colleagues and officers giggling, he broke into a duck waddle, followed by a series of facial expressions. He later described the reaction as: "They were in hysterics. All the officers were falling about laughing."<ref name=GuardWordsWis>{{cite news  url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/25/features.magazine1 title=Words of Wisdom first=Burhan  last=Wazie work=The Observer  date=25 February 2001 accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref>

Wisdom later said this was where he first patented his persona as "The Successful Failure".<ref name=GuardWordsWis/> Over the next few years, until he was demobilized in 1945, his routine included his characteristic singing and the trip-up-and-stumble. After Wisdom appeared at a charity concert at Cheltenham Town Hall, actor Rex Harrison came backstage and urged him to become a professional entertainer.<ref>{{cite news url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/3086186.stm title=Plaque marks comics time in forces date=6 September 2003 work=BBC News  accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref>

After being demobilised in 1946, he worked as a Taxicabs of the United Kingdom private hire car driver. Having improved his diction in the army, he also took a job as a night switchboard operator telephone operator.<ref name="MyTurn"/>

Wisdom made his debut as a professional entertainer at the age of 31; his rise to the top was phenomenally fast. Initially the Double act straight man to the Magic (illusion) magician David Nixon (magician) David Nixon,<ref name="BBCFool"/> he had already adopted the costume that would remain his trademark: tweed flat cap askew, with peak turned up; a suit at least two sizes too tight; a crumpled collar and a mangled tie. The character that went with this costume—known as "the Gump"—was to dominate Wisdoms film career. A West End theatre star within two years, he honed his performance skills mainly between theatres in London and Brighton:<ref name=GuardWordsWis/>
{{quote I spent virtually all of those years on the road. You could keep incredibly busy just performing in pantomimes and revues. There was a whole generation of performers who learned everything on the stage.}}
 
Wisdom made his TV debut in 1948 and was soon commanding enormous audiences and had a small film role in A Date with a Dream released in the same year.

==Starring film roles for the Rank Organisation==
Wisdom made a series of low-budget star-vehicle comedies for the Rank Organisation, beginning with Trouble in Store (1953).<ref>{{cite book last1=McFarlane first1=Brian last2=Slide first2=Anthony title=The Encyclopedia of British Film url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/450916/ accessdate=22 October 2010 year=2003 publisher=Methuen Publishing Ltd location=London, UK  isbn=0-413-77301-9 page=736}}</ref> This film earned him a BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Film in 1954.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1953 title=Film Nominations 1953 publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref> It was the second most popular film at the British box-office in 1954 and exhibitors voted him the tenth biggest star at the British box office the same year.<ref name="Wayne">{{cite news  url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27253063  title=John Wayne Heads Box-Office Poll  newspaper=The Mercury (Hobart) The Mercury  location=Hobart, Tasmania  date=31 December 1954  accessdate=24 April 2012  page=6  via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

They were also successful in some unlikely overseas markets, helping Rank stay afloat financially when their more expensive film projects were unsuccessful.{{citation needed date=December 2017}}

The films usually involved the Gump character, usually called Norman, in a manual occupation in which he is barely competent and in a junior position to a straight man, often played by Edward Chapman (actor) Edward Chapman (as Mr Grimsdale) or Jerry Desmonde. They benefited from Wisdoms capacity for physical slapstick comedy and his skill at creating a sense of the characters helplessness. The series often contained a romantic subplot; the Gumps inevitable awkwardness with women is a characteristic shared with the earlier Formby vehicles. His innocent incompetence still made him endearing to the heroine.

The box office receipts of these last few films had declined from previous Wisdom films but The Square Peg (1959), an army comedy, reversed the trend and was one of the years biggest hits. The film was the 7th most popular movie at the British box office in 1959.<ref>"Year Of Profitable British Films." Times [London, England] 1 January 1960: 13. The Times Digital Archive.

In 1966, Wisdom spent a short period in the United States to star in a Broadway production of the Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn musical comedy Walking Happy. His performance was nominated for a Tony Award.

This led to Wisdoms being cast in his first Hollywood movie, The Night They Raided Minskys (1968). Back in England he tried to change his image slightly in Whats Good for the Goose (1969), which featured a topless scene, but it was financially unsuccessful.

Wisdom was one of several actors initially considered for the role of Frank Spencer in Some Mothers Do Ave Em, however he turned the role down and it eventually went to Michael Crawford. The creator of the series Raymond Allen (scriptwriter) Raymond Allen later stated "Norman Wisdom was offered the role but turned it down because he didnt find it funny".<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/646955/Frank-Spencer-Raymond-Allen-sports-relief-some-mothers-do-ave-em title=The man who made Frank Spencer first=Peter last=Robertson date=24 February 2016 newspaper=Daily Express  accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>

He won critical acclaim in 1981 for his dramatic role of a dying cancer patient in the television play Going Gently.

After touring South Africa and Australia with some success, his appearances in Britain became more infrequent.

===Popularity in Albania===
Wisdom was a well-known performer in Albania, where he was one of the few Western actors whose films were allowed in the country during the dictatorship of Enver Hoxha. From Hoxhas misconceived view, proletarian Normans ultimately victorious struggles against capitalism, personified by Mr Grimsdale and the effete aristocratic characters played by Jerry Desmonde, were a Communist parable on the class war. He was known as "Mr Pitkin" after the character from his films. In 1995, he visited the post-Joseph Stalin Stalinist country where, to his surprise, he was greeted by many appreciative fans, including the then President, Sali Berisha. During this trip, Wisdom was filmed by Newsnight as he visited a childrens project funded by ChildHope UK.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/9063102.stm title=Norman Wisdom mobbed by Albanian fans on 1995 trip  date=5 October 2010  work=Newsnight  publisher=BBC  accessdate=11 October 2010}}</ref>
