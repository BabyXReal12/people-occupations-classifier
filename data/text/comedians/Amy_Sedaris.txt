At age 16, Sedaris worked at her local Winn-Dixie supermarket.

Later, as a cocktail waitress at Zanies Comedy Club in Chicago, Illinois, she was fired for being five minutes late. She took her revenge on her boss: "I took his keys, and I threw them in the snow. I heard he found them in the spring."<ref>{{YouTube id=kIkP89QF7_A title=Amy Sedaris – The Best and the Brightest *Interview (June 21/11)}}</ref> According to David Sedaris book Me Talk Pretty One Day, Amy was a very dramatic child and would often assume characters to play pranks on her family.
