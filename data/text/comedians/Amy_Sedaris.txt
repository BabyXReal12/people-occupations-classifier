Amy Louise Sedaris ({{IPAc-en s ɪ ˈ d ɛər ɪ s}};
born March 29, 1961) is an American actress, comedian and writer known for playing Jerri Blank in the Comedy Central television series Strangers with Candy. She regularly collaborates with her older brother David Sedaris David, a humorist and author. Since 2014, Sedaris has voiced the character Princess Carolyn in the Netflix animated series BoJack Horseman.

==Early life==
Sedaris was born in Endicott, New York, the daughter of Sharon Elizabeth (née Leonard) and Louis Harry "Lou" Sedaris,
and grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, with her siblings, Lisa, David Sedaris David, Gretchen, Tiffany, and Paul. Her father is of Greek American Greek descent and her mother was an English American Anglo-American.
Her father is Greek Orthodox Church Greek Orthodox, and her mother was a Protestantism Protestant. She was raised in her fathers Orthodox faith.
At age 16, Sedaris worked at her local Winn-Dixie supermarket. She would make fake announcements over the loudspeaker, prompting the head cashier to confiscate the microphone and threaten to fire her. After work, she egged the cashiers car in protest. Later, as a cocktail waitress at Zanies Comedy Club in Chicago, Illinois, she was fired for being five minutes late. She took her revenge on her boss: "I took his keys, and I threw them in the snow. I heard he found them in the spring."
According to David Sedaris book Me Talk Pretty One Day, Amy was a very dramatic child and would often assume characters to play pranks on her family.
