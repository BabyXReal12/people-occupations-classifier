==A Beginners Guide to Acting English==
The book describes the way in which Khorsandi experienced England as a young girl. The narrative begins with her attending nursery school, The Kings International Nursery School, with her brother, Peyvand. Throughout the book, she explains the ways in which the Persian language differs from English: "They called me ‘poppet’. Iranians said jaan or azizam." She also expresses pride in how her father took English classes and was praised for his affinity with the written word, though she also felt he was able to be more humorous in Persian language Persian.

Other themes include her experiences with English food and customs, the war between Iran and Iraq, and the hostilities that she and her family encounter—she notes, for example, having been referred to as a terrorist.
