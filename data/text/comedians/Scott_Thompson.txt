==Firebombing==
In 2000, Thompson was living with then-boyfriend French documentarian Joel Soler in Hollywood. Soler had smuggled footage out of Iraq to make an E! E! News-style satiric political documentary comedy, Uncle Saddam, about the strange eccentricities in the home life of Saddam Hussein and his family which bubbled behind Hussein’s dictatorial façade. Thompson wrote the narration for the movie, which was read by actor Wallace Langham. Following the movie, Thompson and Solers home was under surveillance by a terrorist group in West Hollywood, who eventually firebombed the couple on November 1, 2000. Thompson has discussed this incident in interviews with Jesse Brown (journalist) Jesse Brown of CANADALAND and fellow Canadian comic Elvira Kurt as being inspiration for his future show The Lowest Show on Earth. In the interview with Kurt, he says of the attack, "We were sleeping and a group came to our home. They filled our giant garbage cans with gasoline and set them on fire on our front lawn. They had buckets of red paint. They covered the house with it so it dripped off like blood. They put a note in the front hall that said, "In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate, burn this Satanic film or you will be dead." They underlined "dead" just in case we werent freaked out enough."<ref>{{cite web last1=Kurt first1=Elvira title=Scott Thompson on how terror helped him to love his gift url=http://www.dailyxtra.com/canada/arts-and-entertainment/scott-thompson-terror-helped-love-gift-52874 website=DailyXtra publisher=DailyXtra accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref>

This, along with many other incidents throughout Thompsons life, including the 1975 Centennial Secondary School shooting at his Brampton high school, led him to process incidents of terror on micro- and macrocosmic levels through his one-man comedy show The Lowest Show on Earth. Thompson went on tour with this show and secured a spot in New York off-Broadway. The posters—featuring Thompson lying Supine position supine on the ground with a big wad of semen dripping down the side of his face—went up around the city on September 10, 2001. The following day, the horror of September 11 attacks September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center made the one-man show’s difficult material completely impossible to talk about.<ref>{{cite web last1=Brown first1=Jesse title=Scott Thompson: Veteran comedian Scott Thompson on why nothing happened after The Kids In The Hall, the biggest problems with the Canadian film & TV industry, and why gay men still have to be defanged to be accepted. url=http://www.canadalandshow.com/podcast/scott-thompson/ website=CANADALAND publisher=CANADALAND accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref>
