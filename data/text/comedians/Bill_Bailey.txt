At about the age of 15, he started to become distracted from school work when he realised the thrill of performance as a member of a school band called Behind Closed Doors, which played mostly original work. He was the only pupil at his school to study GCE Advanced Level A-level music and he passed with an A grade. He also claims to have been good at sport (captain of KES 2nd XI cricket team 1982), which often surprised his teachers. He would often combine music and sport by leading the singing on the long coach trip back from away rugby fixtures. It was here that he was given his nickname Bill by his music teacher, Ian Phipps, for being able to play the song "Wont You Come Home Bill Bailey" so well on the guitar.<ref name="DID BB"/>

He started studies for an English degree at Westfield College of the University of London but left after a year.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/bill-bailey-people-are-obsessed-by-how-i-look-1027334.html "People are obsessed by how I look"], The Independent, 21 November 2008.</ref> He is a classically trained musician and received an Associateship Diploma from the London College of Music as well as being made an honorary member of the Society of Crematorium Organists.

Bailey often mythologises his early years in his stand-up. In his show Bewilderness, he claims to have attended Bovington Gurney School of Performing Arts and Owl Sanctuary. He talks about a succession of jobs he had before becoming a comedian, including lounge pianist, crematorium organist, door-to-door door-salesman and accompanist for a mind-reading dog on the Childrens TV show Motormouth. A clip of Baileys appearance in the dogs routine was shown during his Room 101 (TV series) Room 101 appearance.

Bailey also talks about his role as a "Disenfranchised Owl" in an experimental Welsh theatre troupe.<ref>{{cite news last=Ross first=Deborah title=Bill Bailey: The laid-back stand-up guy url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/bill-bailey-the-laidback-standup-guy-613425.html accessdate=1 September 2011 newspaper=The Independent date=7 October 2002}}</ref> Other acting roles included a part in a Workers Revolutionary Party (UK) Workers Revolutionary Party stage production called The Printers, which also featured Vanessa Redgrave and Frances de la Tour.

==Career==

===Early stand-up===
Bailey began touring the country with comedians such as Mark Lamarr. In 1984, he formed a double act, the Rubber Bishops, with Toby Longworth (a fellow former pupil at King Edwards, Bath). It was there that Bailey began developing his own style, mixing in musical parody parodies with deconstructions of or variations on traditional jokes ("How many Amoeba (genus) amoebas does it take to change a lightbulb? One, no two! No four! No eight..."). According to comedy folklore, after a reviewer once criticised his act for its lack of jokes, Bailey returned the following night, at Queen Margaret University Queen Margaret College, Edinburgh, to perform a set composed entirely of punchlines. Longworth left to join the RSC in 1989 and was replaced by Martin Stubbs.

Stubbs later quit to pursue a more serious career, and in 1994 Bailey performed Rock at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with Sean Lock, a show about an ageing rockstar and his Road crew roadie, script-edited by comedy writer Jim Miller. It was later serialised for the Mark Radcliffe show on BBC Radio 1. The shows attendances were not impressive and on one occasion the only person in the audience was comedian Dominic Holland. Bailey almost gave up comedy to take up a telesales job.<ref>{{cite news  url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/bill-bailey-for-whom-the-bill-toils-6157771.html location=London work=The Independent title=Bill Bailey: For whom the Bill toils date=18 November 2004}}</ref>

He went solo the next year with the one man show Bill Baileys Cosmic Jam. The show led to a recording at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London which was broadcast in 1997 on Channel 4 as a one-hour special called Bill Bailey Live. It was not until 2005 that this was released on DVD uncut and under its original title. It marked the first time that Bailey had been able to tie together his music and Postmodernism post-modern joke gags with the whimsical rambling style he is now known for.

After supporting Donna McPhail in 1995 and winning a Time Out (company) Time Out award, he returned to Edinburgh in 1996 with a show that was nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Awards Perrier Comedy Award. Amongst the other nominees was future Black Books co-star Dylan Moran, who narrowly beat him in the closest vote in the awards history.

Bailey won the Best Live Stand-Up award at the British Comedy Awards in 1999.

===Television===
Though he did not win the Edinburgh Comedy Awards Perrier in 1996, the nomination was enough to get him noticed, and in 1998 the BBC gave him his own television show, Is It Bill Bailey?

This was not Baileys first foray into television. His debut was on the childrens TV show Motormouth in the late 1980s&nbsp;– playing piano for a mind-reading dog. Bailey reminisced about the experience on the BBC show Room 101 (TV series) Room 101 with Paul Merton in 2000. In 1991, he was appearing in stand-up shows such as The Happening, Packing Them In, The Stand Up Show and The Comedy Store. He also appeared as captain on two panel games, an ITV (TV network) ITV music quiz pilot called Pop Dogs, and the Channel 4 science fiction quiz show Space Cadets (game show) Space Cadets. Is it Bill Bailey? was the first time he had written and presented his own show.

Over the next few years, Bailey made guest appearances on shows such as Have I Got News for You, World Cup Comedy, Room 101 (TV series) Room 101, Des OConnor Tonight, Coast to Coast and three episodes of off-beat Channel 4 sitcom Spaced, in which he played comic-shop manager Bilbo Bagshot.

In 1998, Dylan Moran approached him with the pilot script for Black Books, a Channel 4 sitcom about a cold-hearted bookshop owner, his nice-guy assistant, and their socially awkward female friend. It was commissioned in 2000, and Bailey took the part of the assistant Manny Bianco, with Moran playing the owner Bernard and Tamsin Greig the friend, Fran. Three series of six episodes each were made.

When Sean Hughes (comedian) Sean Hughes left his long-term role as a team captain on Never Mind the Buzzcocks in 2002, Bailey became his successor. His style quickly blended into the show, possibly helped by his background in music. He soon developed a rapport with host Mark Lamarr, who continually teased him about his looks and his pre-occupation with woodland animals. It was announced on 18 September 2008 that Bailey would leave the series and be replaced by a series of guest captains including Jack Dee and Dermot OLeary.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7623854.stm work=BBC News title=Bailey says goodbye to Buzzcocks date=18 September 2008 accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref> While touring in 2009, Bailey joked that the main reason for leaving the show was a lack of desire to continue humming Britney Spears Toxic (song) Toxic to little known figures in the Independent music indie music scene. During this time he also left his position as "curator" of the Museum of Curiosity, and declared his intention to "retire" from panel games, although he has since appeared on QI many more times and hosted Have I Got News For You.

Bailey has appeared frequently on the intellectual panel game QI since it began in 2003, alongside host Stephen Fry and regular panellist Alan Davies; he was also the winner of the shows unaired pilot episode. Other television appearances include a cameo role in Alan Davies drama series Jonathan Creek as failing street Magic (illusion) magician Kenny Starkiss and obsessed guitar teacher in the "Holiday" episode of Sean Locks 15 Storeys High Fifteen Storeys High. He later appeared with Lock again as a guest on his show TV Heaven, Telly Hell. He has also appeared twice on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross. Bailey also hosted his own show Comics Choice, which aired in 2011.

Bailey also presented Wild Thing I Love You which began on Channel 4 on 15 October 2006. The series concentrates on the protection of Britains wild animals, and has included re-homing badgers, owls and European Water Vole water voles.

Bailey appeared in the second series of the E4 teenage "dramedy" Skins (UK TV series) Skins playing Maxxies dad, Walter Oliver. In episode 1, Walter struggles with his sons desire to be a dancer, instead wishing him to become a builder, which is what he himself does for a living. Walter is married to Jackie, played by Fiona Allen.

Bailey appeared on the first episode of Grand Designs Grand Designs Live on 4 May 2008, helping Kevin McCloud build his eco-friendly home. In 2009, Bailey appeared in the BBC show Hustle (TV series) Hustle as the character "Cyclops", a side-line character. In autumn 2009, Bailey presented Bill Baileys Birdwatching Bonanza.<ref>{{cite web title=Bill Baileys Birdwatching Bonanza url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1582688/ publisher=Internet Movie database accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref>

In 2001, Bailey began touring the globe with Bewilderness. A recording of a performance in Swansea was released on DVD the same year, and the show was broadcast on Channel 4 that Christmas. A modified version of it also proved successful in America, and in 2002 Bailey released a CD of a recording at the WestBeth Theatre in New York City. The show contained his popular music parodies (such as Unisex Chip Shop, a Billy Bragg tribute, which he also performed with Bragg himself at the 2005 Glastonbury Festival), "three men in a pub" jokes (including one in the style of Geoffrey Chaucer) and deconstructions of television themes such as Countdown (game show) Countdown and The Magic Roundabout. A Bewilderness CD was sold outside gigs, a mixture of studio recordings of songs and monologues Bailey had performed in the past&nbsp;– it was later released in shops as Bill Bailey: The Ultimate Collection... Ever!  That same year he also presented a Channel 4 countdown, Top Ten Prog Rock.

Bailey premiered his show Part Troll at the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. A critical and commercial success, he then transferred it to the West End, where tickets sold out in under 24 hours, and new dates had to be added. He continued to tour it all over the UK as well as in the US, Australia and New Zealand. Bailey expanded on subjects such as the Iraq War war on Iraq. He also talks extensively about drugs, at one point asking the audience to name different ways of baking Cannabis (drug) cannabis. A DVD was released in 2004.

The petition reached its goal in the early days of January, and was sent to the producers. It was hoped that as the Tinselworm tour took him to Wellington in New Zealand where the film was in pre-production, that he would be able to audition.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.wiredmag.co.uk/archive-feature.php?issue_id=50&feature_id=69  title=All That Glitters  accessdate=31 December 2007  work=Wired, Croydons listings magazine  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104022358/http://www.wiredmag.co.uk/archive-feature.php?issue_id=50  archivedate= 4 January 2008  df= }}</ref>
