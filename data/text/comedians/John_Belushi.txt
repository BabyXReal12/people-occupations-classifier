John Adam Belushi (January 24, 1949 – March 5, 1982) was an American comedian, actor, and singer. Belushi is best known for his "intense energy and raucous attitude"
which he displayed as one of the seven Saturday Night Live cast members original cast members of the NBC sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL). Throughout his career, Belushi had a close personal and artistic partnership with his fellow SNL star Dan Aykroyd, whom he met while they were both working at Chicagos The Second City comedy club.
Born in Chicago to Albanian American parents, Belushi started his own comedy troupe with Tino Insana and Steve Beshekas, called "The West Compass Trio", which was met with success. Belushi was offered a chance to perform with The Second City after being discovered by Bernard Sahlins. There, he met Brian Doyle-Murray and Harold Ramis. He also met Aykroyd, who would later become one of his close associates.

In 1975, Belushi was recommended to SNL creator/showrunner Lorne Michaels by Chevy Chase and Michael ODonoghue, who accepted Belushi as a new cast member of the show after an audition. He developed a series of characters on the show that reached high success, including his notable performances such as Henry Kissinger and Ludwig van Beethoven. After his breakout and best-known film role as John "Bluto" Blutarsky, the lead in Animal House National Lampoons Animal House (1978), Belushi later took an interest in films such as 1941 (film) 1941, The Blues Brothers (film) The Blues Brothers, and Neighbors (1981 film) Neighbors. He also pursued interests in music, creating with Aykroyd, Lou Marini, Tom Malone (musician) Tom Malone, Steve Cropper, Donald "Duck" Dunn, and Paul Shaffer, the Blues Brothers, from which the film received its name.

In his personal life, Belushi struggled with heavy drug use that affected his comedy career, and was dismissed and rehired by Michaels on several occasions due to his behavior. In 1982, Belushi died from combined drug intoxication caused by an injection of a heroin and cocaine mixture, known as a Speedball (drug) speedball. He was posthumously honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004.

==Early life==
Belushis mother, Agnes Demetri (Samaras), was the daughter of Albanians Albanian immigrants, and his father, Adam Anastos Belushi, was an Albanian emigrant from Qytezë.

==Career==

===The Second City and National Lampoon===
<!-- Deleted image removed: File:John at Second City in Chicago, 1971.jpg thumb right Belushi at Second City in Chicago, 1971 -->
Belushi started his own comedy troupe in Chicago, The West Compass Trio (named after the improvisational cabaret revue Compass Players active from 1955–1958 in Chicago), with Tino Insana and Steve Beshekas. Their success piqued the interest of Bernard Sahlins, the founder of The Second City improvised comedy enterprise, who went to see them performing in 1971 and immediately asked Belushi to join the cast.
At Second City, he met and began working with Harold Ramis and Brian Doyle-Murray.
In 1972 Belushi was offered a role, together with Chevy Chase and Christopher Guest, in National Lampoon Lemmings,
a parody of Woodstock, which played Off-Broadway off Broadway in 1972. Belushi and Jacklin moved to New York City. Belushi started working as a writer, director and actor for  The National Lampoon Radio Hour, a comedy radio show which was created, produced and written by staff from National Lampoon magazine National Lampoon magazine.
During a trip to Toronto to check out the local Second City cast in 1974, he met Dan Aykroyd.
Jacklin became an associate producer for the show, and she and Belushi were married on December 31, 1976.

===Saturday Night Live===
In 1975 Chevy Chase and writer Michael ODonoghue recommended Belushi to Lorne Michaels as a potential member for a television show Michaels was about to produce called Saturday Night a.k.a. Saturday Night Live (SNL). Michaels was initially undecided, as he was not sure if Belushis physical humor would fit with what he was envisioning, but he changed his mind after giving Belushi an audition.
Over his four-year tenure at SNL, Belushi developed a series of successful characters, including the belligerent Saturday Night Live Samurai Samurai Futaba, Henry Kissinger, Ludwig van Beethoven, the Greek owner of the Olympia Café, Captain James T. Kirk, and a contributor of furious opinion pieces on Weekend Update, during which he coined his catchphrase, "But N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!"
With Aykroyd, Belushi created Jake and Elwood, the Blues Brothers. Originally intended to warm up the crowd before the show, the Blues Brothers were eventually featured as music guests.
Belushi also reprised his Lemmings imitation of Joe Cocker. Cocker himself joined Belushi in 1976 to sing Feelin Alright? Feeling Alright together.

Like many of his fellow SNL cast members, Belushi began experimenting heavily with drugs to deal with the constant pressure. His unpredictable temper caused him to be fired (and immediately re-hired) by Michaels a number of times.
In Rolling Stone{{}}s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 SNL cast members to that time, Belushi received the top ranking.  "Belushi was the live in Saturday Night Live", they wrote, "the one who made the show happen on the edge ... Nobody embodied the highs and lows of SNL like Belushi."
===Expansion into films===
In 1978, he performed in the films Old Boyfriends (directed by Joan Tewkesbury), Goin South (directed by Jack Nicholson), and Animal House (directed by John Landis). Upon its initial release, Animal House received generally mixed reviews from critics, but Time (magazine) Time and Roger Ebert proclaimed it one of the years best. Filmed for $2.8 million, it is one of the most profitable movies of all time, garnering an estimated gross of more than $141 million in the form of theatrical rentals and home video, not including merchandising. Animal House was also largely responsible for defining and launching the Gross out gross-out genre of films, which became one of Hollywoods staples.
Following the success of The Blues Brothers on SNL, Belushi and Aykroyd, with the help of pianist-arranger Paul Shaffer, started assembling studio talents to form a proper band. These included SNL saxophonist "Blue" Lou Marini and trombonist-saxophonist Tom Malone (musician) Tom Malone, who had previously played in Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears. At Shaffers suggestion, guitarist Steve Cropper and bassist Donald "Duck" Dunn, the powerhouse combo from Booker T and the M.G.s and subsequently almost every hit out of Memphiss Stax Records during the 1960s, were signed as well.
In 1978 The Blues Brothers released their debut album, Briefcase Full of Blues, with Atlantic Records. The album reached #1 on the Billboard 200 and went double platinum. Two singles were released, "Rubber Biscuit", which reached number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 and "Soul Man", which reached number 14.

In 1979, Belushi left Saturday Night Live with Aykroyd to pursue a film career.  They made three movies together, 1941 (film) 1941 (directed by Steven Spielberg), Neighbors (1981 film) Neighbors (directed by John Avildsen), and most notably The Blues Brothers (film) The Blues Brothers (directed by John Landis). Released in the United States on June 20, 1980, The Blues Brothers received generally positive reviews. It earned just under $5 million in its opening weekend and went on to gross $115.2 million in theaters worldwide before its release on home video. The Blues Brothers band toured to promote the film, which led to a third album (and second live album), Made in America (The Blues Brothers album) Made in America, recorded at the Universal Amphitheatre in 1980. The track "Whos Making Love" peaked at No 39.

The only film Belushi made without Aykroyd following his departure from SNL was the romantic comedy Continental Divide (film) Continental Divide (directed by Michael Apted). Released in September 1981, it starred Belushi as Chicago home town hero writer Ernie Souchack (loosely based on newspaper columnist and long-time family friend Mike Royko), who gets an assignment researching a scientist (played by Blair Brown) who studies birds of prey in the remote Rocky Mountains.

By 1980, Belushi had become a fan and advocate of the punk rock band Fear (band) Fear after seeing them perform in several after-hours New York City bars, and brought them to Cherokee Studios to record songs for the soundtrack of  Neighbors (1981 film) Neighbors. Blues Brother band member and sax player Tom Scott (musician) Tom Scott, along with producing partner and Cherokee owner Bruce Robb, initially helped with the session but later pulled out due to conflicts with Belushi. The session was eventually produced by Steve Cropper.

At the time of his death, Belushi was pursuing several movie projects,
including Moon Over Miami with Louis Malle, National Lampoons The Joy of Sex with Penny Marshall, and Noble Rot with Jay Sandrich, based on a script he adapted and rewrote with former SNL writer Don Novello. He was also scheduled to work with Aykroyd on Ghostbusters and Spies Like Us.

Belushi also made a "Guest Star Appearance" on an episode of the television series Police Squad! (1982), which showed him underwater wearing cement shoes. He died shortly before the episode aired, so the scene was cut and replaced by a segment with William Conrad.
==Death==
The day before Belushis death, he visited his longtime manager Bernie Brillstein and asked for cash. Brillstein said no, suspecting Belushi wanted money for drugs.
Later in the day, when Brillstein had another visitor, Belushi returned and again asked for money. Brillstein complied, reluctant to rebuke Belushi in front of another person. 

On March 5, 1982, arriving for a scheduled workout, Belushis trainer Bill Wallace (martial arts) Bill Wallace found him dead in Bungalow 3 at the Chateau Marmont Hotel on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood.
He was 33 years old.
The cause of death was combined drug intoxication involving cocaine and heroin, a drug combination known as a Speedball (drug) speedball. In the early morning hours on the day of his death, he was visited separately by friends Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, as well as Cathy Smith Catherine Evelyn Smith.
His death was investigated by forensic pathology forensic pathologist Michael Baden,
among others, and, while the findings were disputed, it was officially ruled a drug-related accident. 

Two months later, Smith admitted in an interview with the National Enquirer that she had been with Belushi the night of his death and had given him the fatal speedball shot. After the appearance of the article "I Killed Belushi" in the Enquirer edition of June 29, 1982, the case was reopened. Smith was extradited from Ontario, Canada, arrested, and charged with Murder (United States law)#Degrees first-degree murder. A plea bargain reduced the charge to involuntary manslaughter, and she served 15 months in prison.
Belushis wife arranged for a traditional Eastern Orthodox Orthodox Christian funeral which was conducted by an Albanian Orthodox priest.  He has been interred twice at Abels Hill Cemetery in Chilmark, Massachusetts on Marthas Vineyard. A tombstone marking the original burial location has a skull and crossbones with the inscription, "I may be gone but Rock and Roll lives on."
His name is included on the Belushi family stone marking his mothers grave at Elmwood Cemetery (River Grove, Illinois) Elmwood Cemetery in River Grove, Illinois. This stone reads, "He gave us laughter."
==Tributes, legacy, and popular culture==
Belushis life was detailed in the 1984 biography Wired (book) Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi by Bob Woodward and 1990s Samurai Widow by his wife Judith.

The thrash metal group Anthrax (American band) Anthrax penned a song about Belushi on their 1987 album Among the Living, titled "Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)."

According to his SNL fellow, Jane Curtin, who appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2011, Belushi was a misogynist who would deliberately sabotage the work of women writers and comics while working on SNL. "So youd go to a table read, and if a woman writer had written a piece for John, he would not read it in his full voice. He felt as though it was his duty to sabotage pieces written by women."
During the pre-production of Ghostbusters, Ivan Reitman remarked Slimer was sort of like Bluto in the film Animal House, like the ghost of John Belushi.
Since then, Slimer has been described as "The Ghost of John Belushi" by Dan Aykroyd in many interviews.

At the conclusion of the very first live Saturday Night Live (season 7) SNL episode (Robert Urich/Mink DeVille on March 20, 1982) two weeks after Belushis death, Brian Doyle-Murray gave a tribute to him.
The American Broadcasting Company ABC Networks similar sketch comedy series Fridays (TV series) Fridays aired a live episode the night of Belushis death. Just before the final credits rolled cast member Maryedith Burrell paid tribute to him by saying, "Were all going to miss John Belushi".

Belushi was scheduled to present the first annual Best Visual Effects Oscar at the 54th Academy Awards 1982 Academy Awards with Dan Aykroyd. Aykroyd presented the award alone, and stated from the lectern: "My partner would have loved to have been here tonight to present this award, since he was a bit of a Visual Effect himself."

In 2017, the TV series Preacher (TV series) Preacher referenced Belushi as having been assassinated as a false prophet.
