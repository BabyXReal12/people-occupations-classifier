Throughout his career, Belushi had a close personal and artistic partnership with his fellow SNL star Dan Aykroyd, whom he met while they were both working at Chicagos The Second City comedy club.<ref name="Sellers2010">{{cite book last=Sellers first=Robert title=An A-Z of Hellraisers: A Comprehensive Compendium of Outrageous Insobriety url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbpGJnRyY3gC&pg=PT53 accessdate=September 10, 2014 date=May 20, 2010 publisher=Random House isbn=9781409051008 pages=53–}}</ref>

Born in Chicago to Albanian American parents, Belushi started his own comedy troupe with Tino Insana and Steve Beshekas, called "The West Compass Trio", which was met with success. Belushi was offered a chance to perform with The Second City after being discovered by Bernard Sahlins. There, he met Brian Doyle-Murray and Harold Ramis. He also met Aykroyd, who would later become one of his close associates.

In 1975, Belushi was recommended to SNL creator/showrunner Lorne Michaels by Chevy Chase and Michael ODonoghue, who accepted Belushi as a new cast member of the show after an audition. He developed a series of characters on the show that reached high success, including his notable performances such as Henry Kissinger and Ludwig van Beethoven. After his breakout and best-known film role as John "Bluto" Blutarsky, the lead in Animal House National Lampoons Animal House (1978), Belushi later took an interest in films such as 1941 (film) 1941, The Blues Brothers (film) The Blues Brothers, and Neighbors (1981 film) Neighbors. He also pursued interests in music, creating with Aykroyd, Lou Marini, Tom Malone (musician) Tom Malone, Steve Cropper, Donald "Duck" Dunn, and Paul Shaffer, the Blues Brothers, from which the film received its name.

In his personal life, Belushi struggled with heavy drug use that affected his comedy career, and was dismissed and rehired by Michaels on several occasions due to his behavior. In 1982, Belushi died from combined drug intoxication caused by an injection of a heroin and cocaine mixture, known as a Speedball (drug) speedball. He was posthumously honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004.

The record was not successful, and the band broke up when he enrolled at the College of DuPage.

==Career==

===The Second City and National Lampoon===
<!-- Deleted image removed: File:John at Second City in Chicago, 1971.jpg thumb right Belushi at Second City in Chicago, 1971 -->
Belushi started his own comedy troupe in Chicago, The West Compass Trio (named after the improvisational cabaret revue Compass Players active from 1955–1958 in Chicago), with Tino Insana and Steve Beshekas. Their success piqued the interest of Bernard Sahlins, the founder of The Second City improvised comedy enterprise, who went to see them performing in 1971 and immediately asked Belushi to join the cast.<ref name="Sellers2010"/> At Second City, he met and began working with Harold Ramis and Brian Doyle-Murray.<ref name="Sellers2010"/> 

In 1972 Belushi was offered a role, together with Chevy Chase and Christopher Guest, in National Lampoon Lemmings,<ref name="BrowneBrowne2001"/> a parody of Woodstock, which played Off-Broadway off Broadway in 1972. Belushi and Jacklin moved to New York City. Belushi started working as a writer, director and actor for  The National Lampoon Radio Hour, a comedy radio show which was created, produced and written by staff from National Lampoon magazine National Lampoon magazine.<ref name=NPR>{{cite web work=NPR title=The National Lampoon Radio Hour date=November 17, 2003 url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1505048}}</ref> During a trip to Toronto to check out the local Second City cast in 1974, he met Dan Aykroyd.<ref name="BrowneBrowne2001"/> Jacklin became an associate producer for the show, and she and Belushi were married on December 31, 1976.

===Saturday Night Live===
In 1975 Chevy Chase and writer Michael ODonoghue recommended Belushi to Lorne Michaels as a potential member for a television show Michaels was about to produce called Saturday Night a.k.a. Saturday Night Live (SNL). Michaels was initially undecided, as he was not sure if Belushis physical humor would fit with what he was envisioning, but he changed his mind after giving Belushi an audition.<ref name="BrowneBrowne2001"/> 

Over his four-year tenure at SNL, Belushi developed a series of successful characters, including the belligerent Saturday Night Live Samurai Samurai Futaba, Henry Kissinger, Ludwig van Beethoven, the Greek owner of the Olympia Café, Captain James T. Kirk, and a contributor of furious opinion pieces on Weekend Update, during which he coined his catchphrase, "But N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!"<ref name="BrowneBrowne2001"/> With Aykroyd, Belushi created Jake and Elwood, the Blues Brothers. Originally intended to warm up the crowd before the show, the Blues Brothers were eventually featured as music guests.<ref name="Epstein2004">{{cite book last=Epstein first= Lawrence Jeffrey title= Mixed Nuts: Americas Love Affair with Comedy Teams : from Burns and Allen to Belushi and Aykroyd url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8g6YQTuBYQ8C&pg=PA223 accessdate=September 10, 2014 year=2004 publisher= PublicAffairs  isbn=9781586481902 pages= 223–}}</ref> Belushi also reprised his Lemmings imitation of Joe Cocker. Cocker himself joined Belushi in 1976 to sing Feelin Alright? Feeling Alright together.

Like many of his fellow SNL cast members, Belushi began experimenting heavily with drugs to deal with the constant pressure. His unpredictable temper caused him to be fired (and immediately re-hired) by Michaels a number of times.<ref name="Parish2011">{{cite book last=Parish first= James Robert title=The Hollywood Book of Extravagance: The Totally Infamous, Mostly Disastrous, and Always Compelling Excesses of Americas Film and TV Idols url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJS5RL7eqdsC&pg=PA102 accessdate=September 10, 2014 date=January 6, 2011  publisher= John Wiley & Sons isbn= 9781118039021 pages=102–}}</ref>  In Rolling Stone{{}}s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 SNL cast members to that time, Belushi received the top ranking.

===Expansion into films===
In 1978, he performed in the films Old Boyfriends (directed by Joan Tewkesbury), Goin South (directed by Jack Nicholson), and Animal House (directed by John Landis). Upon its initial release, Animal House received generally mixed reviews from critics, but Time (magazine) Time and Roger Ebert proclaimed it one of the years best. Filmed for $2.8 million, it is one of the most profitable movies of all time, garnering an estimated gross of more than $141 million in the form of theatrical rentals and home video, not including merchandising. Animal House was also largely responsible for defining and launching the Gross out gross-out genre of films, which became one of Hollywoods staples.<ref>http://www.animalhouse.com</ref>

Following the success of The Blues Brothers on SNL, Belushi and Aykroyd, with the help of pianist-arranger Paul Shaffer, started assembling studio talents to form a proper band. These included SNL saxophonist "Blue" Lou Marini and trombonist-saxophonist Tom Malone (musician) Tom Malone, who had previously played in Blood, Sweat & Tears. At Shaffers suggestion, guitarist Steve Cropper and bassist Donald "Duck" Dunn, the powerhouse combo from Booker T and the M.G.s and subsequently almost every hit out of Memphiss Stax Records during the 1960s, were signed as well.<ref>In his biography of Belushi, Wired (book) Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi, Bob Woodward learned, from the numerous interviews he conducted, that Belushi recruited Cropper and Dunn by "alternating good-natured jokes and hard sell."</ref> In 1978 The Blues Brothers released their debut album, Briefcase Full of Blues, with Atlantic Records. The album reached #1 on the Billboard 200 and went double platinum. Two singles were released, "Rubber Biscuit", which reached number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 and "Soul Man", which reached number 14.

In 1979, Belushi left Saturday Night Live with Aykroyd to pursue a film career.  They made three movies together, 1941 (film) 1941 (directed by Steven Spielberg), Neighbors (1981 film) Neighbors (directed by John Avildsen), and most notably The Blues Brothers (film) The Blues Brothers (directed by John Landis). Released in the United States on June 20, 1980, The Blues Brothers received generally positive reviews. It earned just under $5 million in its opening weekend and went on to gross $115.2 million in theaters worldwide before its release on home video. The Blues Brothers band toured to promote the film, which led to a third album (and second live album), Made in America (The Blues Brothers album) Made in America, recorded at the Universal Amphitheatre in 1980. The track "Whos Making Love" peaked at No 39.

The only film Belushi made without Aykroyd following his departure from SNL was the romantic comedy Continental Divide (film) Continental Divide (directed by Michael Apted). Released in September 1981, it starred Belushi as Chicago home town hero writer Ernie Souchack (loosely based on newspaper columnist and long-time family friend Mike Royko), who gets an assignment researching a scientist (played by Blair Brown) who studies birds of prey in the remote Rocky Mountains.

By 1980, Belushi had become a fan and advocate of the punk rock band Fear (band) Fear after seeing them perform in several after-hours New York City bars, and brought them to Cherokee Studios to record songs for the soundtrack of  Neighbors (1981 film) Neighbors. Blues Brother band member and sax player Tom Scott (musician) Tom Scott, along with producing partner and Cherokee owner Bruce Robb, initially helped with the session but later pulled out due to conflicts with Belushi. The session was eventually produced by Steve Cropper.

At the time of his death, Belushi was pursuing several movie projects,<ref>{{cite web  url=http://splitsider.com/2011/03/the-lost-roles-of-john-belushi/ title=The Lost Roles of John Belushi last1=Evans first1=Bradford last2=  first2=  date=March 3, 2011 website=Splitsider publisher=  accessdate=}}</ref> including Moon Over Miami with Louis Malle, National Lampoons The Joy of Sex with Penny Marshall, and Noble Rot with Jay Sandrich, based on a script he adapted and rewrote with former SNL writer Don Novello. He was also scheduled to work with Aykroyd on Ghostbusters and Spies Like Us.

Belushi also made a "Guest Star Appearance" on an episode of the television series Police Squad! (1982), which showed him underwater wearing cement shoes. He died shortly before the episode aired, so the scene was cut and replaced by a segment with William Conrad.<ref name="imdb.com">{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000004/bio title=John Belushi website=IMDb}}</ref>

==Death==
The day before Belushis death, he visited his longtime manager Bernie Brillstein and asked for cash. Brillstein said no, suspecting Belushi wanted money for drugs.<ref>Bernie Brillstein, Where Did I Go Right? Youre No One in Hollywood Unless Someone Wants You Dead (1999, Little, Brown and Company)</ref> Later in the day, when Brillstein had another visitor, Belushi returned and again asked for money. Brillstein complied, reluctant to rebuke Belushi in front of another person.

Two months later, Smith admitted in an interview with the National Enquirer that she had been with Belushi the night of his death and had given him the fatal speedball shot. After the appearance of the article "I Killed Belushi" in the Enquirer edition of June 29, 1982, the case was reopened. Smith was extradited from Ontario, Canada, arrested, and charged with Murder (United States law)#Degrees first-degree murder. A plea bargain reduced the charge to involuntary manslaughter, and she served 15 months in prison.<ref>{{cite news url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/17/us/figure-in-john-belushi-case-freed-from-california-prison.html  title=Figure in John Belushi Case Freed From California Prison work= The New York Times  date=March 17, 1988  accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref>

According to his SNL fellow, Jane Curtin, who appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2011, Belushi was a misogynist who would deliberately sabotage the work of women writers and comics while working on SNL. "So youd go to a table read, and if a woman writer had written a piece for John, he would not read it in his full voice. He felt as though it was his duty to sabotage pieces written by women."<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/13/john-belushi-sexist-jane-curtain_n_848646.html/ title=John Belushi A Misogynist last=Huffingtonpost first=Huffingtonpost publisher=Huffingtonpost accessdate=June 8, 2008  date=May 7, 2008}}</ref>

During the pre-production of Ghostbusters, Ivan Reitman remarked Slimer was sort of like Bluto in the film Animal House, like the ghost of John Belushi.<ref>Shay, Don (November 1985). Making Ghostbusters, p. 78 annotation. New York Zoetrope, New York NY USA, {{ISBN 0918432685}}. Joe Medjuck says: "One day, during preproduction, we were all sitting around talking about the Onionhead concept, and Ivan remarked that the character was sort of like Bluto in Animal House – like the ghost of John Belushi, in a way, Danny, who was obviously a good friend of Johns, never argued with that. Even so, we never officially said that and we never mentioned it in the script. It was just one way to look at the character, because Onionheads grossness is like Blutos in Animal House. We certainly never expected anyone to recognize him as such, although somehow the word did get out and we received some calls from a few newspapers saying theyd heard we had the ghost of John Belushi in our movie."</ref> Since then, Slimer has been described as "The Ghost of John Belushi" by Dan Aykroyd in many interviews.

At the conclusion of the very first live Saturday Night Live (season 7) SNL episode (Robert Urich/Mink DeVille on March 20, 1982) two weeks after Belushis death, Brian Doyle-Murray gave a tribute to him.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/81/81nbelushi.phtml title=81n: Robert Urich / Mink De Ville last1=  first1=  last2=  first2=  date=  website=Saturday Night Live Transcripts publisher=  accessdate=}}</ref> The American Broadcasting Company ABC Networks similar sketch comedy series Fridays (TV series) Fridays aired a live episode the night of Belushis death.
