===Guest appearances and controversy===
Goldthwait appeared on Late Night with Conan OBrien in 1993, where he tossed furniture and ran around the set, then into the audience.

As a guest on one of the last episodes of The Arsenio Hall Show in April 1994, Goldthwait became demonstrably upset that the program was being cancelled. At the time it was widely believed that Paramount Studios had refused to renew Halls contract because Late Night with David Letterman was now moving to CBS, and Goldthwait took his anger out on Paramount. He stood on the sets couch, spray-painted "Paramount Sucks" on a glass wall, and threw video equipment around the studio. Hall was forced to try to restrain Goldthwait and security was called to the set.<ref>{{ cite web   url = http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-05-01/news/9405010123_1_goldthwait-arsenio-hall-show-comedian   title = Quirky Comedian Erupts On Arsenio Hall Show   publisher = Orlando Sentinel   date = May 1, 1994 }}</ref>

These incidents were later the basis of the plot for his subsequent appearance on The Larry Sanders Show in August 1994, where the fictional talk show hires him in the hope of improving their ratings if he does another stunt. They also inspired a pseudo-fire safety PSA on MadTV.
