Michael Thomas Green (born July 30, 1971) is a Canadians Canadian comedian, actor, filmmaker, and talk show host. Known for his brand of shock comedy, he found mainstream prominence via his MTV television show The Tom Green Show. Green is also known for his roles in the Hollywood films Road Trip (film) Road Trip (2000), Charlies Angels (2000 film) Charlies Angels (2000), Freddy Got Fingered (2001), Stealing Harvard (2002) and Shred (film) Shred (2008). He was briefly married to actress Drew Barrymore.

In June 2003, Green served as a guest host on Late Show with David Letterman, which led to him hosting his own late-night talk show on MTV titled The New Tom Green Show. From 2006 until 2011 he hosted his internet talk show Tom Greens House Tonight from his living room, and began performing stand-up comedy in 2010. From October 2013 to November 2014 Green hosted the live weekly talk-show Tom Green Live on AXS TV.

==Early life==
Green was born in Pembroke, Ontario Pembroke, Ontario, Canada, the first of two sons of Mary Jane, a communications consultant, and Richard Green, a computer systems analyst and retired army captain.
He grew up on a Canadian Army base near Pembroke, CFB Petawawa, and later lived in Gloucester, Ontario (now part of the Ottawa City of Ottawa) where he attended Henry Munro Middle School, Colonel By Secondary School and Cairine Wilson Secondary School.
Green studied television broadcasting at Algonquin College and graduated in 1994.

==Early work (1986–1999)==

===Stand-up comedy===
At age 15, Green started performing stand-up comedy at local clubs, most notably at Yuk Yuks comedy club, and went on to do this for two and a half years until he canceled a booking to go to New York for his rap group.
===Radio===
While attending Algonquin College as a member of the Sigma Pi Fraternity, Green hosted an overnight call-in show on the University of Ottawas campus radio station, CHUO-FM CHUO. The 1990 show, originally a rap music show entitled The Rap Show, was followed by an electronic music show hosted by Glenn Humplik. Through the proximity of their shows, Tom and Glenn met and became friends, based on a common love of zany antics. Toms radio show soon shifted formats to a call-in show (upon the discovery of how to operate the studios call-in lines){{Citation needed date=February 2012}} and the two joined forces to host The Midnight Caller Show (which lasted from 1993 to 1996). The basic format of The Midnight Caller was to have listeners call-in with Tom and Glenn making fun of them (or "razzing" them) and soon after hanging-up on them. The shows novelty and originality made it an underground hit{{Citation needed date=February 2012}} in the Ottawa area.

===Rapper===
In the early 1990s, Green had a short-lived career as a rapper in a group called Organized Rhyme under the alias "MC Bones". His fellow MCs included "Pin the Chameleon". The single "Check The O.R." was nominated  for a Juno Award in Juno Awards of 1993#Best Rap Recording 1993 for Best Rap Recording and won the MuchVibe Best Rap Video (MMVA Award) MuchVibe Best Rap Video award in 1992.

In 1998, Not The Green Tom Show was released by Greens alter-ego MC Face. The theme of the album revolves around MC Face, a pugnacious and foul-mouthed rapper who is constantly angry with and taking verbal jabs at Tom Green, his square producer who brings on some of his buddies from The Tom Green Show.

===The Tom Green Show===
{{main The Tom Green Show}}
Green soon had his own non-paid television show on public-access television on cable TV. The first incarnation of The Tom Green Show aired from September 1994 until 1996 as a one-hour no commercial public cable access program on Rogers Television Rogers Television 22 in the Ottawa region airing 50 episodes in two seasons.
The Tom Green Show was a variety show format, where he would have guests visit the studio and bands play before a live audience. He also had taped segments that typically consisted of stunts played by Green on unsuspecting people. A number of them involved Greens parents, Richard and Mary Jane, who consistently appeared unamused and occasionally angered by Toms antics.
In October 1996, The Tom Green Show aired one time as a pilot on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation CBC. The show was later picked up in Canada by The Comedy Network in 1997 and aired 26 episodes over the course of two seasons.
==Rise to mainstream (1999–2003)==

===MTV and The Tom Green Show===
{{main The Tom Green Show}}
The Tom Green Show was then picked up by MTV in January 1999, where he gained popularity in the United States and worldwide. The format of the MTV version of the show was similar to his original show; it was hosted by Green and co-hosted by two of his long-time friends, Glenn Humplik, who occupied the couch, and Phil Giroux, who sat behind a window at the back of the set and became known as "the guy in the window" usually drinking cups of coffee. Derek Harvie, who co-wrote the show with Green, occasionally appeared in the segments. Many of the sketches were targeted at his parents, both of whom appear to be unimpressed and embarrassed by their sons antics.{{Citation needed date=February 2017}}

The Tom Green Show was renowned for Greens version of shock humor. Some of Greens most notable skits include pretending to "hump" a dead moose (which was referenced by rapper Eminem in "The Real Slim Shady"), having an X-rated lesbian scene  painted on his fathers car (labeled the "Slut Mobile"), drinking milk by sucking on a cows teat, and putting a cow head in his parents bed while they slept because his father was a fan of The Godfather films. Green also hung his own unauthorized piece of art in the National Gallery of Canada (which remained untouched for days) with the added twist of later coming back and vandalizing it to the horror of onlooking patrons.
In a segment, Green went to the press conference of Grey Owl (film) Grey Owl where he serenaded and kissed Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan, thinking Green was a journalist, advised him not to give up his day job. Green also did many segments humiliating his co-host and longtime friend Glenn Humplik; even after the pair had become well-known, Humplik continued working at his phone company job, fearing that his entertainment career might not last. Green teased him about this often and once gave out Humpliks office phone number on the air.

Green eventually wrote a song called "Lonely Swedish (The Bum Bum Song)", which he composed during MTVs Spring Break while doing a show on a cruise ship. After airing the music video on his show and appealing to his audience to request it, the song became an instant number one hit on Total Request Live and was also referred to in Eminems song "The Real Slim Shady". He quickly called for the video to be retired because "its not fair to 98 Degrees." Later, in his autobiography, he revealed that MTV had pressured him to do so in order to maintain the image that Total Request Live was, in fact, a live request show (the next weeks episodes had been pre-taped on location, and the producers of the show were completely unaware of "The Bum Bum Song" at the time).

Greens increasing fame made it harder for him to ambush people during Vox populi man-on-the-street segments, leading him to target mostly old age senior citizens and non-English language English speakers. After he was diagnosed with testicular cancer in March 2000, he stopped production on his TV show, but he continued to appear on the channel via reruns and other promotional materials. Greens popularity during this time led to him gracing the cover of the June 8, 2000 issue of Rolling Stone magazine.

The MTV show Jackass (TV series) Jackass debuted six months after The Tom Green Show went on hiatus. Many of the segments on the show had close similarities to the segments from Greens show: Bam Margera rudely awakening his parents, the cast of Jackass falling down while on crutches, swimming with sharks, etc.
===Testicular cancer and hiatus from MTV===
In early 2000, Tom Green was diagnosed with, and successfully treated for, testicular cancer.
Green wrote, directed and starred in a one-hour MTV television special titled The Tom Green Cancer Special (aired on May 23, 2000
), which documented the time leading up to his surgery and included graphic footage of his own surgery. The episode received wide critical acclaim for revealing a vulnerable, human side of an otherwise juvenile television personality.
During this time, he started the "Tom Greens Nuts Cancer Fund" to raise money for cancer research.
In mid-2000, Green also spoke in front of thousands of students in the University of Florida and sang a song titled "Feel Your Balls" to help educate others about testicular cancer.
Although it was Greens cancer that caused The Tom Green Show to cease production, a frequent rumor says that the show was cancelled because of an alleged segment where Green shows up at a bar mitzvah, or another Jewish event, dressed as Adolf Hitler. Green, however, has repeatedly denied that such a segment exists, and there is no evidence to suggest that such an event occurred.
He mentions the rumor in his 2004 autobiography, Hollywood Causes Cancer, stating that it apparently started when some Boston teenagers were caught videotaping themselves performing a similar stunt and when asked by security, they used the name "Tom Green." Green says, "I would never do a mean-spirited, anti-Semitic joke like that – its both abhorrent and not funny. To this day I still get asked about it, and its annoying. So again, for the record, it didnt happen. There is nobody on this planet that has ever seen this bit on tape because it does not exist. If it did exist, it would have certainly reared its ugly, hateful head on the Internet by now. But it wont, because it doesnt exist. Ive never put on a Hitler costume. In fact, Ive never even been to a Bar Mitzvah."

===Film career===
Greens fame soon netted him roles in several Hollywood movies, including Road Trip (film) Road Trip, Charlies Angels (2000 film) Charlies Angels, Freddy Got Fingered (which he also wrote and directed), and Stealing Harvard. Green continued the trend of his brand of comedy in Road Trip in a notable scene where he put a mouse in his mouth.

Freddy Got Fingered won in five categories at the 2001 Golden Raspberry Awards, given to the worst movies of the year. Green appeared at the ceremony to accept his awards, making him the first performer to do so in the awards twenty-year history, and the second recipient to do so following director Paul Verhoeven for Showgirls in 1995.
Green arrived at the awards ceremony in a white Cadillac, wearing a tuxedo and rolled out his own red carpet.
After accepting the awards, Green stated "When we set out to make this film we wanted to win a Razzie, so this is a dream come true for me".
While onstage, he began to play the harmonica and did not stop until he was dragged off.

===Marriage to Drew Barrymore and Saturday Night Live===
In July 2000, Tom Green became engaged to actress Drew Barrymore. Green and Barrymore met after Barrymore, who was a fan of Greens show, asked Green to appear in Charlies Angels (2000 film) Charlies Angels, which Barrymore starred in and produced. Green and Barrymore married on July 7, 2001.
In Greens book Hollywood Causes Cancer, he writes "We lived together for a year before we were engaged, and we were engaged for a year before we got married".
Barrymore also appeared in her then-fiancés infamous 2001 film Freddy Got Fingered.

During the buildup to their wedding Green and Barrymore frequently joked with the media about when and where they were going to wed. The most notable incident came on November 18, 2000, when Green hosted the American television show Saturday Night Live. During the monologue, Green brought Barrymore on stage and teased the audience about the couple marrying at the end of the episode. Ultimately, the stage was set for a wedding before Barrymore, in the end, got "cold feet" and left Green alone to end the show. The SNL incident initially left viewers and the media confused about whether the couple had actually planned to marry on live TV, or were simply staging a publicity stunt. Eventually, Green also went on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno to toy with the public once again, this time claiming that his bride might be pregnancy pregnant.{{citation needed date=March 2009}}

Barrymore and Green filed for divorce on December 17, 2001, citing irreconcilable differences.
Their divorce became official on October 15, 2002.
===Return to MTV and The New Tom Green Show===
In 2002, Green starred in and directed a one-hour MTV special called The Tom Green Subway Monkey Hour, where he tormented strangers in Japan. During 2002, Green also started his own production company called Bob Green Films;
he starred in and was executive producer for a half-hour special entitled The Skateboard Show on The WB.
In mid-2003, after Green guest-hosted The Late Show with David Letterman, MTV gave him his own late-night talk show called The New Tom Green Show. The critically acclaimed{{citation needed date=March 2016}} show lasted less than three months and the show consisted of a traditional monologue, segments, followed by interviews with guests. Green in numerous interviews has stated that David Letterman was one of his early influences.
In September 2003, the show was cancelled by MTV eleven weeks after its premiere due to low ratings.
Reports indicate that ratings and viewers for the show averaged 889,000 viewers in the first week and then averaged 255,000 viewers in the last week for the reruns.
In Greens book Hollywood Causes Cancer, he stated that the show, "was very expensive to produce and not really the type of show that MTV has been traditionally known for."
==Post-MTV (2004–present)==

===Autobiography===
On October 12, 2004, Green released his autobiography
Hollywood Causes Cancer: The Tom Green Story, which discussed in detail his Hollywood career, short-lived marriage to Drew Barrymore, and his experience dealing with testicular cancer.

A notable incident discussed in the book involved Green on character-based talk show Primetime Glick with Jiminy Glick (played by Martin Short).
Green wrote that this un-aired interview was the first time he walked off any show, and this was due in part to Short being "mean" and making fun of his testicle.
When Short brought up the incident in a 2005 interview, Green defended his stance on his online blog.

===More mainstream===
In the 2000s, Green has tried to put some of his more controversial material behind him and become a more mainstream entertainer. Green was a recurring contributor to The Tonight Show with Jay Leno; doing many segments where he travels across America looking for "interesting people", typically bringing the most colourful person with him back to the studio. In these segments, the focus is more on the odd behavior of the interviewees, with Green generally playing the straight man.

===Tomgreen.com: The Channel (2006–2011, 2015)===
{{main Tom Greens House Tonight}}
File:Tom Green, Thora Birch and Neil Hamburger.jpg thumb left Green, Thora Birch, and Neil Hamburger at The Channel in 2006
On June 5, 2006, ManiaTV.com announced they had formed a partnership with Green to host a live talk show from his own living room in the Hollywood Hills overlooking the San Fernando Valley. The first show aired live on June 15, 2006 at 11 pm EST, was originally called Tom Green Live!, and was airing Mondays through Thursdays.
In January 2008, shortly after Greens split from ManiaTV, the show was renamed Tom Greens House Tonight. The shows are broadcast live at TomGreen.com. A pared-down version was later broadcast on The Comedy Network and various local channels in the United States, until Green stopped syndicating the show to television. On a 2009 blog, Green noted that he stopped his show from syndication on television due to dissatisfaction with his lack of creative control. He continues to broadcast the show from his website. Green later started a monthly subscription service that allowed subscribers to have full access to all the videos on his website.

Due to lack of an established term, Green often refers to his live streaming broadcast as "Web-o-Vision." He also jokingly says he is broadcasting to "The National Internet", despite the show having a worldwide audience. Green often refers to his show as, "The highest rated, longest running, and only talk show on the Internet."

From Greens website, Tom Greens House Tonight typically aired live on weeknights at 10 pm EST, although shows can begin at any time during the day and night. The shows were then archived on his website. The format of the show often includes Green taking live telephone calls and Skype video calls where viewers around the world are able to chat with Green and his guests. Green would often be a victim of prank calls due to the live nature of the show and would sometimes voice his frustration with the callers.

There have been hundreds of shows with many notable guests including stars such as Adam Carolla, Val Kilmer, Thora Birch, Pamela Anderson, hip-hop artists Blackalicious and Xzibit, skateboarder Tony Hawk, former Total Request Live TRL host and talk show host Carson Daly, guitarist Dave Navarro, actor Crispin Glover, Digg Digg.com founder Kevin Rose, comedic musician "Weird Al" Yankovic, as well as comedians Neil Hamburger, Andrew Dice Clay, Joe Rogan, and Andy Dick. The longest standard format show, in which Green interviewed Steve-O, ran for 3.5 hours and ended with Green drunk and Steve-O heavily Substance intoxication intoxicated.

When Green does not have guests, he has done many unconventional shows such as playing the saxophone for an hour, having a week dedicated to performing karaoke, or updating the viewers about The Channel while taking telephone and Skype calls.

On his website, Green has talked about the substantial costs of continuing the online show and that The Channel may be gone in mid-2011 if it is not profitable by then. In 2011, Green ended the subscription service on his website and stated that his live show is on hiatus. Green also took down the TV studio that was in his living room.

During the summer of 2015, Green brought back his web-o-vision show and hosts it daily from his studio in Burbank.

On August 13, 2010, after being invited, Green performed stand-up comedy at the Gathering of the Juggalos. He was later involved in attempting to calm the audience down after Tila Tequila had rocks, excrement and urine thrown at her during her performance at the same event.
In subsequent interviews, Green said he successfully calmed the audience down for 10 minutes, but things got worse when he left the stage. Tequila continued performing for an additional 20 minutes and eventually suffered facial injuries after being struck in the face by a rock.
In an April 2013 interview on discussing his theories on his stand-up comedy, Green states:
{{bquote I dont really like picking on the little guy. I don’t like picking on people who are minorities, less fortunate, disabled or people who are not powerful people. I want to sort of speak truth to power, to government, to the system that were living in that we’re not really in control of. I stay away from making fun of people. I dont do a lot of racial issues. I don’t do a lot of religious humor. I dont really do a lot of making fun of people for the way they look. I dont really do a lot of making fun of people for their sexual orientation or their sex. Thats not my style. Thats, by the way, what a lot of people do in comedy. They talk about these things because its sometimes an easier laugh. I’m more trying to challenge myself and talk about things like corporate America or addiction to technology or legalizing drugs and the government and freedoms that we have that are being stripped away. Its finding humor in all of that stuff.

I do feel like Im trying to change the way people think about their own lives with my standup. Im not just trying to get a laugh from people, but I actually want people to walk out of there and critically analyze how we’re living our lives in this modern era. Were stuck on our Facebook pages and giving up our privacy in a surveillance society and were forced to go through metal detectors and X-ray machines everywhere we go and giving up our freedoms and living in a fear-based society afraid of terrorism and war and all this stuff. There are a lot of outrageous things that are happening right now in our world that have never happened in my lifetime. I see it happening and it scares me and worries me, so I think if I can get people to laugh about it and think about it and talk about it after the show, I get a lot of enjoyment and fulfillment out of that.}}
