==Controversies==
===Plagiarism===
For many years, Leary had been friends with fellow comedian Bill Hicks. When Learys comedy album No Cure for Cancer was released, Leary was accused of stealing Hickss act and material. The friendship ended abruptly as a result.<ref name="evolutionBook">{{cite book title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution last1=Booth first1=Kevin last2=Bertin first2=Michael year=2005 publisher=Harper Collins isbn=0-00-719829-9}}</ref> In April 1993, the Austin Comedy News remarked on the similarities of Learys performance, "Watching Leary is like seeing Hicks from two years ago. He Tobacco smoking smokes with the same mannerisms. (Hicks recently quit.) He sports the same attitude, the same clothes. He touches on almost all of the same themes. Leary even invokes Jim Fixx." When asked about this, Hicks told the magazine, "I have a scoop for you. I stole his [Learys] act. I camouflaged it with punchlines, and to really throw people off, I did it before he did".<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.gavinsblog.com/probill.htm title=Profile: Bill Hicks first=Doug last=Stern date=April 1993 work=Austin Comedy News accessdate=October 22, 2006}}</ref>

During Learys 2003 Comedy Central Roast, comedian Lenny Clarke, a friend of Learys, said there was a carton of cigarettes backstage from Bill Hicks with the message, "Wish I had gotten these to you sooner." This joke was cut from the final broadcast.<ref>{{cite news last=Ziano III first=Nick A. title=Roasting a comic, they turn up the flames, gently work=Boston Globe url=http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030811054820/http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/222/living/Roasting_a_comic_they_turn_up_the_flames_gently+.shtml archivedate=August 11, 2003 date=August 10, 2003}}</ref>

The feud is also mentioned in Cynthia Trues biography American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story:
{{quote text=Leary was in Montreal to host the "Nasty Show," at Club Soda (Montreal) Club Soda, and Colleen was coordinating the talent so she was standing backstage when she heard Leary doing material that sounded incredibly similar to old Hicks riffs, including his perennial Jim Fixx joke: ("Keith Richards outlived Jim Fixx, the runner and health nut dude. The plot thickens."). When Leary came offstage, Colleen, more stunned than angry, said, "Hey, you know thats Bill Hicks material! Do you know thats his material?" Leary stood there, stared at her without saying a word and briskly left the dressing room.<ref name="oouuos">{{cite book title=American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story first=Cynthia last=True year=2002 publisher=Harper Paperbacks isbn=0-380-80377-1}}</ref>}}

According to the book, True said upon hearing a tape of Learys album No Cure for Cancer, "Bill was furious. All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Learys lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff and even bought bits from one another. Milton Berle and Robin Williams were famous for it. This was different. Leary had, practically line for line, taken huge chunks of Bills act and recorded it."<ref name="oouuos"/>

In a 2008 appearance on The Opie and Anthony Show, comedian Louis CK claimed that Leary stole his "Im an asshole" routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary.<ref>{{cite video url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwhxqnCyoGo title=Denis Leary ripped off "Im An Asshole" from Louis CK via=YouTube}}</ref> On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming to have co-written the song with Chris Phillips.<ref>{{cite video url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g81LCwrU-7k&feature=related title=Denis Leary responds to Louis CK claiming he stole "Im An Asshole" from him work=Opie & Anthony Show date=November 18, 2008 accessdate=December 1, 2012 via=YouTube}}</ref>

===Autism===
In his 2008 book Why We Suck Why We Suck: A Feel Good Guide to Staying Fat, Loud, Lazy and Stupid, Leary wrote:{{quote There is a huge boom in Autism spectrum disorder autism right now because inattentive mothers and competitive dads want an explanation for why their dumb-ass kids cant compete academically, so they throw money into the happy laps of Psychiatrist shrinks... to get back diagnoses that help explain away the deficiencies of their junior morons. I dont [care] what these crackerjack whack jobs tell you – your kid is not autistic. Hes just stupid. Or lazy. Or both.}}

In response to the controversy, Leary stated that the quote was taken out of context and that in that paragraph he had been talking about the trend of unwarranted over-diagnosis of autism, which he attributed to American parents seeking an excuse for behavioral problems and under-performance. Later, he apologized to parents with autistic children whom he had offended.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.usmagazine.com/news/denis-leary-says-autism-Criticism-taken-out-of-context title=Denis Leary Says Autism Criticism Taken Out of Context date=October 16, 2008 work=Us Weekly accessdate=May 22, 2011 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018134220/http://www.usmagazine.com/news/denis-leary-says-autism-Criticism-taken-out-of-context archivedate=October 18, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://news.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/2008_10_28_Denis_Leary_Tells_Parents:_I_m_Sorry:_%E2%80%98Raising_Children_With_Autism__Deserves_Admiration__Comic_Says/srvc=home&position=0 title=Denis Leary Tells Parents: Im Sorry first=Laurel J. last=Sweet date=October 28, 2008 work=Boston Herald accessdate=May 22, 2011 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203105558/http://news.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/2008_10_28_Denis_Leary_Tells_Parents%3A_I_m_Sorry%3A_%E2%80%98Raising_Children_With_Autism__Deserves_Admiration__Comic_Says/srvc%3Dhome%26position%3D0 archivedate=February 3, 2011 df=mdy-all}}</ref>
