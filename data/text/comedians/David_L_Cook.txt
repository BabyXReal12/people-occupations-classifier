In all of Cooks overseas recordings his surname is Cooke to distinguish it from his work in the United States. The male members of The Cook Family Singers have always used just their middle initials as a trademark, a trait beginning back in 1885 when the first such group was formed.<ref name="Come Follow Me">{{cite web url=http://cdbaby.com/cd/davidlcook1 title=CD Baby: DAVID L. COOK: Come Follow Me accessdate=February 8, 2008 publisher=CD Baby}}</ref>

In 1990 Cook was diagnosed with a dissociative disorder and psychogenic amnesia reportedly brought on by an abusive father. In 1999 Cooks story was used as a lead story with The 700 Club.<ref name="Official bio"/>

==Biography==
Cook was born in Pascagoula, Mississippi; after two years, his family moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Cook began his musical career at age five, singing with his familys group, The Cook Family Singers. After his parents divorce, the group continued without Donnell, but in 1980, the group disbanded because of Junes health issues.<ref name="David L. Cook MP3 Downloads">{{cite web url=http://www.mp3.com/artist/david-l-cook/summary title=David L. Cook MP3 Downloads accessdate=February 1, 2008 publisher=mp3.com}}</ref> He continued singing both gospel and secular music.

==Early life==
Early in life, Cook was abused by his father, who had a severe drinking problem. While intoxicated, Cooks father reportedly became violent towards his family. After many years of this abuse Cook developed many psychological problems that ended up following him through to his life as an adult. He developed a severe dissociative disorder and psychogenic amnesia. He recalled having periods of "missing time" but never really understood the cause. In 1990, doctors finally diagnosed the disorders after Cook experienced what they thought was a severe stroke and was rushed to the Coral Springs Medical Hospital in Fort. Lauderdale.<ref name="Broward Health">{{cite web url=http://www.browardhealth.org/body.cfm?id=64 title=Broward Health accessdate=February 1, 2008 publisher=Coral Springs Medical Hospital archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404001013/http://www.browardhealth.org/body.cfm?id=64  archivedate=April 4, 2007  deadurl=yes}}</ref>

He checked himself out of the hospital and disappeared from his Florida home and was found five months later in a Charlotte, North Carolina, hospital with similar health complaints. Cook had been around Charlotte for five months and no one realized there was anything wrong until he started developing stroke symptoms again. Doctors diagnosed his problems, which were not organic, and referred him to see the proper specialists. He claims to have had no recollection of leaving Florida, nor what he had done during his five months in Charlotte. When asked, he stated that, "It was like someone switching off a light and then switching it back on."<ref name="Official bio">[http://www.davidlcook.com David L. Cook official website]; accessed April 5, 2014.</ref> Cooks story has been told through different media. The 700 Club did a full-length documentary about his life, which aired worldwide.<ref name="Official bio"/> Cook wrote a religious self-help book, Inspirational Words about the issues he overcame.<ref name="amazon.com">{{cite web url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1414049544 website=www.amazon.com accessdate=November 19, 2010 title=Inspirational Words date=February 17, 2004}}</ref>

==Health==
On November 11, 2009, Cook was diagnosed with a parathyroid tumor in his neck. Doctors assessed that the tumor was pressing against his vocal cords making it virtually impossible for him to perform. He was treated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.<ref name="Official bio"/>

The company is still in business today under different ownership.<ref name="SUNBIZ.org">{{cite web url=http://sunbiz.org/scripts/cordet.exe?action=DETFIL&inq_doc_number=J89845&inq_came_from=NAMFWD&cor_web_names_seq_number=0000&names_name_ind=N&names_cor_number=&names_name_seq=&names_name_ind=&names_comp_name=COOKSCARCARE&names_filing_type= title=SUNBIZ accessdate=December 15, 2009}}</ref> He incorporated Cook Productions International in 1989 with his business partner Edward Cook.<!-- any relation?? --> Cook <!-- which Cook?? -->sold his interests in 1992, which dissolved the Florida division.<ref name="SUNBIZ.org"/>

In 1999 Cook started DLC Records after leaving Mountainview Records due to contractual and other disputes. While on the label Cook took his 1999 project, In The Middle of it All, up the charts garnering several No. 1 singles, a Dove Award nomination and became the number one selling Christian country artists of all time.<ref name="Official bio"/> He incorporated Cook Enterprises to administer his contracts and personal business affairs, which included a childrens television show development agreement with his management group, Five Star Music which produced a weekly show called, Crabbottom USA, taped at local television station, WHTV TV-39, a Nashville Tennessee based station.<ref name="Official bio"/>

In 2004, Cook was presented with the opportunity to become the CEO and controlling partner for the International Academy of Music Arts and Sciences (IAMAS Corporation).<ref name="IAMAS">{{cite web url=http://iamascorp.com/about.php title=IAMAS Corporation publisher=IAMAS Corporation accessdate=December 15, 2009 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505035859/http://www.iamascorp.com/about.php archivedate=May 5, 2009 df=}}</ref> Years earlier, the company merged with its daughter company, The American Musical Academy of Arts Association, which proved profitable as there was an upswing in demand for Christian-based music and distribution opportunities. This was profitable as IAMAS was able to use its history in the entertainment industry as a door to help boost other smaller companies into existence.<ref name="IAMAS"/> In 2004, the entertainment industry took a huge hit with the incoming markets of Napster, iTunes, and Amazon.com. IAMAS, no longer able to compete, decided to sell off only its American division and retain its overseas holdings.

His offer was accepted and he officially filed for corporation status on November 24, 2004.<ref name="North Carolina Secretary of State">{{cite web url=http://www.secretary.state.nc.us/corporations/searchresults.aspx?onlyactive=OFF&Words=STARTING&searchstr=The%20International%20Academy%20of%20Music%20Arts%20and%20Sciences title=North Carolina Secretary of State publisher=State of North Carolina accessdate=December 15, 2009}}</ref>

On November 11, 2011, The Artists Music Guild held its inaugural convention at the historic Heritage USA complex. The inaugural convention was filmed for a PBS special, A Walk Through the History of Music in the United States, with more than 2000 people in attendance. Cook has stated that his main goal for making the Heritage USA the official home of the Artists Music Guilds convention was to heal the broken people who were affected by the fall of PTL. The convention reunited several of the former PTL Singers, including Toni Bogart, Brian Keith, Lee Young and Sandy and Russell Hosey. Also in attendance were many of the employees who lost their jobs amid the sexual and financial scandal which caused the fall of the Bakkers ministry.<ref name="Cook Reunites Former PTL Singers">{{cite web title=Cook reunites former PTL Singers url=http://www.fortmilltimes.com/2011/11/11/1783845/guild-event-to-reunite-artists.html work=Artists Music Guild publisher=Fort Mill Times accessdate=November 29, 2011 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426010235/http://www.fortmilltimes.com/2011/11/11/1783845/guild-event-to-reunite-artists.html archivedate=April 26, 2012 df=}}</ref> Cook posited that "by reuniting these individuals who have not performed together in over twenty plus years it would allow them to come together on their own terms and walk out of the complex without someone telling them they could never come back. It was the ultimate form of healing the hurts from the past."<ref name="Cook Reunites Former PTL Singers"/> In 2015 the Guild became the parent company for the Mississippi Music Foundation in an effort to build a youth orchestra and a better outreach to educating and developing young and upcoming artists.
