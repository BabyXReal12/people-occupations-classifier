When the cinema screened Alfred Hitchcocks Strangers on a Train (film) Strangers on a Train (1951), having already seen the film and loving it, she advised two patrons arriving during the last five minutes of a showing to wait until the beginning of the next showing to avoid spoiling the ending for them, but the couple insisted on being seated.

During this time, she performed in several university productions, garnering recognition for her comedic and musical abilities. Her mother disapproved of her acting ambitions:

{{cquote She wanted me to be a writer. She said you can always write, no matter what you look like. When I was growing up she told me to be a little lady, and a couple of times I got a whack for crossing my eyes or making funny faces.

The young Burnett, always insecure about her looks, responded many years later to her mothers advice of "You can always write, no matter what you look like" by noting "God, that hurt!" in her memoir One More Time (1986).

During her junior year at UCLA in 1954, a professor invited Burnett and some other students to perform at a party in place of their class final that had been canceled (which required a performance in front of an audience). Afterwards, a man and his wife approached her while Carol was stuffing cookies in her purse to take home to her grandmother.<ref name=SILive>{{cite web url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711165327/https://www.silive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/04/carol_burnett_on_staten_island.html title=Carol Burnett: 10 things to know before the comedy legend plays St. George last=Bailey first=Rob work=Staten Island Advance publisher=Advance Publications location=Staten Island date=April 3, 2015 accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref name=Sun>{{cite web url=http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/story.html?id=2001007 title=Carol Burnetts comedy reign extends into dramatic role last=Birnie first=Peter work=The Vancouver Sun publisher=Postmedia Network location=Vancouver date=September 16, 2009 accessdate=March 23, 2011}}{{dead link date=December 2017  bot=InternetArchiveBot  fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Instead of reprimanding her, the man complimented her performance and asked about her future plans.

==Career==

===Early career===
After spending her first year in New York working as a hat-check girl and failing to land acting jobs, Burnett along with other girls living at the Rehearsal Club (New York City) Rehearsal Club, a boarding house for women seriously pursuing an acting career, put on The Rehearsal Club Revue on March 3, 1955. They mailed invitations to agents, who showed up along with stars like Celeste Holm and Marlene Dietrich, and this opened doors for several of the girls. She was cast in a minor role on The Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney Show in 1955. She played the girlfriend of a ventriloquist’s dummy on the popular children’s program. This role led to her starring role opposite Buddy Hackett in the short-lived sitcom Stanley (1956 TV series) Stanley from 1956 to 1957.

After Stanley, Burnett found herself unemployed for a short time. She eventually bounced back a few months later as a highly popular performer on the New York circuit of cabarets and night clubs, most notably for a hit parody number called "I Made a Fool of Myself Over John Foster Dulles" (Dulles was United States Secretary of State Secretary of State at the time). In 1957, she performed this number on both The Tonight Show, hosted by Jack Paar, and The Ed Sullivan Show. Dulles was asked about her on Meet the Press and joked,  “I never discuss matters of the heart in public.”<ref name=MTprize/>

She also worked as a regular on one of televisions earliest game shows, Pantomime Quiz, during this time. In 1957, just as she was achieving her first small successes, her mother died.{{citation needed date=February 2015}}<del></del>

Burnetts first true taste of success came with her appearance on Broadway in the 1959 musical Once Upon a Mattress, for which she was nominated for a Tony Award. The same year, she became a regular player on The Garry Moore Show, a job that lasted until 1962. She won an Emmy Award<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/carol-burnett title=Carol Burnett Emmy Winner publisher=The Emmys accessdate=December 27, 2011}}</ref> that year for her "Outstanding Performance in a Variety or Musical Program or Series" on the show. She portrayed a number of characters, most memorably the put-upon cleaning woman who would later become her signature alter-ego. With her success on the Moore Show, Burnett finally rose to headliner status and appeared in the special Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall (1962), co-starring with her friend Julie Andrews. The show was produced by Bob Banner, directed by Joe Hamilton (producer) Joe Hamilton, and written by Mike Nichols and Ken Welch.<ref>{{cite book url=https://www.amazon.com/How-Sweet-Was-Television-Commentary/dp/B000VMS8D8 last1=Shulman first1=Arthur last2=Youman first2=Roger title=How Sweet it Was: Television- A Pictorial Commentary year=1966 publisher=Crown Publishing Group#Imprints Bonanza Books location=New York City edition=Reprint isbn=978-0517081358 asin=B000VMS8D8}}</ref>{{ref 1 1}} Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Program Achievement in the Field of Music, and Burnett won an Emmy for her performance.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.emmys.com/content/julie-and-carol-carnegie-hall-and-carol-and-com title=Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall AND Carol and Com website=www.emmys.com accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref> She also guest-starred on a number of shows during this time, including The Twilight Zone episode "Cavender Is Coming".

In 1964, Burnett starred in the Broadway musical Fade Out – Fade In but was forced to withdraw after sustaining a neck injury in a taxi accident. She returned to the show later but withdrew again to participate in a variety show, The Entertainers, opposite Caterina Valente and Bob Newhart. The producers of Fade Out – Fade In sued the actress for breach of contract after her absences from the popular show caused its failure, but the suit was later dropped. The Entertainers ran for only one season.{{sfn Suskin 2006 pages=90–93}}

Around the same time, she became good friends with Jim Nabors, who was enjoying great success with his series Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. As a result of their close friendship, she played a recurring role on Nabors show as a tough corporal, later gunnery sergeant (starting with the episode Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.

In 1966, Lucille Ball became a friend and mentor to Burnett. After having guested on Burnetts highly successful CBS-TV special Carol + 2 and having the younger performer reciprocate by appearing on The Lucy Show, Ball reportedly offered Burnett her own sitcom called "Heres Agnes," to be produced by Desilu Productions. She declined the offer, not wanting to commit herself to a weekly series. The two remained close friends until Balls death in 1989. Ball sent flowers every year on Burnetts birthday. When Burnett awoke on the day of her 56th birthday in 1989, she discovered via the morning news that Lucille Ball had died. Later that afternoon, flowers arrived at Burnetts house with a note reading, "Happy Birthday, Kid. Love, Lucy."<ref name="MitchellFink">{{cite book last=Fink first=Mitchell title=The Last Days of Dead Celebrities url=https://www.amazon.com/Last-Days-Dead-Celebrities/dp/1401360254 year=2007 publisher=Miramax Books location=New York City isbn=978-1401360252}}</ref>

In 1967, CBS offered to put Burnett in a weekly comedy series called Heres Agnes. However, she had a stipulation in her ten-year contract with CBS that said she had five years from the date The Garry Moore Show ended to "push the button" on hosting thirty one-hour episodes of a music/comedy variety show. As a result, the hour-long Carol Burnett Show was born and debuted in September 1967, garnering 23 Emmy Awards and winning or being nominated for multiple Emmy and Golden Globe Awards every season it was on the air. Its ensemble cast included Tim Conway (who was a guest player until the ninth season),<ref name="ET">Interview on Entertainment Tonight. New York City: CBS Television Distribution. Retrieved May 22, 2006.</ref> Harvey Korman, Lyle Waggoner, and the teenaged Vicki Lawrence, whom Burnett herself discovered and mentored.

A true variety show, The Carol Burnett Show struck a chord with viewers. Among other things, it parodied films ("Went With the Wind" for Gone with the Wind (film) Gone With the Wind), television ("As the Stomach Turns" for the soap opera As the World Turns) and commercials. Musical numbers were also a frequent feature. Burnett and her team struck gold with the original sketch "The Family", which eventually was spun off into its own television show called Mamas Family, starring Vicki Lawrence.

She opened most shows with an impromptu question-and-answer session with the audience, lasting a few minutes, during which she often demonstrated her ability to humorously ad lib. On numerous occasions, she obliged when asked to perform her trademark<ref>{{cite web  url=http://allday.today.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2008/03/12/4378081-carol-burnetts-tarzan-yell  title=Carol Burnetts Tarzan Yell  publisher=allDAY on Today (U.S. TV program) Today  date=March 12, 2008  accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref> Tarzan yell.

She ended each show by tugging on her left ear, which was a message to her grandmother who raised her. This was done to let her know that she was doing well and that she loved her. During the shows run, her grandmother died. On an Intimate Portrait episode on Burnett, she tearfully recalled her grandmothers last moments: "She said to my husband Joe from her hospital bed Joe, you see that spider up there? There was no spider, but Joe said he did anyhow. She said Every few minutes a big spider jumps on that little spider and they go at it like rabbits!! And then she died. Theres laughter in everything!"<ref>Lifetime (TV network) Lifetime Channels Intimate Portrait episode on Burnett</ref> She continued the tradition of tugging her ear.

The Carol Burnett Show ceased production in 1978, Four post-script episodes were produced and aired on American Broadcasting Company ABC during the summer of 1979 under the title, Carol Burnett & Company basically using the same format and, with the exception of Harvey Korman and Lyle Waggoner, the same supporting cast. Beginning in 1977, the comedy sketches of her series were edited into half-hour episodes for syndication entitled Carol Burnett and Friends, which, for many years, proved to be extremely popular in syndication, and in January 2015, it began airing on MeTV.

The shows enduring popularity surprised many when a 2001 retrospective containing outtakes and discussions with the cast, and a tribute to Bob Mackie, drew in 30 million viewers, topping the Emmy Awards as well as all but the final game of that years World Series.<ref name= "Heartbreak" />

Her Grammy-winning memoir In Such Good Company is about the show, and Burnett tells about how it was developed, with anecdotes about improvisations, the cast, crew, and guests.

She was good friends with Lucille Ball, Beverly Sills and Jim Nabors, and remains good friends with Julie Andrews and Betty White. She is the acting mentor to her protégée Vicki Lawrence. They share a close friendship, as noted by Lawrence in a testimonial speech during her appearance at Burnetts 2013 Mark Twain Award in Washington, D.C. (recorded and broadcast on PBS Television).<ref>{{Cite news url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2013/10/21/carol-burnett-honored-by-tina-fey-amy-poehler-and-other-stars-at-kennedy-center-laughfest-photos/ title=Carol Burnett Honored by Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Other Stars at Kennedy Center Laughfest (Photos) {{!}} Washingtonian date=October 21, 2013 work=Washingtonian access-date=April 29, 2018 language=en-US}}</ref>

In a 2003 interview with Terry Gross on Fresh Air, Burnett said that both she and her daughter Jody had corrective dental surgery. Burnett had an overbite resulting in a weak chin, and her daughter had an Malocclusion underbite. After consulting the oral surgeon about Jodys bite, he said he could repair hers as well, giving her more of a chin, so both of them got operations. Prior to this, Burnett had worked on the 1982 film Annie (1982 film) Annie and was called back to reshoot part of a scene after having recovered from the surgery. The scene involved her character entering and exiting a closet to retrieve a necklace. She told the director, John Huston, that she was concerned about her chin looking different from entering the closet to exiting it, and he simply told her to "look determined". The scene is still in the film.<ref name= "NPRMattress">{{cite web url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5056760 title=Carol Burnett Returns to the Mattress last=Gross  first=Terry  work=Fresh Air publisher=NPR date=October 13, 2003 accessdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref>

==Libel case==
{{main Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.}}

In 1976, a false report in the nations leading supermarket tabloid journalism tabloid, The National Enquirer, incorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her.  Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against the Enquirer, in 1981.  Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 by a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out-of-court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims of tabloid journalism.<ref name="carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi">Scott, Vernon, [http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ "Carol Burnett launches trial balloon,"], March 22, 1981, United Press International (UPI), retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name="carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes">Lindsey, Robert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html "Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer,"], March 27, 1981, The New York Times, retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name="how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html "How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court,"] January 4, 1991, The New York Times, retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name="tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes">Langberg, Barry (libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others), opinion essay: [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids "Tabloids Lies Abuse the First Amendment,"] August 12, 1991, ,"], The Los Angeles Times, retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name="tabloid_law_pt1_1999_08_atlantic">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ "Tabloid Law,"] Part 1 of two parts, August, 1999, The Atlantic Monthly, retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name="tabloid_law_pt2_1999_08_atlantic">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ "Tabloid Law,"] Part 2 of two parts, August, 1999, The Atlantic Monthly, retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name="dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post">Andrews, Travis M., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ "Dr_ Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation,"] July 14, 2016, The Washington Post, retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref>

The former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book The Untold Story, asserted that after the Burnett lawsuit, while under his leadership, the Enquirer worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.
