==Early life==
Originally from Manhattan, Kansas Manhattan, Kansas,
she has been performing in New York City for over a decade. Per Everett on the podcast Amy Schumer Presents: 3 Girls, 1 Keith (episode 2: "Moms and Stuff"): “I’m from Manhattan, Kansas- the little apple. And my dad was mayor at one point, and then so was my brother many years later. So we’re kinda like the Kennedy’s of Manhattan, Kansas."

Everett attended college at Arizona State University on a full scholarship to study music and opera.  She worked in the restaurant business for 25 years before she was finally able to quit around the beginning of 2015.
==Career==
Everett met Amy Schumer at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in 2009.
Everett has been regularly opening for Schumer on her comedy tours since 2012
to present.  Everett has even upstaged Schumer, then leading Schumer to want to have Everett close for her instead, according to Schumer on her new podcast.
Everett often performs with her band, The Tender Moments, which includes Adam “Ad-Rock” Horovitz from the Beastie Boys and Carmine Covelli from The Julie Ruin. In October 2013, Everett and Horovitz performed in a show called Rock Bottom that the two co-wrote with Hairspray (musical) Hairspray songwriters Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman.
Rock Bottom won Everett the 2015 Obie Awards Special Citation presented by the American Theatre Wing.
Bridget has also performed with Brad Williams (comedian) Brad Williams in a show called Down n Dirty (hosted by Broad City{{’}}s Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer) at the 2014 Bonnaroo Music Festival.

Bridget performed a duet of Me and Bobby McGee with Patti LuPone at Carnegie Hall.
In 2013, Bridget Everett and the Tender Moments released an album with twelve tracks entitled Pound It!

Everetts first one-hour TV special, Bridget Everett: Gynecological Wonder, premiered on Comedy Central in 2015. In it, she performs her usual brand of comedy cabaret.
