==Career==
===With Dean Martin===
{{Main Martin and Lewis}}

File:Lewis and Martin.jpg thumb 200px Lewis with Dean Martin in 1950
Lewis initially gained attention as part of a double act with singer Dean Martin, who served as straight man (stock character) straight man to Lewis zany antics as the Martin and Lewis comedy team. They were different from other duo acts of the time because they played to each other and had ad-libbed improvisational segments within their planned routines.

After forming in 1946, they quickly rose to national prominence, first with their popular nightclub act, then as stars of The Martin and Lewis Show on the radio NBC Red Network.<ref name="varietyobit" /> The two made appearances on early live television on their June 20, 1948 debut broadcast on Toast of the Town (later renamed as The Ed Sullivan Show on September 25, 1955) on CBS.<ref>{{cite web url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/comedy-icon-jerry-lewis-dies-91/story?id=49323636 title=Comedy icon Jerry Lewis dies at 91 last=McKenzie first=Joi-Marie date=2017-08-20 website=ABC News access-date=2017-08-20}}</ref>
This was followed on October 3, 1948, by an appearance on NBCs Welcome Aboard (TV series) Welcome Aboard.

In 1950, Martin and Lewis signed with NBC to be one of a series of weekly rotating hosts of The Colgate Comedy Hour, a live Sunday evening broadcast.  Lewis, writer for the team’s nightclub act, hired Norman Lear and Ed Simmons as regular writers for their Comedy Hour material.<ref>{{cite web url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/norman-lear-recalls-early-days-as-tv-comedy-writer-1201629371/ title=Norman Lear Looks Back on Early Days as TV Comedy Writer first=Tim last=Gray date=October 30, 2015 publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12-IA1 title=Billboard first=Nielsen Business Media last=Inc date=October 31, 1953 publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. via=Google Books}}</ref> Their Comedy Hour shows consisted of stand-up dialogue, song and dance from their nightclub act and movies, backed by Dick Stabile’s big band, slapstick and satirical sketch comedy, Martin’s solo songs, and Lewis’ solo pantomimes or physical numbers.

Martin and Lewis often broke character, ad-libbing and Fourth wall breaking the fourth wall. While not completely capturing the orchestrated mayhem of their nightclub act, the Comedy Hour displayed the charismatic energy between the team and established their popularity nationwide. By 1951, with an appearance at New York’s Paramount Theater (New York City) Paramount Theater, they were a cultural phenomenon, attracting crowds rivaled only by Frank Sinatra earlier (a friend of Lewis and Martin) and later by other stars Elvis Presley and The Beatles.

The duo began their Paramount Pictures Paramount film careers as ensemble players in My Friend Irma (film) My Friend Irma (1949), based on the My Friend Irma (radio-TV) radio series of the same name, and its sequel My Friend Irma Goes West (1950). Starting with At War with the Army (1950), Martin and Lewis were the stars of their own vehicles in fourteen additional titles, Thats My Boy (1951 film) Thats My Boy (1951), Sailor Beware (1952 film) Sailor Beware (1952), Jumping Jacks (1952), The Stooge (1952), Scared Stiff (1953 film) Scared Stiff (1953), The Caddy (1953), Money from Home (1953), Living It Up (1954), 3 Ring Circus (1954), Youre Never Too Young (1955), Artists and Models (1955) and Pardners (1956) ending with Hollywood or Bust (1956). All 16 films were produced by Hal B. Wallis.

They also starred as cameos in Bing Crosby and Bob Hopes film Road to Bali (1952).  Attesting to the duos popularity, DC Comics published The Adventures of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis from 1952 to 1957. In 1954, the team appeared on episode 191 of Whats My Line? as mystery guests, appeared on the 27th annual Academy Awards in 1955 and then appeared on The Steve Allen Show and The Today Show in 1956.

The Martin and Lewis films were reliable financial successes for Paramount, and hugely popular with audiences. In later years, both Lewis and Martin admitted frustration, and were critical of Wallis for his formulaic and trite film choices, restricting them to narrow, repetitive roles. As Martins roles in their films became less important over time, Lewis receiving the majority of critical acclaim, the partnership came under strain.

Martins participation became an embarrassment in 1954 when Look (American magazine) Look magazine published a publicity photo of the team for the magazine cover but cropped Martin out.<ref>{{cite news last=Clark first=Mike title=Dean & Me really is a love story url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2005-10-25-dean-and-me_x.htm access-date=January 15, 2013 newspaper=usatoday.com date=October 25, 2005}}</ref> The partnership ended with their final nightclub act on July 24, 1956 (the team’s 10th anniversary of their debut as a duo). Both Martin and Lewis went on to highly successful solo careers, and neither would comment on the split nor consider a reunion. However, they would occasionally be seen at the same public events.

===Going solo===

====Late 1950s====
====Nightclubs and recordings====
After his partnership with Martin ended in 1956, Lewis and his wife Patty took a vacation in Las Vegas to consider the direction of his career. He felt his life was in a crisis state: "I was unable to put one foot in front of the other with any confidence. I was completely unnerved to be alone".<ref name=Lewis /> While there, he received an urgent request from his friend Sidney Luft Sid Luft, who was Judy Garlands husband and manager, saying that she couldnt perform that night in Las Vegas because of Streptococcal pharyngitis strep throat,<ref name=Lewis /> and asking Lewis to fill in.

Lewis had not sung alone on stage since he was five years old, twenty-five years before, but he appeared before the audience of a thousand nonetheless, delivering jokes and clowning with the audience while Garland sat off-stage, watching. He then sang a rendition of a song hed learned as a child, "Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody" along with "Come Rain or Come Shine." Lewis recalled, "When I was done, the place exploded. I walked off the stage knowing I could make it on my own".<ref name=Lewis />

At his wifes pleading, Lewis used his own money to record the songs on a Single (music) single.<ref>{{cite web url=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RfVeOpw-NPY/hqdefault.jpg title=Image of record cover for Jerry Lewis single recording of "Rock-A-Bye Baby" publisher=}}</ref> Record company Capitol Records heard it, liked it and insisted he record an album for them.<ref name=Muncie>"Jerry Lewis Goes Over in a Big Way," The Star Press (Muncie, Indiana), Dec. 2, 1956, p. 23</ref> The single of Rock-a-Bye Your Baby went to #10 and the album Jerry Lewis Just Sings went to #3 on the Billboard charts, staying near the top for four months and selling a million and a half copies.<ref name=Lewis /><ref name=Lewis2>Lewis, Jerry. [https://jolsonville.net/2011/03/24/rock-a-bye-helps-jerry-lewis-become-a-singer/ "Rock-a-Bye helps Jerry Lewis become a singer"]</ref> With the success of that album he recorded the additional albums More Jerry Lewis (an EP of songs from this release was released as Somebody Loves Me), and Jerry Lewis Sings Big Songs For Little People (later reissued with fewer tracks as Jerry Lewis Sings For Children). Non-album singles were released, and It All Depends On You, hit the charts in April and May 1957, but peaked at only #68. Further singles were recorded and released by Lewis into the mid-1960s.

But these were not Lewiss first foray into recording, nor his first appearance on the hit charts. During his partnership with Martin, they made several recordings together, charting at #22 in 1948 with the 1920s chestnut That Certain Party and later mostly re-recording songs highlighted in their films. Also during the time of their partnership, but without Martin, he recorded numerous novelty-comedy numbers for adults as well as records specifically intended for the childrens market.

Having proven he could sing and do live shows, he began performing regularly at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, beginning in late 1956, which marked a turning point in his life and career. The Sands signed him for five years, to perform six weeks each year and paid him the same amount they had paid Martin and Lewis as a team.<ref name=Muncie /> The critics gave him positive reviews: "Jerry was wonderful. He has proved that he can be a success by himself," wrote one.<ref name=Muncie /> He continued with club performances in Miami, New York, Chicago and Washington. Such live performances became a staple of his career and over the years he performed at casinos, theaters, and state-fairs coast-to-coast.

In February 1957, he followed Garland at the Palace Theatre (Albany, New York) Palace Theater in New York and his ex-partner Martin called during this period to wish him the best of luck.<ref name=Muncie /> "Ive never been happier," said Lewis. "I have peace of mind for the first time."<ref name=Muncie />

====Television and movies====
Lewis established himself as a solo act on television starting with the first of six appearances on Whats My Line? from 1956 to 1966. He made guest appearances on both Tonight Starring Jack Paar and The Ed Sullivan Show and, beginning in January 1957, in a number of solo TV specials for NBC. He starred in his adaptation of "The Jazz Singer" for Startime. Lewis hosted the Academy Awards three times, in 1956, 1957 and the 31st Academy Awards in 1959, which ran twenty minutes short, forcing Lewis to improvise to fill time.<ref>{{cite web url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=2riKdGOdU3E title=Jerry Lewis Ad Libs at the Oscars first= last=1959 Academy Awards date=1959 publisher=The Oscars via=YouTube}}</ref> DC Comics, switching from Martin and Lewis, published a new comic book series titled The Adventures of Jerry Lewis, running from 1957 to 1971.

Lewis remained at Paramount and became a comedy star in his own right. His first solo movie was The Delicate Delinquent (1957), marking Lewis debut as film producer and screenwriter. It had been planned as the next Martin and Lewis film.
Martin and Lewis had made two films with director Frank Tashlin, whose background as a Looney Tunes cartoon director suited Lewis brand of humor. On his own, Lewis then made six more films with Tashlin starting with Rock-A-Bye Baby (film) Rock-A-Bye Baby (1958), and The Geisha Boy (1958). He also made The Sad Sack (1957), Dont Give Up the Ship (film) Dont Give Up The Ship (1959), and played Itchy McRabbitt, an uncredited role in Lil Abner (1959 film) Lil Abner (1959).

By the end of his contract with producer Hal B. Wallis, Lewis had several productions of his own under his belt and was eager to flex his creative muscle. As a solo, Lewis was free to deepen his comedy with pathos, believing, “Funny without pathos is a pie in the face. And a pie in the face is funny, but I wanted more.”

====Paramount contract====
In 1959, a contract between Paramount and Jerry Lewis Productions (Lewis production company) was signed specifying a payment of $10&nbsp;million plus 60% of the profits for 14 films over a seven-year period.<ref>{{cite book  last=Krutnik first=Frank  title=Inventing Jerry Lewis  publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press  year=2000  page=105  isbn=978-1560983699}}</ref> This contract made Lewis the highest paid individual Hollywood talent to date and was unprecedented in that he had unlimited creative control, including final cut, and the return of film rights after 30 years. Lewis’ clout and box office were so strong, the head of production at Paramount at that time, Barney Balaban told the press, “If Jerry wants to burn down the studio I’ll give him the match!”<ref>{{cite web url= http://www.wearemoviegeeks.com/2014/01/method-madness-jerry-lewis-dvd-review/ title=Method to The Maddess of Jerry Lewis the DVD Review first=Sam last=Moffitt date=January 20, 2014 publisher=wearemoviegeeks.com}}</ref>

====1960s and emergence as director====

The movie was postponed for a Christmas 1960 release. Paramount Pictures, needing a quickie motion picture for its summer 1960 schedule, held Lewis to his contract to produce one.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jerry-lewis-dead-nutty-professor-bellboy-star-was-91-721408 title=Jerry Lewis, Nonpareil Genius of Comedy, Dies at 91 work=The Hollywood Reporter access-date=2017-08-20 language=en}}</ref>

Lewis followed The Bellboy by directing several more films he co-wrote with Richmond, including The Ladies Man (1961), where Lewis constructed a three-story dollhouse-like set spanning two sound stages.

Lewis then directed, co-wrote and starred with Stella Stevens in the smash hit The Nutty Professor (1963). A parody of Robert Louis Stevensons The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, it featured Lewis as a socially awkward professor inventing a serum that turns him into a handsome but obnoxious ladies man. It is largely considered to be Lewis’ finest and most memorable film. In 2004, the movie was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". Lewis took time from shooting to film a cameo role in Stanley Kramers comedy epic Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963).

He starred next in Tashlins Whos Minding the Store? (1963) and then hosted The Jerry Lewis Show, a 13-week lavish, big-budget show for American Broadcasting Company ABC, that aired from September to December in 1963. The show suffered in the ratings, beleaguered by technical and other difficulties, including the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which left the country in a somber mood. Lewis co-wrote and starred in The Patsy (1964 film) The Patsy (1964), his satire about the Hollywood star-making industry.

====Reunion with Martin====
In September 1976, Frank Sinatra shocked Lewis by bringing Dean Martin on stage during the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. As Martin and Lewis embraced, the audience cheered and the phones lit up, resulting in one of the telethons most profitable years. Lewis reported the event was one of the three most memorable of his life. Lewis quipped, "So, you working?", which he stated was a call-back to a remark he’d made to Martin when they first met.

Martin, playing drunk, replied that he was "at the Meggum" (meaning the MGM Grand Las Vegas MGM Grand). The reunion made international headlines and is considered one of the most iconic moments in television history.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/09/dean-martin-jerry-lewis-reunion-anniversary title=When Jerry Met Dean-Again, on Live Television first=Donald last=Liebenson date=September 2016 publisher=Vanity Fair}}</ref> Less well known, Lewis returned the surprise the following year by walking onto the Planet Hollywood Las Vegas Aladdin stage in Las Vegas during Martin and Sinatra’s performance.

This was necessary since he was acting as well as directing. His techniques and methods of video assist, documented in his book and his USC class, enabled him to complete most of his films on time and under budget since reshoots could take place immediately instead of waiting for the dailies.

==USC film class==
Starting in 1967, Lewis taught a film directing class at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles for a number of years. His students included George Lucas, whose friend Steven Spielberg sometimes sat in on classes.<ref>Jerry Lewis: TV Guide Biography</ref>  Lewis screened Spielbergs early film Amblin and told his students, "Thats what filmmaking is all about."<ref>{{cite book author=Joseph McBride title=Steven Spielberg – A Biography location=New York publisher=Simon & Schuster year=1997 page=168 isbn=978-1604738360}}</ref> The class covered all topics related to filmmaking, including pre and post production, marketing and distribution, and filming comedy with rhythm and timing.<ref>{{cite book title=The Total Filmmaker first=Jerry last=Lewis year=1971 publisher=Random House isbn=9780446669269}}</ref> His book The Total Film Maker (1971), was based on 480 hours of his class lectures.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.mda.org/jerry-lewis/biography.html title=Jerry Lewis Biography publisher=MDA.org}}</ref>

==French critical acclaim==
While Lewis was popular in France for his duo films with partner Dean Martin and his solo comedy films, his reputation and stature increased after the Paramount contract, when he began to exert total control over all aspects of his films.  His involvement in directing, writing, editing and art direction coincided with the rise of auteur auteur theory in French intellectual film criticism and the French New Wave movement. He earned consistent praise from French critics in the influential magazines Cahiers du Cinéma and Positif (magazine) Positif, where he was hailed as an ingenious auteur.

His singular mise-en-scene, and skill behind the camera, were aligned with Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock and Satyajit Ray. Appreciated too, was the complexity of his also being in front of the camera. The new French criticism viewed Cinematography cinema as an art form unto itself, and comedy as part of this art. Lewis is then fitted into a historical context and seen as not only worthy of critique, but as an innovator and satirist of his time.<ref>{{cite book title=The Film first=Hollis last=Alpert chapter=le roi du crazy publisher=The Bobbs-Merrill Co., Inc. location=New York pages=23–25 year=1968}}</ref> Jean-Pierre Coursodon states in a 1975 Film Comment article, “The merit of the French critics, auteurist excesses notwithstanding, was their willingness to look at what Lewis was doing as a filmmaker for what it was, rather than with some preconception of what film comedy should be.”

Not yet curricula at universities or art schools, Film studies Cinema Studies and Film theory were avant-garde in early 1960s America. Mainstream movie reviewers such as Pauline Kael, were dismissive of auteur theory, and others, seeing only absurdist comedy, criticized Lewis for his ambition and “castigated him for his self-indulgence” and egotism.<ref name="Mclellen">{{cite web url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-jerry-lewis-20170820-story.html title=The Slapstick, The Telethons, The Laaady! first=Dennis last=Mclellen date=August 20, 2017 publisher=LA Times}}</ref> “The total film-maker, so admired in France, made Hollywood uncomfortable, since the system has always operated otherwise.”

Appreciation of Lewis became a misunderstood stereotype about “the French”, and it was often the object of jokes in American pop culture.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1349/do-the-french-really-love-jerry-lewis title=Do the French really love Jerry Lewis? date=October 1, 1999 publisher=The Straight Dope author=Cecil Adams access-date=May 4, 2015}}</ref> "That Americans cant see Jerry Lewis genius is bewildering," says N. T. Binh, a French film magazine critic. Such bewilderment was the basis of the book Why the French Love Jerry Lewis.<ref name=Poirier /> In a lingering perception that French audiences adored him, Lewis stated in interviews he was more popular in Germany, Japan and Australia.

==Activism with MDA==
File:Mda2018logo.png thumb 200px right
Throughout his adult life and career, Lewis was a world-renowned humanitarian and "number one volunteer" who supported fundraising for research into muscular dystrophy. From 1956 to 2011, he served as national chairman of and spokesman for the Muscular Dystrophy Association (formerly, the Muscular Dystrophy Associations of America).<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.msnbc.com/id/44013800/ns/us_news-giving/#.TjqwhTvj6rg title=Jerry Lewis no longer MDAs national chairman publisher=MSNBC date=August 4, 2011}}</ref> As early as December 1951, Lewis, with his comedy partner Martin, made appeals for MDA at the conclusion of The Colgate Comedy Hour. 

He began hosting New York area telethons to benefit the organization from 1952 to 1959, leading to the live annual Labor Day event of The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon (also referred to as Jerry Lewis Extra Special Special, Jerry Lewis Super Show and Jerry Lewis Stars Across America), which ran from 1966 to 2010. 
In 1977, Lewis was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on behalf of the Muscular Dystrophy Association.

By 1990, popular culture had shifted its view of the differently-abled and the telethon format. Lewis and the telethon’s methods were criticized by disabled-rights activists who believed the show was “designed to evoke pity rather than empower the disabled.” <ref>{{cite web url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-09-03/news/0609030039_1_muscular-dystrophy-jerry-lewis-telethon first=E.A. last=Torriero title=Telethon Raises Criticism date=September 3, 2006 publisher=Baltimore Sun}}</ref> The activists said the telethon perpetuated prejudices and stereotypes, that Lewis treated those he claimed to be helping with little respect, and that he used offensive language when describing them.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/08/21/jerry-lewis-telethons-raised-billions-for-muscular-dystrophy-many-cheered-when-he-went-off-the-air/?utm_term=.ca0ea8947e40 first=Travis last=Andrews title=Jerry Lewis Telethons Raised Billion For Muscular Dystrophy Many Cheered When He Went Off The Air date=August 21, 2017 publisher=The Washington Post}}</ref> Lewis rebutted the criticism and defended his methods saying, “If you dont tug at their heartstrings, then youre on the air for nothing."

In 1998, Lewis telethon became the first ever to be viewed around the globe via internet simulcast by RealNetworks on MDAs website. In 2009, Lewis was presented the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for his efforts for MDA. On August 3, 2011, it was announced that Lewis would no longer host the MDA telethons<ref>{{cite news title=Jerry Lewis Dropped from Labor Day Telethon author=Brian Stelter date=August 4, 2011 url=http://artbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/jerry-lewis-dropped-from-labor-day-telethon newspaper=The New York Times access-date=May 3, 2015}}</ref> and that he was no longer associated with the Muscular Dystrophy Association.<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.showbiz411.com/2014/07/27/jerry-lewis-screwed-again-by-mda-theyre-using-his-old-clips-with-a-list-stars-to-promote-themselves title=Jerry Lewis Screwed Again by MDA: Theyre Using His Old Clips With A List Stars to Promote Themselves publisher=Showbiz411 date=July 27, 2014 access-date=2014-08-23}}</ref> Then on May 1, 2015, it was announced that in view of "the new realities of television viewing and philanthropic giving", the telethon was being discontinued.<ref>{{cite magazine agency=Associated Press  magazine=The Hollywood Reporter url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/labor-day-telethon-jerry-lewis-792831 title=Labor Day Telethon That Jerry Lewis Memorably Ran Pulls Plug date=May 1, 2015 issn=0018-3660}}</ref>

In early 2016, Lewis broke a five-year silence by making a surprise online video statement at MDAs brand re-launch event at Carnegie Hall in New York City for the organization on its website in honor of its rebranding marking his first (and as it turned out, his final) appearance in support of MDA since his last telethon in 2010 and the end of his tenure as national chairman and spokesman in 2011.{{citation needed date=September 2017}}

For over half a century, Lewis raised an estimated $2.6 billion in donations for the cause.<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/06/24/3252231.htm title=Jerry Lewis wows ACTU crowd publisher=ABC News date=June 24, 2011}}</ref> MDA’s website states, “Jerry’s love, passion and brilliance are woven throughout this organization, which he helped build from the ground up. Lewis courted sponsors for MDA, appeared at openings of MDA care and research centers, addressed meetings of civic organizations, volunteers and the MDA Board of Directors, successfully lobbied Congress for federal neuromuscular disease research funds and made countless phone calls and visits to families served by MDA.

During Lewis’ lifetime, MDA-funded scientists discovered the causes of most of the diseases in the Muscular Dystrophy Association’s program, developing treatments, therapies and standards of care that have allowed many people living with these diseases to live longer and grow stronger.”<ref>{{cite web url=https://strongly.mda.org/in-loving-memory-of-jerry-lewis/ first= last= title=In Loving Memory of Jerry Lewis-MDA publisher=MDA.org}}</ref> Over 200 research and treatment facilities were built with donations raised by the Jerry Lewis Telethons.

==Theater chain==
In 1969, Lewis agreed to lend his name to "Jerry Lewis Cinemas", offered by National Cinema Corporation as a franchise business opportunity for those interested in theatrical movie exhibition. Jerry Lewis Cinemas stated that their theaters could be operated by a staff of as few as two with the aid of automation and support provided by the franchiser in booking film and other aspects of film exhibition. A forerunner of the smaller rooms typical of later multi-screen complexes, a Jerry Lewis Cinema was billed in franchising ads as a "mini-theatre" with a seating capacity of between 200 and 350. In addition to Lewiss name, each Jerry Lewis Cinemas bore a sign with a cartoon logo of Lewis in profile.<ref>{{cite news last=Connelly first=Sherilyn title=Bad Ideas from the 1970s: Jerry Lewis Cinema Franchises Were a Nutty Disaster url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2011/08/jerry_lewis_cinemas_the_nutty.php newspaper=SF Weekly access-date=October 19, 2011}}</ref> Initially 158 territories were franchised, with a buy-in fee of $10,000 or $15,000 depending on the territory, for what was called an "individual exhibitor".

For $50,000, Jerry Lewis Cinemas offered an opportunity known as an "area directorship", in which investors controlled franchising opportunities in a territory as well as their own cinemas.<ref>{{cite news url=https://books.google.com/books?id8z8EAAAAMBAJ&1pg=PP1&rview=1&pg=PA75-IA4#v=onepage&q&f=false work=Life title=Join Jerry Lewis (advt.) page=75 date=December 31, 1971 access-date=2011-10-23}}</ref> The success of the chain was hampered by a policy of only booking second-run, family-friendly films. Eventually the policy was changed, and the Jerry Lewis Cinemas were allowed to show more competitive movies. But after a decade the chain failed and both Lewis and National Cinema Corporation declared bankruptcy in 1980.<ref>{{cite news last=ccrouch title=Fantasy & Failure With Jerry Lewis Cinemas url=http://cinelog.org/cinelog/2009/03/28/fantasy-failure-with-jerry-lewis-cinemas/ publisher=Cinelog.org access-date=October 19, 2011}}</ref>

==Other charity work==
In 1990, Lewis wrote and directed a short film for UNICEFs How Are The Children? anthology exploring the rights of children worldwide. The eight-minute segment, titled Boy, was about a young white child in a black world and being subjected to quiet, insidious racism, and outright racist bullying.<ref>{{Cite book url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6XuCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA452&lpg=PA452 title=King of Comedy: The Life and Art of Jerry Lewis last=Levy first=Shawn date=1996 publisher=Macmillan isbn=9780312132484 language=en}}</ref>

In 2010, Lewis met with seven-year-old Lochie Graham, who shared his idea for "Jerrys House", a place for vulnerable and traumatized children. Lewis and Graham entered into a joint partnership for an Australian and a U.S.-based charity and began raising funds to build the facility in Melbourne, Australia.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader//outer-east/ringwood-east-teen-lochie-graham-bands-with-comedian-jerry-lewis-to-create-a-house-full-of-laughter/news-story/c7c7ad1847d30dd2751d3fa90d956a51 title=Laughter really is the best medicine publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.hope2day.org/jerrys-house/ title=jerryshouse website=jerryshouse}}</ref>

On September 12, 2016, Lewis lent his name and star power to Criss Angels HELP (Heal Every Life Possible) charity event.

==Political views==
Lewis kept a low political profile for many years, having taken advice reportedly given to him by President John F. Kennedy, who told him "Dont get into anything political. Dont do that because they will usurp your energy".<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/doug-elfman/how-jack-kennedy-talked-jerry-lewis-out-500-million-charity-loan archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924005840/http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/doug-elfman/how-jack-kennedy-talked-jerry-lewis-out-500-million-charity-loan archivedate=2016-09-24 title=How Jack Kennedy Talked Jerry Lewis Out Of A $500 Million Charity Loan first=Doug last=Elfman date=August 31, 2008 access-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> Nevertheless, he campaigned and performed on behalf of both JFK and Robert F. Kennedy. Lewis was a supporter of the African-American civil rights movement (1954-1968) Civil Rights Movement. For his 1957 NBC special, Lewis held his ground when southern affiliates objected to his stated friendship with Sammy Davis Jr. In a 1971 Movie Mirror magazine article, Lewis came out against the Vietnam War, when his son, Gary, returned from service traumatized.  He vowed to leave the country rather than send another of his sons. 
 
Lewis once stated political speeches should not be at the Academy Awards Oscars. “I think we are the most dedicated industry in the world. And I think that we have to present ourselves that night as hard-working, caring and important people to the industry. We need to get more self-respect as an industry”.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jerry-lewis-talks-hollywood-argo-424974 title=Jerry Lewis on Argo, Old Hollywood and his Fans in France publisher= access-date=December 20, 2016 via=The Guardian}}</ref>
In a 2004 interview with The Guardian, Lewis was asked what he was least proud of, to which he answered, “Politics”. Not his politics, but the worlds politics – the madness, the destruction, the general lack of respect. He lamented citizens lack of patriotism pride in their country, stating, "President George W. Bush Bush is my president. I will not say anything negative about the president of the United States. I dont do that. And I dont allow my children to do that. Likewise when I come to England dont you do any jokes about Mum to me. That is the Elizabeth II Queen of England, you moron." “Do you know how tough a job it is to be the Queen of England?”<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/apr/08/1 title=My dream is to be perfect first=Simon last=Hattenstone date=April 8, 2004 publisher= access-date=December 20, 2016 work=The Guardian}}</ref>

In a December 2015 interview on EWTNs World Over with Raymond Arroyo, Lewis expressed opposition to the United States letting in Refugees of the Syrian Civil War Syrian refugees, saying "No one has worked harder for the human condition than I have, but theyre not part of the human condition if 11 guys in that group of 10,000 are Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ISIS. How can I take that chance?"<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.liberty.news/2016-01-15-jerry-lewis-unleashed-acclaimed-comedian-slams-obamas-destructive-policies-while-praising-donald-trump.html title=Jerry Lewis unleashed: Acclaimed comedian slams Obamas destructive policies while praising Donald Trump website=www.liberty.news}}</ref> In the same interview, he criticized President Barack Obama for not being prepared for ISIS, while expressing support for Donald Trump, saying he would make a good president because he was a good "showman".

===Controversial statements===

In 1998, at the The Comedy Festival Aspen U.S. Comedy Arts Festival, when asked which women comics he admired, Lewis answered, “I don’t like any female comedians.” “A woman doing comedy doesn’t offend me but sets me back a bit.” <ref>{{cite web url=https://people.com/celebrity/jerry-lewis-not-funny/ title=Jerry Lewis: Not Funny date=October 29, 1998 first= last=People staff publisher=People Magazine}}</ref>  He later clarified his statements saying, “Seeing a woman project the kind of aggression that you have to project as a comic just rubs me wrong.” “I cannot sit and watch a lady diminish her qualities to the lowest common denominator.” Lewis mentioned his attitude as that of an older generation and said women are funny but not in ‘broad’ and ‘crude’ humor.

He went on to praise Lucille Ball as "brilliant" and said Carol Burnett is "the greatest female entrepreneur of comedy."  On other occasions Lewis expressed admiration for female comedians Totie Fields, Phyllis Diller, Kathleen Freeman, Elayne Boosler, Whoopi Goldberg and Tina Fey. During the 2007 MDA Telethon, Lewis used an anti-gay slur on-air for which he apologized. He said the same slur the following year on Australian television.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/08/20/the-two-sides-of-jerry-lewis/ title=Appreciation: The Two Sides of Jerry Lewis publisher=The Washington Post date=August 20, 2017 first=Elahe last=Izadi}}</ref>

It was discovered that he had pneumonia, as well as a severely damaged heart. He underwent a cardiac catheterization{{when date=November 2017}} and two stents were inserted into one of his coronary arteries, which was 90 percent blocked. The surgery resulted in increased blood flow to his heart and allowed him to continue his rebound from earlier lung problems. Having the cardiac catheterization meant canceling several major events from his schedule, but Lewis fully recuperated in a matter of weeks. In 1999, Lewis Australian tour was cut short when he had to be hospitalized in Darwin, Northern Territory Darwin with viral meningitis.{{citation needed date=November 2017}} He was ill for more than five months. It was reported in the Australian press that he had failed to pay his medical bills. However, Lewis maintained that the payment confusion was the fault of his health insurer.

The resulting negative publicity caused him to sue his insurer for US$100&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news  last=Price  first=Jenna  date=June 11, 2000  title=Jerry Lewis Calls The Shots Now That Hes Paid His Bill  newspaper=The Canberra Times}}</ref> Lewis had prostate cancer,<ref>{{cite news  last=Henkel first=John title=Prostate Cancer: New Tests Create Treatment Dilemmas url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_n10_v28/ai_15955600/ archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708120551/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_n10_v28/ai_15955600/  dead-url= yes archive-date= 2012-07-08 date=December 1994 work=FDA Consumer publisher= BNET access-date=2009-06-16}}</ref> Diabetes mellitus type 1 type 1 diabetes,<ref name="seattlepi" /><ref>{{cite web work=The Hollywood Reporter url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/jerry-lewis-opens-up-sons-709775 date=6 June 2014 author=Feinberg, Scott title=At Home With Jerry Lewis as He Opens Up About Sons Death, Skirmishes With Fans accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref> pulmonary fibrosis,<ref name="usat" /> and a decades-long history of cardiovascular disease.

He had suddenly become unwell, apparently with heart problems.{{citation needed date=November 2017}}

He was subsequently taken to the hospital. Some months thereafter, Lewis began an arduous, months-long therapy that weaned him off prednisone and enabled him to return to work. On June 12, 2012, he was treated and released from a hospital after collapsing from hypoglycemia at a New York Friars Club event.

==Tributes and legacy==
For almost two decades, from the late 40s to the mid-60s, Lewis was a virtually unprecedented force in American popular culture.<ref>{{cite magazine title=Here at Last--A Serious Life of Jerry Lewis author=Bruce Handy publisher=Time Magazine page=180 date=July 29, 1996}}</ref> Widely acknowledged as a comic genius, Lewis influenced successive generations of comedians, comedy writers, performers and filmmakers.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/20/arts/jerry-lewis-critic-comedians-influence.html title=For Jerry Lewis Few Statuettes But Lots of Influence first=Neil last=Genzlinger date=August 20, 2017 publisher=NY Times}}</ref> Often referenced as the bridge from Vaudeville to modern comedy, Carl Reiner wrote after Lewis’ death, “All comedians watch other comedians, and every generation of comedians going back to those who watched Jerry on the Colgate Comedy Hour were influenced by Jerry. They say that mankind goes back to the first guy...which everyone tries to copy.

Even comics who never took a pratfall in their careers owe something to the self-deprecation Jerry introduced into American show business." <ref name="Mclellen"/>  His self-deprecating humor can be found in Larry David or David Letterman.

Lewis’ comedy style was physically uninhibited, expressive, and potentially volatile. He was known especially for his distinctive voice, facial expressions, pratfalls, and physical stunts. His improvisations and ad-libbing, especially in nightclubs and early television, were revolutionary among performers. It was “marked by a raw, edgy energy that would distinguish him within the comedy landscape.” <ref>{{cite web url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/20/16176098/jerry-lewis-comedian-filmmaker-obituary title=Jerry Lewis, Legendary Standup, Actor-Director, and comedy Misanthrope, is Dead at 91 first=Aja last=Romano date=August 20, 2017 publisher=vox.com}}</ref>  Will Sloan, of Flavorwire wrote, “In the late ‘40s and early ‘50s, nobody had ever seen a comedian as wild as Jerry Lewis.”<ref>{{cite web url=http://flavorwire.com/563565/pure-unfiltered-id-reappraising-jerry-lewis-brutally-unfunny-comedy title=Pure Unfiltered Id Reappraising Jerry Lewis first=Will last=Sloan date=March 1, 2016 publisher=Flavorwire}}</ref> Placed in the context of the conservative era, his antics were radical and liberating, paving the way for future comedians Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Andy Kaufman, Paul Reubens, and Jim Carrey.

Acting the bumbling and stammering ‘everyman’, Lewis used tightly choreographed, sophisticated sight gags, physical routines, verbal double-talk and malapropisms. “You cannot help but notice Lewis incredible sense of control in regards to performing—they may have looked at times like the ravings of a madman but his best work had a genuine grace and finesse behind it that would put most comedic performers of any era to shame.”<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/an-american-original-the-rogerebertcom-staff-remembers-jerry-lewis first=Peter last=Sobczynski title=An American Original The RogerEbert.com Staff Remembers Jerry Lewis date=August 22, 2017 publisher=rogerebert.com}}</ref>  They are “choreographed as exactly as any ballet, each movement and gesture coming on natural beats and conforming to the overall rhythmic form which is headed to a spectacular finale: absolute catastrophe.”<ref>{{cite web url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2016/jerry-lewis/jerry-lewis-the-fool/ title=Deconstruction Jerry: Lewis as Director: Some Basic Characteristics of the Fool first=Alan last=Finney ed. publisher=Melbourne Film Bulletin date=April 1070}}</ref>

Lewis’ work, specifically his self-directed films, have warranted steady reappraisal. Richard Brody in The New Yorker said, Lewis was “one of the most original, inventive, ...profound directors of the time.”<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/postscript-jerry-lewis first=Richard last=Brody title=Postscript: Jerry Lewis date=August 29, 2017 publisher=The New Yorker}}</ref> and “one of the most skilled and original comic performers, verbal and physical, ever to appear on screen.” Film critic and film curator for the Museum of Modern Art, Dave Kehr wrote in The New York Times  of Lewis’ “fierce creativity”, “the extreme formal sophistication of his direction” and, Lewis was “....one of the great American filmmakers.” {{quote box  align=right width=30em bgcolor=Cornsilk quote=“As a filmmaker who insisted on the personal side of his work—who was producer, writer, director, star, and over-all boss of his productions in the interest of his artistic conception and passion—he was an auteur by temperament and in practice long before the word travelled Stateside.” source=The New Yorker, 2017 first=Richard last=Brody}} “Lewis was an explosive experimenter with a dazzling skill, and an audacious, innovatory flair for the technique of the cinema. He knew how to frame and present his own adrenaline-fuelled, instinctive physical comedy for the camera.”<ref>{{cite web url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/aug/20/jerry-lewis-a-knockabout-clown-with-a-dark-and-melancholy-inner-life first=Peter last=Bradshaw date=August 21, 2017 title=Jerry Lewis, a Knockabout Clown with a Dark and Melancholy Inner Life publisher=The Guardian}}</ref>

Lewis was in the forefront in the transition to independent filmmaking, which came to be known as New Hollywood in the late 1960s. Writing for the Los Angeles Times in 2005, screenwriter David Weddle lauded Lewis’ audacity in 1959 “daring to declare his independence from the studio system.”<ref>{{cite web url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/27/magazine/tm-lewis09 title=Jerry Lewis Is a Brilliant Comic Artis, a Technically Innovative Filmmaker and an Enduring Creative Influence in Hollywood first=David last=Weddle publisher=LA Times}}</ref> Lewis came along to a studio system in which the industry was regularly stratified between players and coaches.  The studios tightly controlled the process and they wanted their people directing. Yet Lewis regularly led, often flouting the power structure to do so. 
Control over material was smart business, and it was also good art. Neither the entrepreneur nor the auteur were common types among actors in mid-20th century Hollywood. But there Lewis was, at a time of strict studio control, doing both.
<ref>{{cite web title=An appreciation: Jerry Lewis helped write the auteurs playbook first=Steven  last=Zeitchikhttp url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-mn-jerry-lewis-legacy-20170820-story.html date=August 20, 2017}}</ref> 

No other comedic star, with the exception of Charlie Chaplin Chaplin in the  silent film silent era, dared to direct himself.  “Not only would Lewis’ efforts as a director pave the way for the likes of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen, but it would reveal him to be uncommonly skilled in that area as well.” “Most screen comedies until that time were not especially cinematic—they tended to plop down the camera where it could best capture the action and that was it.

Few comedians before him had so brazenly turned arrested development into art, or held up such a warped fun house mirror to American identity in its loudest, ugliest, vulgarest excesses. Fewer still had advanced the still-radical notion that comedy doesn’t always have to be funny, just fearless, in order to strike a nerve“.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-jerry-lewis-appreciation-film-20170821-story.html title=Jerry Lewis, The Movie’s Mad and Mercerial Comic Genius first=Justin last=Chang authorlink=Justin Chang date=August 21, 2017 publisher=LA Times}}</ref>

Pre 1960, Hollywood comedies were screwball comedy film screwball or farce. Lewis, from his earliest home movies, such as How to Smuggle a Hernia Across the Border, made in his playhouse in the early 1950s, was one of the first to introduce satire as a full-length film. This “sharp eyed” satire continued in his mature work, commenting on the cult of celebrity, the machinery of ‘fame’, and “the dilemma of being true to oneself while also fitting into polite society.” Stephen Dalton in The Hollywood Reporter wrote, Lewis had “an agreeably bitter streak, offering self-lacerating insights into celebrity culture which now look strikingly modernism modern. Even postmodernity post-modern in places.” Speaking of The King of Comedy, “More contemporary satirists like Garry Shandling, Steve Coogan and Ricky Gervais owe at least some of their self-deconstructing chops to Lewis generously unappetizing turn in Scorseses cult classic.”<ref>{{cite web url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/critics-notebook-jerry-lewis-a-comic-genius-by-turns-sweet-bitter-1031194 first=Stephen last=Dalton title=Critics Notebook: Jerry Lewis a Comic Genius by Turns Sweet and Bitter work=The Hollywood Reporter date=August 21, 2017}}</ref>

Lewis was an early master of  deconstruction to enhance comedy. From the first Comedy Hours he exposed the artifice of on stage performance by acknowledging the lens, sets, malfunctioning props, failed jokes, and tricks of production. As Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote:  Lewis had “the impulse to deconstruct and even demolish the fictional “givens” of any particular sketch, including those that he might have dreamed up himself, a kind of perpetual auto-destruction that becomes an essential part of his filmmaking as he steadily gains more control over the writing and direction of his features.”<ref>{{cite web url= https://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2017/06/the-lewis-contradiction/ title=The Lewis Contradiction first=Jonathan last=Rosenbaum date=October 2013 publisher=Viennale Catalogue}}</ref> His self directed films abound in behind-the-scene reveals, demystifying movie-making. Daniel Fairfax writes in Deconstructing Jerry: Lewis as a Director, “Lewis deconstructs the very functioning of the joke itself”....quoting Chris Fujiwara, “The Patsy (1964 film) The Patsy is a film so radical that it makes comedy out of the situation of a comedian who isn’t funny.”<ref>{{cite web url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2016/jerry-lewis/jerry-lewis-as-director title=Deconstrucing Jerry: Lewis as Director first=Daniel last=Fairfax date=July 2016 publisher=sensesofcinema.com}}</ref> The final scene of The Patsy is famous for revealing to the audience the movie as a movie, and Lewis as actor/director.<ref>{{cite web url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/jerry-lewis-b-joseph-levitch-newark-new-jersey-1926-res-hollywood/ first=Michael last=Stern date=August 21, 2017 title=Jerry Lewis: b.

Robert DeNiro and Sandra Bernhard (both of whom starred with Lewis in The King of Comedy) reflected on his death, Bernhard said, "It was one of the great experiences of my career, he was tough but one of a kind”. De Niro said, "Jerry was a pioneer in comedy and film. And he was a friend. I was fortunate to have seen him a few times over the past couple of years. Even at 91, he didn’t miss a beat… or a punchline.
