==Personal life==
On April 16, 2010, Glass collapsed backstage at a Los Angeles comedy club after suffering a heart attack.
Glass appeared on The Bonnie Hunt Show only nine days later, talking about his recent "brush with death". Glass said he found out he had 100% blockage in his arteries and following an angioplasty, declared that he was doing fine.
Glass blamed these health problems on bad genetics. Both parents had a history of heart problems; Todds father had his first heart attack at age 30 and died of a subsequent heart attack at age 46.
On December 20, 2012, Glass talked about his heart attack on the The Adam Carolla Show (podcast) Adam Carolla Show, and said that he had lost 30 pounds since the incident.

Glass coming out came out publicly as gay on January 16, 2012, during an episode of fellow comedian Marc Marons  WTF with Marc Maron WTF podcast. The information had previously been known to friends and family, and Glass explained that he was worried about coming out publicly, but the recent string of suicide among LGBT youth motivated him to do so.
