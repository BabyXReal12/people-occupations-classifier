He is most well known from his time as a Segment Producer on TechTVs The Screen Savers and later as the host of his own late night talk show Unscrewed with Martin Sargent.

==Early life==
Sargent studied History and English studies English at the University of London, Cornell University and Syracuse University.

==Career==
Sargents first job after school was as an editor at PC/Computing magazine.<ref name="About WD">[http://revision3.com/index.php?show=webdrifter&showpage=about About Web Drifter-Martin Sargent]</ref>

In 1998, Sargent joined the ZDTV (later TechTV) television program TV show Call For Help as the shows "Resident Craft Professional" and substitute co-host.  In 2001, he moved from Call For Help to another TechTV show, The Screen Savers, and became known first as "The Twisted Lister", for producing and presenting odd, "twisted" top-five lists on the show, and later for another segment, "Site of the Night", in which he presented strange websites.

Sargent left The Screen Savers in April 2003, to host his own show, Unscrewed with Martin Sargent, anchoring a newly introduced late-night programming block.

On March 25, 2004, Comcasts G4 (U.S. TV channel) G4 gaming channel announced a merger with TechTV.  This move became hugely controversial among loyal fans of TechTV.  Around May 6, G4 announced the Termination (employment) termination of 250 employees from the San Francisco, California San Francisco office by July 10, 2004, allowing approximately 80 to 100 employees to transition to G4s main office in Los Angeles, California if they agreed to relocate there.<ref>[http://leoville.com/blog/index.php/TLR/comments/comcast_fires_techtv_staff/ Comcast Fires TechTV Staff]</ref>  Sargent chose to stay with G4 and moved to Los Angeles.

Six months later, on November 11, 2004, G4TechTV canceled Unscrewed and Termination of employment terminated Sargent, along with many other former co-workers from TechTV.<ref>[http://alexalbrecht.typepad.com/alex/g4techtv/index.html Alex Albrechts blog about the terminations]</ref>

Exactly one year after his termination, Sargent launched Infected by Martin Sargent Infected, a comedy podcast distributed by the internet production company Revision3. Infected was hosted by Sargent and "The Gator" (portrayed by co-writer Jay Speiden, who died in December 2016<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/martinsargent/posts/10157994469655171 Martin Sargents Facebook post about the death of Jay Speiden]</ref>), produced by Joey Rabier, and was structured as a conversation between co-hosts and producer, with fake "commercials" for various real and fictional products as well as occasional guest callers. Recurring callers included inventor Alex Chiu as well as the fictional characters Johnny OBanion (portrayed by co-writer/producer Stewart Engesser), a Hollywood reporter and former Loni Anderson paramour, and karate master Rickey Kang (also played by Spieden).  OBanion and Kang were recurring characters on Infected by Martin Sargent Infected, and Rabier acted as a production assistant on the show and also appeared as his "intern" character for selected skits.  The podcast was originally available in audio-only format, then offered an alternative video version consisting of a montage of still photographs relating to the topic discussed and taken at the recording session.  The video version has since been offered in full-motion video.  Infected was canceled in December 2007, after 50 episodes.

Sargent hosted Web Drifter<ref>[http://revision3.com/webdrifter/ Web Drifter website] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103001645/http://revision3.com/webdrifter  date=2007-01-03 }}</ref> and Internet Superstar on Revision3 and Why Today Sucked, on GoTV Networks "Laugh Riot" channel, available for video-enabled cell phones on the Sprint network.  Web Drifter began as a pilot originally pitched to Comedy Central, but it was picked up by Revision3 after the cable network passed on the show.<ref name="About WD"/>

On January 30, 2008, the Revision3 website released the first episode of Martin Sargents new show, Internet Superstar.

As of October 27, 2008 he was made redundant as part of Revision3 layoffs.<ref>{{cite tweet user=martinsargent author=Martin Sargent number=977886209 date=27 October 2008 title=Sad day Revision3. Internet Superstar canceled, cleaned out my desk. Thank you all for watching. Hope you enjoyed it 1/10 as much as I did.}}</ref> He has reappeared on Revision3 show The Digg Reel twice since he was laid off, once as acting co-host alongside Kevin Rose while regular host Andrew Bancroft was on vacation. In this appearance he expressed mock-anger that, as part of promotions within the show, other cancelled show Pixel Perfect has been revived, unlike his own shows. He appeared once more on The Digg Reels 100th episode, in which he jokingly stated that he secretly lived within the walls of the Revision3 building, resulting from his supposed inability to get another job.

Starting February 12, 2009, he and Sarah Lane appeared together in a Podcast on Leo Laportes TWiT.tv network called This Week in Fun.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.sarahlane.com/blog/category/this-week-in-fun  title=Archived copy  accessdate=2009-02-16  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202101824/http://www.sarahlane.com/blog/category/this-week-in-fun  archivedate=2013-02-02  df= }}</ref>  The show aired for just shy of a year before going on hiatus in January 2010, following Martins employment at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco.  The show was left on good terms with the TWiT network, though they have made no solid plans of returning to production.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.sarahlane.com/blog/2010/1/21/this-week-in-fun-hibernatin.html  title=Archived copy  accessdate=2010-02-15  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223003733/http://www.sarahlane.com/blog/2010/1/21/this-week-in-fun-hibernatin.html  archivedate=2010-02-23  df= }}</ref>

In November 2009, Martin and long-time associate Molly McDonald became engaged.<ref>{{cite tweet user=martinsargent author=Martin Sargent number=6119661171 date=27 November 2009 title=No, unlike the fact that onions will prevent swine flu, this is not an Internet rumor! @molzy and I are betrothed!}}</ref>
