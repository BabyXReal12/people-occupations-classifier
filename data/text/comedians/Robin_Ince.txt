Starting at York House prep school at Redheath in Hertfordshire, from the age of thirteen, Ince was educated at Cheltenham College,
a boarding independent school for boys in the spa town of Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, followed by Royal Holloway, University of London, from which he graduated in English and Drama in 1991.
==Stand-up career==
In 1990, Ince first appeared at Greyfriars Kirkhouse at the Edinburgh Festival where Eddie Izzard was running a venue. At the time Ince was performing in a play called Shadow Walker by Trevor Maynard.
He had appeared at the Cafe Royale as part of the Edinburgh Fringe show Rubbernecker, alongside Stephen Merchant, Jimmy Carr and Ricky Gervais in 2001.

As a close friend of Ricky Gervais, Ince opened as a support act for his Politics tour in 2004 and his Fame (comedy) Fame tour in 2007. He also appears on the DVD and often appears in Rickys video podcasts, mainly being bullied, annoyed and attacked by Gervais.

Throughout 2008, Ince had residency at the Dorchester Arts Centre trying out new material for his upcoming shows. In late 2008 he released a live stand up DVD entitled Robin Ince is as Dumb as You, released by Go Faster Stripe.
Then between January and April 2009, Ince performed his UK tour Bleeding Heart Liberal, playing 51 dates. Towards the end of 2009 and into 2010, Ince toured his next show entitled Robin Ince vs. the Moral Majority. In 2011 he started on the road again performing his Happiness Through Science UK show which continued to add many additional dates and whose scheduled was extended into 2012.

in April 2015, Ince announced that he would soon give up stand-up. The main reason he gave was to spend more time with his son; also, he cited well founded self-doubt.
However, he started a stand-up tour, Pragmatic Insanity, in September 2017.

In September 2016, Ince performed at the Keep Corbyn rally in Brighton in support of Jeremy Corbyns Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2016 campaign in the Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2016 Labour Party leadership election.

In 2005, Ince began running the Book Club night at The Albany, London, where acts are encouraged to perform turns of new and experimental material. The club gets its name from Inces attempts to read aloud from – and humorously criticise – various second-hand books which the audience and he have brought in for the occasion. The Book Club proved to be so successful that Ince took it on a full UK tour in 2006, the same year he won the Time Out (company) Time Out Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy.
In 2010, Ince published a book entitled Robin Inces Bad Book Club about his favourite books that he has used for his shows.
