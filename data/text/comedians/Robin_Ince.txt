==Stand-up career==
In 1990, Ince first appeared at Greyfriars Kirkhouse at the Edinburgh Festival where Eddie Izzard was running a venue. At the time Ince was performing in a play called Shadow Walker by Trevor Maynard.<ref>Robin Ince in "Shadow Walker", reviewed in "The Stage" 23 August 1990</ref> He had appeared at the Cafe Royale as part of the Edinburgh Fringe show Rubbernecker, alongside Stephen Merchant, Jimmy Carr and Ricky Gervais in 2001.

As a close friend of Ricky Gervais, Ince opened as a support act for his Politics tour in 2004 and his Fame (comedy) Fame tour in 2007. He also appears on the DVD and often appears in Rickys video podcasts, mainly being bullied, annoyed and attacked by Gervais.

Throughout 2008, Ince had residency at the Dorchester Arts Centre trying out new material for his upcoming shows. In late 2008 he released a live stand up DVD entitled Robin Ince is as Dumb as You, released by Go Faster Stripe.<ref>{{cite web  title=Robin Ince is as Dumb as You  url=http://www.gofasterstripe.com/cgi-bin/website.cgi?page=videofull&id=5042}}</ref> Then between January and April 2009, Ince performed his UK tour Bleeding Heart Liberal, playing 51 dates.

in April 2015, Ince announced that he would soon give up stand-up. The main reason he gave was to spend more time with his son; also, he cited well founded self-doubt.<ref>{{cite web  last1=Ince  first1=Robin  title=Losing My Religion – on why I am giving up stand up  url=https://robinince.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/losing-my-religion-on-why-i-am-giving-up-stand-up/  publisher=Robin Inces blog  accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref> However, he started a stand-up tour, Pragmatic Insanity, in September 2017.
