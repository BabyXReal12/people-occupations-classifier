William Alexander "Bud" Abbott (October 2, 1897 – April 24, 1974) was an American actor of burlesque, radio, stage, television and film, producer, and comedian. He is best remembered as the Double act "straight man" of the comedy duo Abbott and Costello, along with Lou Costello.<ref name=nytobit/> Abbott was active for over 30 years, appearing in both television and film roles.

==Early life==
Abbott was born in Asbury Park, New Jersey on October 2, 1897, into a show business family.<ref name=nytobit/><ref name=dob>The year of birth has been reported as 1895, 1896, 1897, and 1898 in different sources. The 1895 date was perpetuated by sources copying from earlier sources. His birth certificate and World War I draft card both use "October 2, 1897".</ref> His parents, Rae Fisher and Harry Abbott, had worked for the Barnum and Bailey Circus.<ref name="http://www.biography.com/people/bud-abbott-20617237">{{cite web url=http://www.biography.com/people/bud-abbott-20617237 title=Bud Abbott  publisher=biography.com accessdate=November 15, 2014}}</ref><ref name="google">{{cite book title=The funsters author1=Parish, J.R. author2=Leonard, W.T. date=1979 publisher=Arlington House isbn=9780870004186 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zn1ZAAAAMAAJ accessdate=November 15, 2014}}</ref> Several years after the family relocated to Brooklyn, Abbott dropped out of grammar school and began working summers with his father at Dreamland Park on Coney Island. When he was 15, Abbott signed on as a cabin boy on a Norwegian steamer but was soon forced to shovel coal. He eventually worked his way back to the United States after a year.

His father was a longtime advance man for the Columbia Burlesque Wheel, and he installed Bud in the box office of the Casino Theatre (New York, New York) Casino Theater in Brooklyn. Bud spent the next few years in burlesque box offices. In 1918, working in Washington, D.C., he met and married Jenny Mae Pratt, a burlesque dancer, and comedian who performed as Betty Smith. They remained together until his death 55 years later. In 1923 Abbott produced a cut-rate vaudeville tab show called Broadway Flashes, which toured on the Gus Sun circuit.<ref>Slide, Anthony.

Westport, Connecticut, Greenwood Press, 1994, p. 1.</ref> Abbott began performing as a Straight man (stock character) straight man in the show when he could no longer afford to pay one. He continued producing and performing in burlesque shows on the Mutual Burlesque wheel, and as his reputation grew, he began working with veteran comedians like Harry Steppe and Harry Evanson.<ref name="Furmanek 1991">Furmanek, Bob and Ron Palumbo (1991).

==Career==
===Lou Costello and Hollywood===
Abbott crossed paths with Lou Costello in burlesque a few times in the early 1930s when Abbott was producing and performing in Minskys Burlesque shows and Costello was a rising comic. They first worked together in stock burlesque in 1935 at the Eltinge Theatre on 42nd Street, after an illness sidelined Costellos regular partner.<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia last=  first=  authorlink=  editor-first=  editor-last=  editor-link=  encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica title=Abbott, Bud; and Costello, Lou  edition=15th  year=2010  publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes location= Chicago, Illinois isbn=978-1-59339-837-8 pages=13}}</ref> They formally teamed up in 1936, and went on to perform together in burlesque, vaudeville, minstrel shows, and stage shows.<ref name=nytobit/>

In 1938, they received national exposure as regulars on the Kate Smith Hour radio show, which led to roles in a Broadway musical, The Streets of Paris. In 1940, Universal Studios Universal signed the team for their first film, One Night in the Tropics. Despite having minor roles, Abbott and Costello stole the film with several classic routines, including an abbreviated version of "Whos On First?"<ref name="Furmanek 1991"/>

During World War II, Abbott and Costello were among the most popular and highest-paid stars in the world. Between 1940 and 1956 they made 36 films and earned a percentage of the profits on each.<ref name="Furmanek 1991"/> They had their own radio program (The Abbott and Costello Show (radio program) The Abbott and Costello Show) throughout the 1940s, first on NBC from 1942 to 1947, and from 1947 to 1949 on American Broadcasting Company ABC. In the 1950s, they introduced their comedy to live television on The Colgate Comedy Hour, and launched their own half-hour series, The Abbott and Costello Show.

Abbott was very supportive of his relatives. Norman and Betty Abbott, the children of Buds older sister, Olive, started their careers working behind the scenes on Abbott and Costello films. Betty became Blake Edwards longtime script supervisor, and Norman directed many television sitcoms, including the Jack Benny Show and Sanford and Son.{{citation needed date=December 2016}}

===Strain and split===
Relations between Abbott and Costello were strained by egos and salary disputes. In their burlesque days they split their earnings 60%–40%, favoring Abbott, because the wiktionary:straight man straight man was always viewed as the more valuable member of the team. This was eventually changed to 50%–50%, but after a year in Hollywood, Costello insisted on a 60%–40% split in his favor, and it remained so for the remainder of their careers. Costello also demanded that the team be renamed "Costello and Abbott," but this was rejected by Universal Studios, resulting in a "permanent chill" between the two partners, according to Lous daughter Chris Costello in her biography Lous on First. Their relationship was further strained by Abbotts alcohol abuse, a habit motivated by his desire to stave off epileptic seizures.

The teams popularity waned in the 1950s, and they were bedeviled by tax issues; the Internal Revenue Service IRS demanded heavy back taxes, forcing the partners (both of whom had been free spenders and serious gamblers) to sell most of their assets, including the rights to many of their films. Universal dropped their contract after 14 years in 1955. Abbott and Costello split in 1957.<ref>{{cite news  agency= United Press International  title=Abbott, Costello Split.

===Later years===
In 1960, Abbott began performing with a new partner, Candy Candido, to good reviews. But Abbott called it quits, remarking that "No one could ever live up to Lou." The following year, Abbott performed in a dramatic television episode of General Electric Theater titled "The Jokes on Me". A few years later, Abbott provided his own voice for the Hanna-Barbera animated series The Abbott and Costello Cartoon Show, with Stan Irwin providing the voice of Lou Costello.
