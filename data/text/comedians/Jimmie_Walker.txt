==Early life==
Walker was born in The Bronx, New York. Walker attended Theodore Roosevelt High School (New York City) Theodore Roosevelt High School in New York City. Through a federal program known as SEEK, or "Search for Education, Evaluation, and Knowledge," he continued his studies and entered into the field of radio engineering with WRVR. As a young man, Walker was a vendor at Yankee Stadium, starting with the 1964 World Series. He was given a United States dollar coin silver dollar by Mickey Mantle, which he still has.

==Career==
In 1967, Walker began working full-time with WLTW WRVR, the radio station of the Riverside Church. In 1969, Walker began performing as a stand-up comedian and was eventually discovered by the casting director for Good Times, after making appearances on Rowan & Martins Laugh In and on the Jack Paar Jack Paar Show. He eventually released one stand-up comedy album during the height of his Good Times popularity: Dyn-o-mite on Buddah Records (5635). During Good Times<nowiki></nowiki> 1974–75 United States network television schedule 1974–75 season, Walker was 26 years old, though his character was much younger. John Amos, the actor who portrayed Walkers father on Good Times, was actually just eight years older than Walker. Walker credits producer/director John Rich (director) John Rich for inventing "Dy-no-mite!" which Rich insisted Walker say on every episode. Both Walker and executive producer Norman Lear were skeptical of the idea, but the phrase and Walkers character caught on with the audience.<ref name=CNN /> Also, off- and on-camera, Walker did not get along with series lead, Esther Rolle, who played Florida Evans, in the series, because she and Amos disapproved of Walkers increasingly buffoonish character and his popularity, and Walker felt hurt by their disdain. Dissatisfaction led Amos (before Rolle), to leave the show, making Walker the star of the show.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/archive/index.php/t-53025.html title=Was Jimmie Walker getting along with Esther Rolle and John Amos on the set?
