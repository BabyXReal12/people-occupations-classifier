Jack Handey (born February 25, 1949) is an American humorist. He is best known for his "Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey", a large body of Surrealism surrealistic one-liner jokes, as well as his "Fuzzy Memories" and "My Big Thick Novel" shorts, and for his deadpan delivery.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/jack-handey-deploys-drone-strikes-in-the-war-against-cliches/article13682794/ title=Jack Handey deploys drone strikes in the war against clichés last=Mclaren first=Leah work=The Globe and Mail date=9 August 2013 accessdate=3 November 2015}}</ref> Although many people assume otherwise,<ref name=Sacks2009/><ref name=TM2002/> Handey is a real person, not a pen name or  character.

==Career==
Handeys earliest writing job was for a newspaper, the San Antonio Express-News. He lost the job, in his words, after writing an article that "offended local car dealerships".<ref name=TM2002/> His first comic writing was with comedian Steve Martin. According to Martin, Handey got a job writing for Saturday Night Live after Martin introduced Handey to the shows creator, Lorne Michaels.<ref name=Coyle/> For several years Handey worked on other television projects: the Canadian sketch series Bizarre (TV series) Bizarre in 1980; the 1980 Steve Martin television special Comedy Is Not Pretty!; and Lorne Michaels short-lived sketch show on NBC called The New Show in 1984. Handey returned to Saturday Night Live in 1985 as a writer.<ref name=Sacks2009/>

===Deep Thoughts===
In April 1984, National Lampoon (magazine) National Lampoon published the first of Jack Handeys Deep Thoughts. Additional Deep Thoughts appeared in the October and November 1984 editions as well as in the short-lived comedy magazine Army Man (magazine) Army Man, while more appeared in 1988 in The Santa Fe New Mexican. The one-liners were to become Handeys signature work, notable for their concise humor and their outlandish hypothetical situations. For example:

*If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.<ref name="Berkley"/>
*"The crows seem to be calling my name", thought Caw.<ref name=Handey1993/>

Handeys work next showed up in the Michael Nesmith-produced TV series Television Parts in the format which would later become famous on Saturday Night Live (though in Television Parts, Nesmith provided the narration). Some of these segments appeared in the compilation video of that program, Doctor Ducks Super Secret All-Purpose Sauce.

Between 1989 and 1990, Deep Thoughts were shown during commercial breaks on The Comedy Channel (United States) The Comedy Channel with Handeys narration.
 
Between 1991 and 1998, Saturday Night Live included Deep Thoughts on the show as an interstitial segment (between sketches). Introduced by Phil Hartman and read live by Handey (neither actually appeared on screen), the one-liners proved to be extremely popular. Hartman would intone "And now, Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey...", and peaceful easy listening music would play while the screen showed soothing pastoral scenes, much like a New Age relaxation video. Handey would then read the Deep Thought as the text to it scrolled across the screen. They became an enduring feature of SNL, which often had multiple Thoughts in each episode, and made Handey a well-known name.

===Other SNL work===
Other Handey creations that appeared on SNL include the Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer,<ref name=Sacks2009/> "Fuzzy Memories" which depicted reenactments of a twisted childhood memory and aired in the late 1990s, and the short-lived "My Big Thick Novel", which were spoken excerpts from a very long book in the style of "Deep Thoughts" and which aired during the 2001–03 seasons of SNL.

Handey is also credited with creating Toonces the Driving Cat, the cat who could drive a car, although not very well.<ref name="toonces">Carman, John (February 14, 1992). "We Paws for This Message", San Francisco Chronicle.</ref> The recurring skit originated in 1989 with Steve Martin and Victoria Jackson as the crash-prone kittens owners. In 1992 NBC aired a half-hour Toonces special. Handey, who owned a real cat by the same name, once said he could not remember exactly how he dreamed up the premise. He said, "It was just one of those free association ideas you write down and look at later and think, Maybe.{{ "}}<ref name="toonces"/>

===Further writing===
In early April 2008, Handey published his first collection of magazine humor pieces, "What Id Say to the Martians and Other Veiled Threats". Associated Press critic Jake Coyle wrote, "With absurdist musings such as these, Handey has established himself as the strangest of birds: a famous comedian whose platform is not the stage or screen, but the page."<ref name=Coyle/> Handey subsequently became a regular contributor to The New Yorker Shouts and Murmurs section.<ref name=TheNewYorker/>

On July 16, 2013 Handeys first novel, The Stench of Honolulu, was released.<ref name=Kirkus/>
