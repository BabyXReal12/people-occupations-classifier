==Books==
Comedy books by Smith include How To Be Cool
(Harry Enfield said of it Will Smith is the coolest guy in the world (if uncool is the new cool) – hes also terrifically funny), and The Joy of No Sex, published by Penguin Group Penguin,
a parody of The Joy of Sex.

Smith writes for various publications, including the magazine Intelligent Life (magazine) Intelligent Life, in which he learns something new for each issue. Articles have included banjo-playing, ice-sculpting, circus skills and making a soufflé.
In 2015 Smith published his first novel, Mainlander (4th Estate, a division of HarperCollins),
a thriller about a schoolboy who goes missing on Jersey. The Independent described it as John le Carré meets Middlemarch,
and ShortList called it a knockout.
The Daily Mail also gave it a positive review, hailing it as a proper work of fiction... A carefully worked plot, seen through the viewpoints of a clutch of cast members, builds nicely to a satisfying climax.
Smith reflects on the difference between writing for television and writing a novel in The Guardian. "The chain from author to reader is short and simple – agent, editor, proofreader, shop/website. In TV, the script will have to be signed off by producers, executive producers, genre commissioners and channel commissioners, and that’s still only a starting point". He cites as his influences John Cleese and Stephen Fry, as well as Charlotte Bronte and George Eliot.
