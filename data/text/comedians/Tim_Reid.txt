Years later, Reid and Dreesen wrote a book about those years called Tim & Tom: An American Comedy in Black and White (2008, {{ISBN 978-0-226-70900-0}}), co-written with sports writer Ron Rapoport).<ref>[http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo5631126.html Tim and Tom] page at The University Press of Chicago.</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005347/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm "Tim Reid Biography"] at IMDb.</ref>

Reid appeared in the It (miniseries) initial movie version of Stephen Kings epic horror novel It (novel) It. He played the role of Mike Hanlon, librarian at the Derry, Maine Public Library and one of the seven main protagonists. Though he admitted having a great time working on the project, Reid later expressed his disappointment with the fact that his character was absent from the climatic showdown against the titular villain (played by Tim Curry). He made an appearance as Sgt. Ray Bennett of the Seacouver Police Department in three first-season episodes of Highlander: The Series. He had a starring role in the series Sister, Sister (TV series) Sister Sister as Ray Campbell, for the entire six-season run.

==Directing==

==New Millennium Studios ==
Tim and Daphne Maxwell Reid built New Millennium Studios in 1997.  Located in Petersburg, Virginia the 57.4-acre site with its 14,850-square-foot sound studio was both the only Black owned film studio in the United States since the 1930s, but also one of the largest independent film studios outside of Hollywood.

New Millennium Studios was used in dozens of movie and television productions, including scenes from the 2001 film "Hearts in Atlantis," of the Stephen King novel; parts of 2000s "The Contender," and elements of Steven Spielbergs 2012 film, "Lincoln," were all shot there. The Reids also produced feature films of their own.

Due to "a lack of incentives in the state" to bring film production to Virginia, the Reids sold the property in March 2015 for $1.475 million to Four Square Property Management LLC, a company formed by Four Square Industrial Constructors, based in Chester, Virginia.

==Personal life==
In 1966, Reid married Rita Ann Sykes; they divorced on May 9, 1980. They have two children together: Timothy II (born 1968) and Tori Reid (born 1971). On December 4, 1982, he married actress Daphne Maxwell Reid. Reid was named to the board of directors of the American Civil War Center in July 2011 at Tredegar Iron Works.<ref>[http://thisweekinthecivilwar.com/?p=606 "Actor, studio founder Tim Reid named to board of Virginia Civil War center"], This Week in the Civil War, This Week in the Civil War.</ref> On May 10, 2014, Reid received a VCU honorary doctorate for his many outstanding and distinguished contributions. He delivered a commencement speech during the ceremony.  During the 1980s and 1990s Reid served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute.<ref>{{cite book author1=Editor title=National Student Film Institute/L.A:  The Sixteenth Annual Los Angeles Student Film Festival date=June 10, 1994 location=The Directors Guild Theatre pages=10–11 accessdate=6 January 2018 ref=Program}}</ref><ref>{{cite book author1=Editor title=Los Angeles Student Film Institute: 13th Annual Student Film Festival date=June 7, 1991 location=The Directors Guild Theatre page=3 accessdate=6 January 2018 ref=Program}}</ref>
