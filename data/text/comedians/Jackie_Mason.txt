==Career==

===Early years===
Mason has written most of his own material.<ref name=autogenerated8 /> A sampling of his humor is his commentary on doctors: "Thats a great profession, a doctor. Where else can you ask a woman to get undressed and then send the bill to her husband?"<ref name=autogenerated9 /> And his commentary on what is important in life: "Money is not important.

He was a comedian at the Fieldston Hotel in Swan River (New York) Swan Lake, New York, in the summer of 1955.<ref>Keith Loria (October 20, 2016).[http://www.fairfaxtimes.com/articles/howard-theatre-welcomes-legendary-comedian/article_57bb44b8-96f8-11e6-841a-2ffd9eb55b61.html "Howard Theatre welcomes legendary comedian"<!-- Bot generated title -->], Fairfax Times</ref> Mason was let go because his act was considered too far ahead of its time. The patrons had not been exposed to a comic who seemed to be ridiculing them. A few years later, Don Rickles came along, but at that point audiences had become open to this type of humor throughout the Borscht Belt. He adopted his stage name after appearing on the Barry Gray (radio) Barry Gray radio show.<ref name="billboard1">[http://www.billboard.com/artist/303996/jackie-mason/biography Jackie Mason - Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->], Billboard</ref> He performed at New York City nightclubs (where he was earning as much as $10,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation US 10000 1964 r=-3}}}} in current dollar terms) a week), and on The Steve Allen Show, his first national TV appearance; in 1962, and the Tonight Show with Steve Allen, as well as on The Perry Como Show, The Dean Martin Show, and The Gary Moore Show.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=autogenerated8 /> The William Morris Agency advised him in 1962 to take elocution lessons so that he could shed his heavy Jewish accent, but he refused.<ref name="billboard1"/><ref name=autogenerated9 /><ref name=autogenerated10 />

==="Middle finger" incident (1964) ===
On October 18, 1964, in an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, Mason allegedly gave host Ed Sullivan the Finger (gesture) finger on air. Footage of the incident shows Mason in the middle of doing his stand-up comedy act and then looking toward Sullivan, who had placed himself directly behind the camera, commenting that Sullivan was signaling him.<ref name=autogenerated8 /><ref name=autogenerated9 /> Sullivan was reportedly letting Mason know (by holding up two fingers) that he had only two minutes left, and to cut his act short, as the program was about to cut away due to having been partly pre-empted by an impromptu speech by President of the United States President Lyndon B. Johnson that the show carried.<ref name=autogenerated8 /><ref name="people1"/>

Masonâclearly distractedâbegan working his own fingers into his act to make fun of the situation, and pointed toward Sullivan with an index finger, a thumb, but not (as Sullivan mistakenly believed) his middle finger.<ref name=autogenerated8 /> Sullivan was clearly infuriated by this, and banned Mason from future appearances on the show, canceling Masons $45,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation US 45000 1964 r=-3}}}} in current dollar terms), six-appearance contract.<ref name=autogenerated8 /><ref name=autogenerated9 /> Mason denied knowingly giving Sullivan the middle finger; he later said that he had not heard of the middle finger gesture at that time.<ref name="people1"/> To clear his name, Mason filed a libel suit on the grounds that Sullivan had defamed him at the New York Supreme Court.  That court dismissed most of Masons complaint.  Both Mason and Sullivan appealed to the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division New York Supreme Court Appellate Division (which reinstated three additional causes of action against Sullivan) in June 1966.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref>{{IMDb name id=0838047 name=Ed Sullivan section=bio}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated15>Barry Avrich (2016).

Sullivan asserted that Mason was unpredictable and could not be trusted. Because of Sullivans influence, he was branded as unreliable, volatile, and obscene, and he failed to get substantial TV work for the next two decades.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=autogenerated8 /><ref name="people1"/><ref name=autogenerated7 />  There was no ruling on the merits, merely a determination that Masons suit could proceed and that he would be given an opportunity to prove his claim.

Mason was given a single comeback appearance on Sullivans TV program two years later, and Sullivan publicly apologized to him, but the damage was done.<ref name=autogenerated8 /> At that time, Mason opened his monologue by saying, "It is a great thrill ... and a fantastic opportunity to see me in person again."<ref name=autogenerated15 /> Mason later appeared on the show five times: April 23, 1967; February 25, 1968; November 24, 1968; July 22, 1969; and August 31, 1969.<ref>http://ctva.biz/US/MusicVariety/EdSullivan_17_(1964-65).htm</ref> Mason later said: "It took 20 years to overcome what happened in one minute".<ref name=autogenerated8 />

In January 2001, Mason co-founded the organization One Jerusalem in response to the Oslo Accords Oslo peace agreement. Its stated cause is "Maintaining a united Jerusalem as the un-divided capital of Israel."<ref name="one-jerusalem">[http://www.onejerusalem.org/about.php "About Us."] One Jerusalem.</ref>

Mason, in 2003, counseled Israeli leaders to consider the total expulsion of Palestinians from Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip.<ref name="eviction">Mason, Jackie and Raoul Felder. "Time to Threaten Arabs with Mass Eviction." The Jewish Press. January 29, 2003.</ref> Mason and Raoul Felder wrote, "We have paralyzed ourselves by our sickening fear of World Opinion, which is why we find it impossible to face one simple fact: We will never win this war unless we immediately threaten to drive every Arab out of Israel if the killing doesnt stop."<ref name="eviction"/> They added: "We are brain-dead if we accept the idea that we have to guess which Arab is our next killer. We are not obligated to victimize ourselves by letting the Arabs play Russian roulette with Jewish lives. Israelis are constantly asked the same obnoxious question: How can you throw the Arabs out? where would they go? The answer is, if they dont care whom they kill, why are we obligated to care where they go?"<ref name="eviction"/>

==Controversy==
In 1991, Mason was criticized by African-American organizations such as the NAACP when he called New York City mayor David Dinkins "a fancy Wiktionary:schvartze schvartze with a moustache".<ref>{{Cite news url = http://metro.co.uk/2006/06/13/metrolife-jackie-mason-166508/ title = Metrolife: Jackie Mason last = Chadwick first = Alan date = June 13, 2006 newspaper= Metro (British newspaper) Metro access-date = January 2, 2015}}</ref> (Schvartze is usually an offensive Jewish term for a black person). He later apologized.<ref name=autogenerated8 /> In 2009, Mason also referred to Barack Obama as a schvartze during one of his stand-up routines, which prompted members of the audience to walk out.<ref>Bill Hutchiinson.

On August 28, 2006, Mason filed a lawsuit against the group Jews for Jesus for using his likeness in a pamphlet.<ref name="2006-lawsuit">[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14512457/ "Oy!

{{quote While I have the utmost respect for people who practice the Christian faith, the fact is, as everyone knows, I am as Jewish as a Matzah ball or kosher salami.}}

Mason asserted that the group was using his image and fame to gain attention and converts. The group responded to the suit by saying, "Shame on him for getting so upset about this."<ref name="2006-lawsuit"/> The lawsuit was settled in 2006, with Jews for Jesus apologizing.<ref name="2006-lawsuit-apology">{{cite news  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/nyregion/05mason.html  title=To Settle Suit, Jews for Jesus Apologizes to Jackie Mason  date=June 12, 2008  accessdate=October 4, 2008  author=Anemona Hartcollis  publisher=The New York Times}}</ref>
