Known for his delivery and voice, as well as his use of innuendo and pun, Masons often culturally grounded humor has been described as irreverent and sometimes politically incorrect.
A critic for Time wrote that he spoke to audiences: "with the Yiddish locutions of an immigrant who just completed a course in English.  By mail."
