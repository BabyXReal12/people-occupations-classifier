Andy Samuel Griffith (June 1, 1926  – July 3, 2012) was an American actor, comedian, television producer, Southern Gospel Southern gospel singer, and writer,
whose career spanned seven decades of music and television.

Known for his southern drawl, his characters with a folksy-friendly personality, and his gruff, gregarious voice, Griffith was a Tony Award nominee for two roles, and gained prominence in the starring role in film director director Elia Kazans film A Face in the Crowd (film) A Face in the Crowd (1957) before he became better known for his television roles, playing the lead roles of Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show) Andy Taylor in the sitcom The Andy Griffith Show (1960–1968) and Ben Matlock in the legal drama Matlock (TV series) Matlock (1986–1995).

==Early life and education==
Griffith was born on June 1, 1926 in Mount Airy, North Carolina, the only child of Carl Lee Griffith and his wife, Geneva (Nunn).
As a baby, Griffith lived with relatives until his parents could afford to buy a home. With neither a crib nor a bed, he slept in dresser drawers for several months. In 1929, when Griffith was three, his father began working as a helper or carpenter and purchased a home in Mount Airys "Blue-collar worker blue-collar" south side.

Griffith grew up listening to music. By the time he entered school, he was well aware that he was from what many considered the "wrong side of the tracks". He was a shy student, but once he found a way to make his peers laugh, he began to come out of his shell and come into his own.

As a student at Mount Airy High School, Griffith cultivated an interest in the arts, and he participated in the schools drama program. A growing love of music, particularly swing music swing, would change his life. Griffith was raised Baptist
and looked up to Ed Mickey, a minister at Grace Moravian Church, who led the brass band and taught him to sing and play the trombone. Mickey nurtured Griffiths talent throughout high school until graduation in 1944. Griffith was delighted when he was offered a role in Lost Colony (play) The Lost Colony by Paul Green (playwright) Paul Green, a play about Roanoke Island still performed today. He performed as a cast member of the play for several years, playing a variety of roles, until he finally landed the role of Walter Raleigh Sir Walter Raleigh, the namesake of North Carolinas capital.

He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill University of North Carolina (UNC) in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and graduated with a Bachelor of Music academic degree degree in 1949. He began college studying to be a Moravian preacher, but he changed his major to music and became a part of the schools PlayMakers Repertory Company#History of the Carolina Playmakers Carolina Playmakers. At UNC, he was president of the UNC chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, Americas oldest Fraternities and sororities fraternity for men in music.
He also played roles in several student operettas, including The Chimes of Normandy (1946), and Gilbert and Sullivans The Gondoliers (1945), The Mikado (1948) and H.M.S. Pinafore (1949).
After graduation, he taught music and drama for a few years at Goldsboro High School in Goldsboro, North Carolina,
where he taught, among others, Carl Kasell.
He also began to write.

==Career==

===From rising comedian to film star===
Griffiths early career was as a monologue monologist, delivering long stories such as What It Was, Was Football, which is told from the point of view of a naïve country preacher trying to figure out what was going on in a American football football game.
The monologue was released as a single in 1953 on the Colonial Records label, and was a hit for Griffith, reaching number nine on the charts in 1954.
Griffith starred in Ira Levins one-hour teleplay version of No Time for Sergeants (March 1955) — a story about a country boy in the United States Air Force — on The United States Steel Hour, a television anthology series. He expanded that role in Ira Levins full-length theatrical version of No Time for Sergeants#Broadway play the same name (October 1955) on Broadway theatre Broadway in New York City.
The role earned him a "Distinguished Supporting or Featured Dramatic Actor" nomination at the 10th Tony Awards 1956 Tony Awards, losing to Ed Begley. He did win the 1956 Theatre World Award, however, a prize given for debut roles on Broadway. "Mr. Griffith does not have to condescend to Will Stockdale" (his role in the play), wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times. "All he has to do is walk on the stage and look the audience straight in the face. If the armed forces cannot cope with Will Stockdale, neither can the audience resist Andy Griffith."
Griffith later reprised his role for the film version (1958) of No Time for Sergeants (1958 film) No Time for Sergeants; the film also featured Don Knotts, as a corporal in charge of fine motor skill manual-dexterity tests, marking the beginning of a lifelong association between Griffith and Knotts. No Time for Sergeants is considered the direct inspiration for the later television situation comedy Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.
His only other New York stage appearance was the titular role in the 1959 musical Destry Rides Again (musical) Destry Rides Again, co-starring Dolores Gray. The show, with a score by Harold Rome, ran for 472 performances and more than a year. Griffith was nominated for "Distinguished Musical Actor" at the 14th Tony Awards 1960 Tony Awards, losing to Jackie Gleason.

He also portrayed a United States Coast Guard US Coast Guard sailor in the feature film Onionhead (1958); it was neither a critical nor a commercial success.

===Dramatic role in A Face in the Crowd (1957)===
File:Andy Griffith-Neal-Remick.jpg thumb Griffith with Lee Remick (l) and Patricia Neal (r) on the set of A Face in the Crowd (1957)
In 1957, Griffith made his film début starring in the film A Face in the Crowd (film) A Face in the Crowd. Although he plays a "country boy," this country boy is manipulative and power-hungry, a vagabond (person) drifter who becomes a Television presenter television host and uses his show as a gateway to political power. The film was directed by Elia Kazan and written by Budd Schulberg and co-stars Patricia Neal, Walter Matthau, Tony Franciosa, and Lee Remick (in her film début as well).

A 2005 DVD reissue of A Face in the Crowd includes a mini-documentary film documentary on the film, with comments from Schulberg and cast members Griffith, Franciosa, and Neal. In his interview, Griffith, revered for his wholesome image for decades, reveals a more complex side of himself. He recalls Kazan prepping him to shoot his first scene with Remicks teenaged baton twirling baton twirler, who captivates Griffiths character on a trip to Arkansas. Griffith also expresses his belief that the film was far more popular and respected in more recent decades than it was when originally released.

===Television roles===

====Early television roles====
Griffiths first appearance on television was in 1955 in the one-hour teleplay of No Time for Sergeants on The United States Steel Hour. That was the first of two appearances on that series.

In 1960, Griffith appeared as a County (United States) county sheriff (who was also a justice of the peace and the copy editing editor of the local newspaper) in an episode of Make Room for Daddy, starring Danny Thomas. This episode, in which Thomass character is stopped for running a stop sign in a little town, served as a backdoor pilot for The Andy Griffith Show. Both shows were produced by Sheldon Leonard.

====The Andy Griffith Show (1960–1968)====

Beginning in September 1960, Griffith starred as Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show) Sheriff Andy Taylor in The Andy Griffith Show for the CBS television network. The show took place in the fictional town of Mayberry, North Carolina, where Taylor, a widower, was the sheriff and town wise old man sage. The show was filmed at Desilu Studios, with exteriors filmed at RKO Forty Acres Forty Acres in Culver City, California.

From 1960 to 1965, the show co-starred character actor and comedian — and Griffiths longtime friend — Don Knotts in the role of Deputy sheriff Deputy Barney Fife, Taylors best friend and comedy partner. He was also Taylors cousin in the show at first, though later they dropped that cousin relationship and talked simply of knowing one another since boyhood. In the series premiere episode, in a conversation between the two, Fife calls Taylor "Cousin Andy", and Taylor calls Fife "Cousin Barney". The show also starred child actor Ron Howard (then known as Ronny Howard), who played Taylors only child, Opie Taylor.

It was an immediate hit. Griffith never received a writing credit for the show, but he worked on the development of every script. Knotts was frequently lauded and won multiple Emmy Awards for his comedic performances (as did Frances Bavier in 1967), while Griffith was never nominated for an Emmy Award during the shows run.

In 1967, Griffith was under contract with CBS to do one more season of the show. However, he decided to quit the show to pursue a movie career and other projects. The series continued as Mayberry R.F.D., with Ken Berry starring as a widower farmer and many of the regular characters recurring, some regularly and some as guest appearances. Griffith served as executive producer (according to Griffith, he came in once a week to review the weeks scripts and give input) and guest starred in five episodes (the pilot episode involved his marriage to Helen Crump).
He made final appearances as Taylor in the 1986 reunion television movie television film, Return to Mayberry, with fellow co-star, Don Knotts. Two reunion specials followed in 1993
and 2003,
with strong ratings.
====Matlock (1986–1995)====
After leaving his still-popular show in 1968, and starting his own production company (Andy Griffith Enterprises) in 1972, Griffith starred in less-successful television series such as The Headmaster (TV series) Headmaster (1970), The New Andy Griffith Show (1971), Adams of Eagle Lake (1975), Salvage 1 (1979) and The Yeagers (1980).

After spending seven months in rehabilitation for leg paralysis from Guillain–Barré syndrome in 1983, Griffith returned to television as the title character, Ben Matlock, in the legal drama Matlock (TV series) Matlock (1986–1995) on NBC and ABC. Matlock was a country lawyer in Atlanta, Georgia, who was known for his Southern American English Southern drawl and for always winning his cases. Matlock also starred unfamiliar, struggling actors (both of whom were childhood fans of Andy Griffith) Nancy Stafford as Michelle Thomas (1987–1992) and Clarence Gilyard, Jr. as Conrad McMasters (1989–1993). By the end of its first season it was a ratings powerhouse on Tuesday nights. Although the show was nominated for four Emmy Awards, Griffith once again was never nominated. He did, however, win a Peoples Choice Award in 1987 for his work as Matlock.
====Other television appearances====
Griffith also made other character appearances through the years on Playhouse 90, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., The Mod Squad, Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series) Hawaii Five-O, The Doris Day Show, Heres Lucy, The Bionic Woman and Fantasy Island, among many others. He also reprised his role as Ben Matlock on Diagnosis: Murder in 1997, and his final guest-starring role was in 2001 in an episode of Dawsons Creek.

===Films (including television films)===
For most of the 1970s, Griffith starred or appeared in many television films, including The Strangers In 7A (1972), Go Ask Alice (1973), Winter Kill (1974) and Pray for the Wildcats (1974), which marked his first villainous role since A Face in the Crowd. Griffith appeared again as a villain in Savages (1974 film) Savages (1974), a television film based on the novel Deathwatch (book) Deathwatch (1972) by Robb White. Griffith received his only Primetime Emmy Award nomination as Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor – Miniseries or a Movie Outstanding Supporting Actor – Miniseries or a Movie for his role as the father of a murder victim in the television film Murder in Texas (1981) and won further acclaim for his role as a homicide homicidal villain in the television film Murder in Coweta County (1983), co-starring music legend Johnny Cash as the sheriff. He also appeared in several miniseries television miniseries, including the television version of From Here to Eternity (TV series) From Here to Eternity (1979), Roots: The Next Generations (1979), Centennial (miniseries) Centennial (1978), and the Watergate scandal-inspired The Company (Ehrlichman novel) Washington: Behind Closed Doors (1977), playing a former president loosely based on Lyndon B. Johnson.

Most of the television movies in which Griffith starred were also attempts to launch a new series. Winter Kill (1974) launched the short-lived Adams of Eagle Lake, which was canceled in 1975 after only two episodes. A year later, he starred as a New York City attorney for the DAs office in Street Killing, which also failed to launch a new show. Two television films for NBC in 1977, The Girl in the Empty Grave and Deadly Game, were attempts for Griffith to launch a new series featuring him as Police Chief Abel Marsh, a more hard-edged version of Andy Taylor; despite strong ratings, both were unsuccessful in leading to a new TV show.

While appearing in television films and guest roles on television series over the next 10 years, Griffith also appeared in two feature films, both of which flopped at the box office. He co-starred with Jeff Bridges as a crusty old 1930s western actor in the comedy Hearts of the West (1975 film) Hearts of the West (1975), and he appeared alongside Tom Berenger as a gay villainous colonel and cattle baron in the Western comedy spoof Rustlers Rhapsody (1985).

He also appeared as an attorney in the NBC miniseries Fatal Vision (miniseries) Fatal Vision (1984), which is considered a precursor to his role in Matlock.

Griffith stunned many unfamiliar with his A Face in the Crowd work in the television film Crime of Innocence (1985), where he portrayed a callous judge who routinely sentenced juveniles to hard prison time. Also noteworthy in Griffiths darker roles was his character in Under the Influence (1986), a TV-movie where Griffith played an alcoholic, abusive patriarch. He further surprised audiences with his role as a dangerous and mysterious grandfather in the television film Gramps (1995) co-starring John Ritter. He also appeared as a comical villain in the spy movie spoof Spy Hard (1996) starring Leslie Nielsen. In the television film A Holiday Romance (1999), Griffith played the role of Jake Peterson. In the film Daddy and Them (2001), Griffith portrayed a patriarch of a dysfunctional southern family.

In the feature film Waitress (2007 film) Waitress (2007), Griffith played a crusty diner owner who takes a shine to Keri Russells character. His last appearance was the leading role in the romantic comedy, independent film Play the Game (2009 film) Play the Game (2009) as a lonely, widowed grandfather re-entering the dating world after a 60-year hiatus. The cast of Play the Game also included Rance Howard, Ron Howards real-life father, who had made appearances in various supporting roles on The Andy Griffith Show, and Clint Howard, Rons younger brother, who had the recurring role of Leon (the kid offering the ice cream cone or peanut butter sandwich) on The Andy Griffith Show.

===Singing and recording career===
Griffith sang as part of some of his acting roles, most notably in A Face in the Crowd and in many episodes of both The Andy Griffith Show and Matlock (TV series) Matlock. In addition to his recordings of comic monologues in the 1950s, he made an album of upbeat country and gospel tunes during the run of The Andy Griffith Show, which included a version of the shows theme sung by Griffith under the title "The Fishin Hole". In recent years, he recorded successful albums of classic Christian hymns for Sparrow Records. His most successful was the release I Love to Tell the Story: 25 Timeless Hymns (1996), which was certified platinum by the RIAA.
The album won Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album at the 1997 Grammy Awards.
Griffith appeared in country singer Brad Paisleys music video "Waitin on a Woman" (2008).
===Name dispute===
William Harold Fenrick of Platteville, Wisconsin, legally changed his name to Andrew Jackson Griffith and ran unsuccessfully for sheriff of Grant County, Wisconsin Grant County in November 2006. Subsequently, actor Griffith filed a lawsuit against Griffith/Fenrick, asserting that he violated Intellectual property trademark, copyright, and Privacy law privacy laws by changing his name for the "sole purpose of taking advantage of Griffiths fame in an attempt to gain votes." On May 4, 2007, United States District Court US District Court Judge John C. Shabaz ruled that Griffith/Fenrick did not violate Law of the United States federal trademark law because he did not use the Griffith name in a commercial transaction but instead in order "to seek elective office, fundamental First Amendment protected speech."
==Association with Don Knotts and Ron Howard==

===Don Knotts===

The video encouraged people to vote and endorsed Democratic Party (United States) Democratic candidates Barack Obama and Joe Biden.
After Griffiths death, Howard stated: "His love of creating, the joy he took in it whether it was drama or comedy or his music, was inspiring to grow up around. The spirit he created on the set of The Andy Griffith Show was joyful and professional all at once. It was an amazing environment. And I think it was a reflection of the way he felt about having the opportunity to create something that people could enjoy. It was always with respect and passion for the opportunity and really what it could offer people in a very unpretentious and earthy way. He felt he was always working in service of an audience he really respected and cared about. He was a great influence on me. His passing is sad. But he lived a great rich life."
Then, 4 years after his TV fathers death, he said in a 2016 interview with US Magazine when Griffith would allow the then 7-year-old boy to embark on his own writing, "I felt elated," Howard recalled: "Andy Griffith said, What are you grinnin at, youngun? I said, That’s the first idea of mine theyve taken. He said, It’s the first that was any damn good. Now let’s rehearse!"
==Political activities==
In 2000, Griffith appeared in a last-minute campaign commercial where he endorsed then-Attorney General Mike Easley for governor of the state of North Carolina. Easley had been locked in a tight race with former Mayor of Charlotte Richard Vinroot and had been losing his lead in the polls. Easley would North Carolina gubernatorial election, 2000 go on to win that November, taking 52% of the vote to Vinroots 46%. Many observers dubbed Easleys victory as the "Mayberry Miracle," and credit Griffiths endorsement for stopping his falling poll numbers.
In October 2008, Griffith appeared with Ron Howard in a Funny or Die video endorsement for Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008 Barack Obamas presidential campaign.
In addition to his online video with Howard in 2008, in politics Griffith favored United States Democratic Party Democrats and recorded television commercials endorsing North Carolina Governors Mike Easley
