Seidell has described how some of the pranks "showed Amirs true colors, his desire to be famous ... [and] cut deeper emotionally", and how he thought Blumenfelds faking a marriage proposal from Seidell to his girlfriend went "too far". After seven videos were posted over two years, there was an 18-month hiatus culminating in Seidell tricking Blumenfeld into thinking he had won United States dollar USD$500,000 after taking a blindfolded half-court basketball shot.<ref name="Wired">{{cite web last=Tanz first=Jason title=Practical Joking Becomes a Battle for the Last Laugh url=https://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/17-09/mf_hoax_collegehumor work=Wired (magazine) Wired date=August 24, 2009 accessdate=September 14, 2013}}</ref> The pranks have led to Seidell and Blumenfeld being interviewed by Wired (magazine) Wired magazine<ref name="Wired" /> and appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.<ref>{{cite web last=Hurwitz first=Jake title=Prank War on Kimmel! url=http://www.collegehumor.com/article/3943621/prank-war-on-kimmel work=CollegeHumor date=March 18, 2009 accessdate=September 14, 2013 authorlink=Jake Hurwitz}}</ref> The pranks were revealed to be fake in July 2017 on the "If I Were You" podcast.
