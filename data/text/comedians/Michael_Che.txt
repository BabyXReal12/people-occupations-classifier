==Career==
Che started doing stand-up comedy in 2009.<ref name= banner>{{cite news  title= Comedian Michael Che talks stand-up, SNL writing gig  last= Greenstein  first= Colette  work= The Bay State Banner  location= Boston, Massachusetts  date= February 20, 2014  page= 15  url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/1504068621/ }}</ref> He would regularly work several sets per night.<ref name= banner/> In 2012, Che appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman.<ref name= banner/><ref name=ew>{{cite web url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/04/28/michael-che-daily-show-snl/  title=Michael Che: 5 things to know  publisher=Entertainment Weekly  date=April 28, 2014  first=Hillary  last=Busis  accessdate=April 28, 2014 }}</ref> In 2013, Variety (magazine) Variety called Che one of "10 Comics to Watch",<ref>{{cite web author=Andrew Barker Senior Features Writer @barkerrant  url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/features/new-york-standup-michael-ches-tastes-run-raw-1200564460/  title=10 Comics to Watch: ‘SNL’ Writer Michael Che Hones Chops in Edinburgh  publisher=Variety  date=July 17, 2013  accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> while Rolling Stone named him one of "The 50 Funniest People."<ref name="rollingstone"/>

Che joined Saturday Night Live as a writer in 2013, at first as a guest writer and soon after as regular writer.<ref name= banner/> On April 28, 2014, it was announced that Che would join The Daily Show in June as a correspondent.<ref name=ew/><ref name=sentinel>{{cite web author=Hal Boedeker  url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/blogs/tv-guy/os-daily-show-names-michael-che-correspondent-20140428,0,6934483.post  title=Daily Show names Michael Che correspondent  publisher=Orlando Sentinel  date=  accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> Che made his onscreen debut as a Daily Show correspondent on June 4, 2014. Although he appeared in only nine segments during his brief time on the show, he was lauded by TV Guide for his work, in particular "Race/Off: Live From Somewhere", in which in response to the 2014 Ferguson protests, he continuously changed the location from where he was reporting his remote segment (with each change in location accompanied by a background change via the green screen), in order to ostensibly find a place where a black man would not be harassed by police officers, ultimately going into outer space. These are regarded by TV Guide as his signature segments on the program.<ref>Rudolph, Ileane (July 27, 2015). "Alumni Association: A roundup of The Daily Show{{}}s coolest Graduates". TV Guide. pp 21-22.</ref>

On September 11, 2014, he was named to take over for Cecily Strong as the Weekend Update anchor for the Saturday Night Live (season 40) 40th season of Saturday Night Live alongside Colin Jost.<ref name="The New York Times"/> Che is the first African-American co-anchor in the history of Weekend Update.<ref>{{cite web url=http://jezebel.com/michael-che-to-become-first-ever-black-anchor-of-snls-w-1633844443 title=Michael Che to Become First Ever Black Anchor of SNLs Weekend Update work=Jezebel accessdate=September 22, 2014}}</ref> During his first two seasons Che primarily hosted Weekend Update, while rarely appearing in any sketches. During his third season, Che was promoted to the main cast and Jay Pharoah left the show. This left Che and Kenan Thompson as the only male African-American cast members until Ches fourth season, when SNL hired Chris Redd, bringing the number of African-American male cast members to three, where it remains today.

In 2014, Che appeared in the movie Top Five, appearing as one of Chris Rocks characters friends.<ref>{{cite news  title= Rock makes another hit with Top Five  last= Sandoval  first= Lapacazo  work= New York Amsterdam News  location= New York, New York  date= December 11, 2014  page= 18  url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/1640492817/ }}</ref>

In December 2017, Che was named co-head writer of Saturday Night Live. <ref>{{cite news  title= Saturday Night Live Makes Its Most Baffling Move Yet  last=Robinson  first=Joanna  work=Vanity Fair  date=December 13, 2017  url= https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/colin-jost-michael-che-head-writers-saturday-night-live accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref>
