To say that he was "on" would be a major understatement.<ref name="reeve"/>}}

Williams and Reeve had a class in dialects taught by Edith Skinner, who Reeve said was one of the worlds leading voice and speech teachers. Skinner had no idea what to make of Williams, added Reeve, as he [Williams] could instantly perform in many dialects, including Scottish, Irish, English, Russian, and Italian. Their primary acting teacher was Michael Kahn (theatre director) Michael Kahn, who was "equally baffled by this human dynamo," notes Reeve. Williams already had a reputation for being funny, but Kahn sometimes criticized his antics as simple stand-up comedy. In a later production, Williams silenced his critics with his convincing role of an old man in The Night of the Iguana, by Tennessee Williams. "He simply was the old man," observed Reeve. "I was astonished by his work and very grateful that fate had thrown us together."<ref name="reeve"/>

==Career==

===Stand-up comedy===

After his family moved to Marin County, Williams began his career doing stand-up comedy shows in the San Francisco Bay Area in the mid-1970s. His first performance took place at the Holy City Zoo, a comedy club in San Francisco, where he worked his way up from tending bar to getting on stage.<ref name=Zehme/> In the 1960s, San Francisco was a center for a rock music renaissance, hippies, drugs, and a sexual revolution, and in the 1970s, Williams helped lead its "comedy renaissance," writes critic Gerald Nachman.<ref name=Nachman>Nachman, Gerald.

He moved to Los Angeles and continued doing stand-up shows at various clubs, including the Comedy Club, in 1977, where TV producer George Schlatter saw him.

The show aired in late 1977 and became his debut TV appearance.<ref name=Maslon/> Williams also performed a show at the LA The Improv Improv that same year for Home Box Office.<ref>video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH7crqRvhhc&list=WL&index=2 "Young Robin Williams at the Los Angeles Improv, 1977]</ref> While the Laugh-In revival failed, it led Williams into a career in television, during which period he continued doing stand-up at comedy clubs, such as the Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood) Roxy, to help him keep his improvisational skills sharp.<ref name=Maslon/><ref>video: {{YouTube id=LsIh5z7oYyY&t=2m25s title=Robin Williams at the Roxy, 1978}}</ref>

Williams was also influenced by Richard Pryors fearless ability to talk about his personal life on stage, with subjects including his use of drugs and alcohol, and Williams added those kinds of topics during his own performances. By bringing up such personal matters as a form of comedy, he told Parkinson, it was "cheaper than therapy" and gave him a way to release his pent-up energy and emotions.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 121}}

====Televised live performances====
Williams won a Grammy Award for the recording of his 1979 live show at the Copacabana in New York, "Reality...What a Concept". Some of his later tours, after he became a TV and film star, include An Evening With Robin Williams (1982–83), Robin Williams: At The Met (1986) and Robin Williams: Live on Broadway (2002). The latter broke many long-held records for a comedy show. In some cases, tickets were sold out within thirty minutes of going on sale.<ref>{{cite web last1=Lee first1=Carter title=Shazbot Robin Williams: Because we did, in fact, love him url=http://www.commdiginews.com/entertainment/media-news-ureviews/shazbot-robin-williams-because-we-did-in-fact-love-him-23602/ website=commdiginews.com accessdate=August 12, 2014 publisher = Communities Digital News date = August 11, 2014 archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140812224009/http://www.commdiginews.com/entertainment/media-news-reviews/shazbot-robin-williams-because-we-did-in-fact-love-him-23602/ archivedate = August 12, 2014 deadurl = no}}</ref> In 1986, Williams released A Night at the Met.<ref>{{cite news last1=Benedictus first1=Leo title=Comedy gold: Robin Williams A Night at the Met url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/dec/06/robin-williams-night-met-comedy-gold accessdate=December 3, 2014 work=The Guardian date=December 6, 2012}}</ref>

After a six-year break, in August 2008, Williams announced a new 26-city tour titled "Weapons of Self-Destruction". He said that this was his last chance to make jokes at the expense of the Bush administration, but by the time the show was staged, only a few minutes covered that subject. The tour started at the end of September 2009 and concluded in New York on December 3, and was the subject of an HBO special on December 8, 2009.{{citation needed date=March 2017}}

====Hardships in performing stand-up====
Williams said that partly due to the stress of performing stand-up, he started using drugs and alcohol early in his career. He further said that he never drank nor took drugs while on stage but occasionally performed when hung over from the previous day. During the period he was using cocaine, he said that it made him paranoid when performing on stage.<ref name=Grobel/>

Williams once described the life of stand-up comedians:
{{quote Its a brutal field, man. They burn out. It takes its toll. Plus, the lifestyle—partying, drinking, drugs. If youre on the road, its even more brutal. You gotta come back down to mellow your ass out, and then performing takes you back up. They flame out because it comes and goes. Suddenly theyre hot, and then somebody else is hot. Sometimes they get very bitter. Sometimes they just give up. Sometimes they have a revival thing and they come back again. Sometimes they snap. The pressure kicks in. You become obsessed and then you lose that focus that you need.<ref name=Nachman/>{{rp 34–35}}}}

Some, such as the critic Vincent Canby, were concerned that his monologues were so intense that it seemed as though at any minute his "creative process could reverse into a complete meltdown."<ref name="When the Laughter Stops">{{cite book   title=Robin Williams: When the Laughter Stops 1951–2014   first=Emily   last=Herbert   publisher=John Blake Publishing Ltd.   location=London   date=November 15, 2014   url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9DpUCgAAQBAJ   isbn=9781784183004   oclc=889523094   accessdate=August 26, 2016}}</ref> His biographer Emily Herbert described his "intense, utterly manic style of stand-up [which sometimes] defies analysis ... [going] beyond energetic, beyond frenetic .. [and sometimes] dangerous ... because of what it said about the creators own mental state."<ref name="When the Laughter Stops"/>

Williams felt secure he would not run out of ideas, as the constant change in world events would keep him supplied.<ref name=Grobel/> He also explained that he often used Free association (psychology)#Characteristics free association of ideas while improvising in order to keep the audience interested.<ref>{{cite av media   via=YouTube   url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LaJDOD5cJI&t=14m20s    date=2002   title=Robin Williams interview with Sir Michael Parkinson, 2002   accessdate=August 26, 2016}}</ref> He noted that the competitive comedy club atmosphere could cause problems. For example, some comedians accused him of intentionally copying their jokes, although Williams strongly denied ever doing so.<ref name=Grobel/> Whoopi Goldberg defended him, explaining that it is difficult for comedians not to pick up and reuse another comedians material, and that it is done "all the time."<ref name="rs comedy">{{cite web   url = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/robin-williams-fears-of-a-clown-20140811   title = Robin Williams: Fears of a Clown   first = Jeff   last = Giles   date = February 21, 1991   accessdate = August 17, 2014   work = Rolling Stone }}</ref> He later avoided going to performances of other comedians to deter similar accusations.<ref name="rs comedy"/>

During a Playboy (magazine) Playboy interview in 1992, Williams was asked whether he ever feared losing his balance between his work and his life. He replied, "Theres that fear—if I felt like I was becoming not just dull but a rock, that I still couldnt speak, fire off or talk about things, if Id start to worry or got too afraid to say something ... If I stop trying, I get afraid." While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist Jerzy Kosiński to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness, Williams felt he could overcome those risks. For that, he credited his father for strengthening his self-confidence, telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him.<ref name=Grobel/>

Starting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Williams began to reach a wider audience with his stand-up comedy, including three HBO comedy specials, Off The Wall (1978), An Evening with Robin Williams (1983) and Robin Williams: Live at the Met (1986).

Letterman, who knew Williams for nearly 40 years, recalls seeing him first perform as a new comedian at The Comedy Store in Hollywood, where Letterman and other comedians had already been doing stand-up. "He came in like a hurricane," said Letterman, who said he then thought to himself, "Holy crap, there goes my chance in show business."<ref>{{Cite web url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/08/19/david_letterman_s_robin_williams_tribute_the_late_show_host_remembers_when.html title = Letterman Remembers the First Time He Met Robin Williams date = August 19, 2014 accessdate = October 23, 2014 website = Slate last = Lockett first = Dee}}</ref>

In an essay published in the journal Neurology two years after his death, Susan Schneider revealed that the pathology of Lewy body disease in Williams was described by several doctors as among the worst pathologies they had seen. She described the early symptoms of his disease as beginning in October 2013. It included a sudden and prolonged spike in fear and anxiety, constipation, urinary difficulty, heartburn, sleeplessness and insomnia, a poor sense of smell, stress, and a slight tremor in his left hand. Eventually, she said, he suffered from paranoia, delusions, severe insomnia, memory loss, and high cortisol levels, indicating stress.

He was considered a "national treasure" by many in the entertainment industry and by the public.<ref name=Grobel/><ref>[https://www.showbiz411.com/2014/08/13/glenn-close-on-friend-and-colleague-robin-williams-was-a-world-treasure "Glenn Close on Friend and Colleague: Robin Williams Was a World Treasure"] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525045202/http://www.showbiz411.com/2014/08/13/glenn-close-on-friend-and-colleague-robin-williams-was-a-world-treasure  date=May 25, 2017 }}, Showbiz411, August 13, 2014</ref>

His on-stage energy and improvisational skill became a model for a new generation of stand-up comedians. Many comedians valued the way he worked highly personal issues into his comedy routines, especially his honesty about drug and alcohol addiction, along with depression.<ref name=CSM>[http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2014/0812/Robin-Williams-His-unscripted-riffs-were-not-merely-funny-but-observant-video "Robin Williams: His unscripted riffs were not merely funny, but observant"],(+video), Christian Science Monitor, August 12, 2014</ref> According to media scholar Derek A.

Williams created a signature free-form persona in comedy, in a style that was so widely and uniquely identified with him, that new comedians imitated Williams personally. Jim Carrey impersonated his Mork character early in his own career.<ref>{{YouTube 9zorOqE0j1c "Jim Carrey Impersonates Robin Williams"}}</ref> This high-spirited persona has been generally credited with paving the way for the growing comedy scene which developed in San Francisco.

His film performances often influenced other actors, both in and out of the film industry.
