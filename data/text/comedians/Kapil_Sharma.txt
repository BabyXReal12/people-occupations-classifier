On 9 September 2016, Sharma tweeted and tagged the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, that he was asked to pay to someone at the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for making his office even though he was paying large amount in taxes. Sharma did not name anybody in this case, nor did he lodge a complaint with BMC. Responding to his tweet the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, asked him to furnish all information to enable them to take strict action.
Thereafter, the BMC started gathering evidence against him related to illegal activities in his Oshiwara office and Goregaon apartment.
