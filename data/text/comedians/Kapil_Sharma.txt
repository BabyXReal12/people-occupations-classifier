Sharma was nominated for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for which he campaigned and regularly promotes on his show.<ref name="timesofindia1"/>

===Twitter controversy===
On 9 September 2016, Sharma tweeted and tagged the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, that he was asked to pay to someone at the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for making his office even though he was paying large amount in taxes. Sharma did not name anybody in this case, nor did he lodge a complaint with BMC. Responding to his tweet the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, asked him to furnish all information to enable them to take strict action.<ref name="auto"/>

Thereafter, the BMC started gathering evidence against him related to illegal activities in his Oshiwara office and Goregaon apartment. The Oshiwara police also registered a case against Sharma and builder Dev Land and Housing Private Ltd (DLH). The FIR was registered by BMC’s P South Ward sub-engineer Abhay Jagtap. However, Sharma had claimed in the HC that the building was constructed as per the sanctioned plan.<ref>{{citeweb url=https://m.mid-day.com/amp/articles/kapil-sharma-to-get-personal-hearing-from-bmc-mumbai-news-illegal-construction/18103174 title=Illegal constructions: Kapil Sharma to get personal hearing from BMC accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>

This got Kapil fuming with anger and he lodged a complaint against the journalist and his previous show, The Kapil Sharma Shows producers, Preeti and Neeti Simoes. He has accused them of extorting Rs 25 lacs from him and in a bid of failing to fulfill the requirement; he has allegedly accused them of tarnishing their image on digital media.<ref>{{Cite web url=https://m.mid-day.com/amp/articles/preeti-simoes-on-kapil-sharmas-complaint-i-think-he-is-suicidal-and-i-am-scared-for-him/19294171 title=Preeti Simoes On Kapil Sharmas Complaint: I Think He Is Suicidal And I Am Scared For Him last= first= date= website=Mid-day archive-url= archive-date= dead-url= access-date=}}</ref>

===Brawl with Sunil Grover===
