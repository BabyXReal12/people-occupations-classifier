==Early life==
Born Clerow Wilson Jr. in Jersey City, New Jersey, he was one of ten children born to Cornelia Bullock and Clerow Wilson Sr.<ref name=tafoya>{{cite book last=Tafoya first=Eddie M.  title=Icons of African American Comedy year=2011 publisher=ABC-CLIO isbn=0-313-38085-6 page=89}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal last=Pierce first=Ponchitta date=April 1968 title=All Flip Over Flip journal=Ebony publisher=Johnson Publishing Company volume=23 issue=6 page=65 issn=0012-9011 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ec4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA72&dq=flip+wilson+jersey+city&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tTxzUcLoKIj8rAGJq4HICw&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=flip%20wilson%20jersey%20city&f=false}}</ref> His father worked as a handyman but, because of the Great Depression, was often out of work. When Wilson was seven years old, his mother abandoned the family. His father was unable to care for the children alone and he placed many of them in foster homes.<ref name=tafoya /> After bouncing from foster homes to reform school, 16-year-old Wilson lied about his age and joined the United States Air Force. His outgoing personality and funny stories made him popular; he was even asked to tour military bases to cheer up other servicemen. Claiming that he was always "flipped out," Wilsons barracks mates gave him the nickname "Flip" which he used as his stage name. Discharged from the Air Force in 1954, Wilson started working as a bellhop in San Franciscos Manor Plaza Hotel.

At the Plazas nightclub, Wilson found extra work playing a drunken patron in between regularly scheduled acts. His inebriated character proved popular and Wilson began performing it in clubs throughout California. At first Wilson would simply ad-lib onstage, but eventually he added written material and his act became more sophisticated.

==Career==
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Wilson toured regularly through nightclubs with a black clientele in the so-called "Chitlin Circuit".<ref name="nytimes" /> During the 1960s, Wilson became a regular at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. An unexpected break came in 1965, when comedian Redd Foxx was a guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson The Tonight Show and host Johnny Carson asked him who the funniest comedian at the time was; Foxx answered, "Flip Wilson".<ref name="nytimes" /> Carson then booked Wilson to appear on The Tonight Show, and Wilson became a favorite guest on that show, as well as on The Ed Sullivan Show. Wilson later singled out Sullivan as providing his biggest career boost. Wilson also made guest appearances on numerous TV comedies and variety shows, such as Heres Lucy (in which he played the role of "Prissy" in a spoof of Gone With the Wind (film) Gone With the Wind, with Lucille Ball as Scarlett),<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0600042/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_15 Heres Lucy, episode "Lucy and Flip Go Legit" (1971)] at IMDb</ref> and The Dean Martin Show, among others.  

Wilsons warm and ebullient personality was infectious.  Richard Pryor told Wilson, "Youre the only performer that Ive ever seen who goes on the stage and the audience hopes that you like them."

A routine titled "Columbus," from the 1967 album Cowboys and Colored People, brought Wilson to Hollywood industry attention.  In this bit, Wilson retells the story of Christopher Columbus from an anachronistic urbanized viewpoint, in which Columbus convinces the Spain Spanish monarchs to fund his voyage by noting that discovering America means that he can also discover Ray Charles. Hearing this, Isabella I of Castile Queen "Isabel Johnson," whose voice is an early version of Wilsons eventual "Geraldine" character, says that "Chris" can have "all the money you want, honey—You go find Ray Charles!"  When Columbus departs from the dock, an inebriated Isabella is there, testifying to one and all that "Chris gonna find Ray Charles!" 

In 1970, Wilson won a Grammy Award for his comedy album The Devil Made Me Buy This Dress. He was also a regular cast member on Rowan & Martins Laugh-In. DePatie-Freleng Enterprises featured Wilson in two TV specials, Clerow Wilson and the Miracle of P.S. 14 and Clerow Wilsons Great Escape.

He greeted all his guests with the "Flip Wilson Handshake,": four hand slaps, two elbow bumps finishing with two hip-bumps. George Carlin was one of the shows writers, and Carlin also made frequent appearances on the show, as the two would expand Carlins news-weather-sports satire. Wilsons characters included Reverend Leroy, materialistic pastor of the "Church of What’s Happening Now," and his most popular character, Geraldine Jones (character) Geraldine Jones, who frequently referred to her unseen boyfriend, "Killer," and whose lines "The devil made me do it" as well as "What you see is what you get" became national catchphrases.
