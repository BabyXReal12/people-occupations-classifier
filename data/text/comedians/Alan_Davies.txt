==Personal life==

Friend and comedy partner Bill Bailey was Daviess best man and delivered a speech at the ceremony.
They have three children.
Davies has narrated an anti-vivisection video called Wasted Lives.
In late 2007 The Times and Daily Telegraph reported that Davies bit the ear of a homeless man.
Davies had just left a wake at the nearby Groucho Club. He told The Times in 2009, "He wasnt a tramp. He was a raging, horrendous arsehole. He called me a cunt several times. Or if it wasnt him, it was his mate. And, yes, I went for him and, yes, I did it in what turned out to be an amusing way." Following the incident, Davies was banned from the Groucho Club.
Davies is a lifelong fan and season ticket holder of Arsenal F.C.. Davies also used to host the podcast "Its Up For Grabs Now"
which took a light-hearted look at goings on at the club. He is also a vegetarian. On 18 January 2011, he began hosting the new Arsenal Podcast "The Tuesday Club" with Ian Stone, Keith Dover,  Tayo Popoola and Skint Records founder Midfield General Damian Harris. His support of Arsenal has been used as a recurring source of humour on QI in various ways, such as by assigning him a buzzer sound of a chant by fans of rival club Manchester United F.C. Manchester United.

He is a supporter of the Labour Party. Davies said: "Social injustice is important to me," "Life isn’t about every man for himself. Life should be about co-operation and collaboration." When being interviewed regarding the broadcast of his Channel 4 sitcom Damned (TV series) Damned which coincided with the 2016 Labour leadership election, Davies openly came out as a supporter of Owen Smiths leadership bid - a bid which ultimately proved unsuccessful as Jeremy Corbyn was returned as Labour leader.

He is currently pursuing a Masters of Arts in Creative Writing at Goldsmiths College, due to complete in September 2018.{{Citation needed date=April 2018}}

==Books==
Daviess first book, the autobiographical My Favourite People and Me, 1978–88 was published by Michael Joseph (Penguin Books) in September 2009.
Of the memoir, Davies said he wished to "attempt to remember what I liked as a boy/youth/idiot and to work out why". The favourite people referred to in the title include Anton Chekhov, John Belushi, Barry Sheene, Margaret Thatcher ("only for a few days" the author allows), John McEnroe and Starsky and Hutch. The book also mentions Arsenal F.C., the football team supported by Davies; he recalls as a child his mother sewing their club badge and captains number onto his shirt, done only a year or so before she died. The paperback was published under the title Rebel Without A Clue: How the 80s Made Me.
