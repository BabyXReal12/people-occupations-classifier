{{Quote I initially planned to stay in the UK for only 12 months to improve my English, but the good weather, the tasty food and the classy women made me stay. In order to blend in with the locals, I decided to get extremely lazy, spend money I dont have and, most importantly, to unjustifiably bang on about my great sense of humour. This is why I decided 1,646 days, nine hours and 42 minutes ago to try my hand at stand-up and become the German Comedy Ambassador.}}

As a result, since October 2003, Wehn has been the self-styled "German Comedy Ambassador in London".<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.elmbridgeguardian.co.uk/leisure/4773281.Henning_heads_to_the_Deutsch_market/  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008061436/http://www.elmbridgeguardian.co.uk/leisure/4773281.Henning_heads_to_the_Deutsch_market/  dead-url=yes  archive-date=8 October 2011  title=Henning heads to the Deutsch market  date=3 December 2009  work=Elmbridge Guardian  accessdate=28 July 2010 }}</ref> After beginning his career as "warm-up act" to various comedians in London (including Stewart Lee for Stewart Lees Comedy Vehicle Comedy Vehicle), he now has his own act on the British comedy circuit.<ref name=":0">{{cite news url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7577301.stm title=Germans flex their funny bone date=23 August 2008 publisher=BBC News accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref>

In May 2015, Wehn presented An Immigrants Guide to Britain on Channel 4, telling Radio Times: "[W]hat I really like about the programme it mixes light-hearted issues (the job market), with more serious ones (trouble of having two water taps instead of just one) to the ultra serious (the British class system)".<ref name="Radio Times 3 May 2015">{{cite news  last= Wehn  first= Henning  title= Henning Wehn on An Immigrants Guide to Britain - and suddenly realising he is one  url= http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-05-03/henning-wehn-on-an-immigrants-guide-to-britain---and-suddenly-realising-he-is-one  date= 3 May 2015 work= Radio Times  location=London  accessdate= 1 March 2016 }}</ref> In October that same year, Wehn was the presenter of the BBC World Service radio documentary Wall in the Head in which he explored "the invisible cultural and psychological divide" between East and West Germans twenty five years after German reunification following the fall of the Berlin Wall.<ref name="Wall in the Head">{{cite episode  title= Wall in the Head   series= The Documentary  credits= Presenter: Henning Wehn, Producer:  Helena Selby  url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0337m36   station= BBC World Service  airdate= 4 October 2015 }}</ref>

==Approach to comedy==
Wehns comedy frequently employs common stereotypes about Germans, with Brian Logan, writing in UK daily newspaper The Guardian in 2015 noting, "Wehn has made a career out of sending up and celebrating German stereotypes. But that particular ingredient is lower in the new shows mix – with abundant TV and radio credits to his name, Wehn is now well enough established to joke not only about who he is, but what he thinks".<ref name="The Guardian 4 March 2015">{{cite news  last= Logan  first= Brian  title= Henning Wehn review – German comedy ambassador’s devilish reception  url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/04/henning-wehn-review-leicester-square-theatre-london-german  date= 4 March 2015 newspaper= The Guardian  location=London  accessdate= 1 March 2016 }}</ref>
