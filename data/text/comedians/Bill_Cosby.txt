==Stand-up career==
Cosby left Temple to pursue a career in comedy. He lined up stand-up comedy stand-up jobs at clubs in Philadelphia and then in New York City, where he appeared at The Gaslight Cafe beginning in 1961.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> He booked dates in cities such as Chicago, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.

While many comics of the time were using the growing freedom of that decade to explore material that was controversial and sometimes risqué, Cosby was making his reputation with humorous recollections of his childhood. Many Americans wondered about the absence of race as a topic in Cosbys stories. As Cosbys success grew he had to defend his choice of material regularly; as he argued, "A white person listens to my act and he laughs and he thinks, Yeah, thats the way I see it too. Okay. Hes white. Im Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? So I figure this way Im doing as much for good race relations as the next guy."<ref>{{Cite book  last = Smith   first = Ronald L.   title = Cosby: The Life of a Comedy Legend  publisher = Prometheus Books   year = 1997   page = 57   isbn = 1-57392-126-2}}</ref>

Seinfeld said of Cosby: "He opened a door for all of us, for all of the networks to even consider that this was a way to create a character, was to take someone who can hold an audience just by being up there and telling their story.

Cosby pursued a variety of additional television projects and appeared as a regular guest host on The Tonight Show and as the star of an annual special for NBC. In 1969, he returned with another series, The Bill Cosby Show, a situation comedy that ran for two seasons. Cosby played a physical education teacher at a Los Angeles high school. While only a modest critical success, the show was a ratings hit, finishing eleventh in its first season. Cosby was lauded for using African-American performers such as Lillian Randolph, Moms Mabley, and Rex Ingram (actor) Rex Ingram as characters. According to commentary on the Season 1 DVDs for the show, Cosby was at odds with NBC over his refusal to include a laugh track in the show, as he felt that viewers had the ability to find humor for themselves when watching a TV show.{{citation needed date=April 2017}}

After The Bill Cosby Show left the air, Cosby resumed his formal education. He began graduate work at the University of Massachusetts Amherst University of Massachusetts, Amherst. For the PBS series The Electric Company (1971 TV series) The Electric Company, Cosby recorded several segments teaching reading skills to young children.{{citation needed date=December 2014}}

When Cosby was about 35 years old in 1972, he received an Master of Arts MA from UMass Amherst and was also back in prime time with a variety series, The New Bill Cosby Show. However, this show lasted only a season. More successful was a Saturday-morning cartoon, Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, hosted by Cosby and based on his own childhood. That series ran from 1972 to 1979, and as The New Fat Albert Show in 1979, and The Adventures of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids. In 1984, Cosby wrote the dissertation: "An Integration of the Visual Media Via Fat Albert And The Cosby Kids into the Elementary School Curriculum as a Teaching Aid and Vehicle to Achieve Increased Learning".

During the 1970s, Cosby and other African-American actors, including Sidney Poitier, joined forces to make some successful comedy films to counter the violent "blaxploitation" films of the era, such as Uptown Saturday Night in 1974; Lets Do It Again (1975 film) Lets Do It Again in 1975; and in 1976, Mother, Jugs & Speed, co-starring Raquel Welch and Harvey Keitel. About this last film, a Rotten Tomatoes reviewer wrote, "Bill Cosby steals the film outright with his hilarious performance as Mother, the streetwise seen-it-all Emergency medical technician EMT."{{citation needed date=April 2018}}

In 1976, Cosby starred in A Piece of the Action (film) A Piece of the Action with Poitier; and California Suite (film) California Suite, a compilation of four Neil Simon plays. He also hosted Cos (TV series) Cos in 1976. In addition, he produced an hour-long variety show featuring puppets, sketches, and musical numbers. It was during this season that ABC decided to take advantage of this phase of Cosbys career, by joining with Filmation producers of Fat Albert to create live-action segments starring Cosby, for the 1964/1971 animated film Journey Back to Oz; it subsequently aired in syndication. Cosby was also a regular on childrens Public broadcasting public television programs starting in the 1970s, hosting the "Picture Pages" segments that lasted into the early 1980s.{{citation needed date=April 2018}}

Plots were often based on ideas that Cosby suggested while in meetings with the writing staff.<ref name="People Magazine article (December 10, 1984)">{{cite web title=People Magazine article (December 10, 1984) url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20089368,00.html website=People accessdate=July 19, 2015}}</ref> The show had parallels to Cosbys actual family life: like the characters Cliff Huxtable Cliff and Clair Huxtable, Cosby and his wife Camille Cosby Camille were college educated and financially successful, and they had five children. On the show, Cosby played the role of an obstetrician. Much of the material from the Television pilot pilot and first season of The Cosby Show was taken from his video Bill Cosby: Himself,{{citation needed date=December 2015}} released in 1983. The series was an immediate success, debuting near the top of the ratings and staying there for most of its eight-season run.{{citation needed date=April 2017}}

In 1987, Cosby attempted to return to film with the spy spoof Leonard Part 6. Although Cosby himself was the producer and wrote the story, he realized during production that the film was not going to be what he wanted and publicly denounced it, warning audiences to stay away.<ref name=yahoobio>{{cite web publisher=Yahoo!

Cosby has been the subject of highly publicized sexual assault allegations. The earliest incidents allegedly took place in the mid-1960s. Numerous women have accused Cosby of rape, drug facilitated sexual assault, sexual battery, child sexual abuse, and sexual misconduct. In October 2014, comedian Hannibal Buress played a comedy routine that alluded to Cosbys covert sexual misbehavior. The routine went viral, which caused assault allegations against Cosby to become more public. Many additional claims were made after that date. The dates of the alleged incidents span from 1965 to 2008 across ten U.S. states and one Canadian province.<ref name="DailyBeastListofAccusersNov2014">{{cite web  url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/24/bill-cosby-s-long-list-of-accusers-so-far-17-alleged-sexual-assault-victims-between-1965-2004.html  title= Bill Cosby’s Long List of Accusers (So Far): 18 Alleged Sexual Assault Victims Between 1965–2004 work=The Daily Beast  first= Marlow  last= Stern accessdate=December 6, 2014}}</ref><ref name=ETOnlineListOfAccusersFeb2015>{{cite web last1=Seemayer first1=Zach title=Bill Cosbys Accusers: A Timeline of Alleged Sexual Assault Claims (Updated) url=http://www.etonline.com/news/154160_timeline_of_bill_cosby_sexual_assault_allegations publisher=ET Online access-date=April 24, 2015 date=February 26, 2015}}</ref><ref name=SlateListofAccusersNov2014>{{cite web first1=Filipa last1=Ioannou first2=Ben last2=Mathis-Lilley first3=Elliot last3=Hannon title=A Complete List of the Women Who Have Accused Bill Cosby of Sexual Assault url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/11/21/bill_cosby_accusers_list_sexual_assault_rape_drugs_feature_in_women_s_stories.html publisher=Slate access-date=April 24, 2015 date=November 21, 2014}}</ref>

Cosby received an award at the celebration of the 50th anniversary commemoration of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling—a ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States U.S. Supreme Court that outlawed racial segregation in public schools. Later, in May 2004, he made public remarks that were critical of African-Americans who put higher priorities on sports, fashion, and "acting hard" than on education, self-respect, and self-improvement. He pleaded for African-American families to educate their children on the many different aspects of Culture of the United States American culture.<ref>{{cite news  last=Brownfeld  first=Alan  date=June 17, 2013  title=Fathers Day with Bill Cosby, an American Original  publisher=Salem-News.com  url=http://www.salem-news.com/articles/june172013/bill-cosby-ab.php  accessdate=June 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  title=Bill Cosby: Charity Work & Causes  publisher=LooktotheStars.org  url=https://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/bill-cosby  accessdate= June 26, 2015}}</ref> In the Pound Cake speech, Cosby asked that African-American parents teach their children better morals at a younger age.

===Autumn Jackson extortion trial===

During Autumn Jacksons extortion trial in July 1997, Cosby testified that he made private payments to Shawn Upshaw, a woman who had briefly been his lover in Las Vegas during the early 1970s. Upshaw later told Cosby that he was the father of her daughter, Autumn Jackson. Cosby denies being the father and said that he gave Upshaw a total of about $100,000 because he did not want her to publicly reveal the affair.<ref>{{cite news  first=John J. last=Goldman  url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/16/news/mn-13121 title=Cosby Testifies About Secret Payments  newspaper=Los Angeles Times publisher=Tronc location=Los Angeles, California date=July 16, 1997 accessdate=August 16, 2018}}</ref> The then-22-year-old Jackson was sentenced to 26 months in jail for trying to extort US$40&nbsp;million from Cosby. In the trial and subsequent appeal, the courts held that Jacksons belief that she was Cosbys child—even if sincere—was irrelevant to the question of her guilt. The courts stated that the mere fact that she was Cosbys child would not have entitled her to the $40 million she demanded, and therefore the demand was extortionate, whether or not she believed herself to be Cosbys daughter.<ref>{{cite news  first=Benjamin  last=Weiser  url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/16/nyregion/judges-reinstate-conviction-in-extortion-of-bill-cosby.html?ref=autumnjackson title=Judges Reinstate Conviction In Extortion of Bill Cosby newspaper=The New York Times publisher=New York Times Company location=New York City date=November 16, 1999 accessdate=August 16, 2018 }}</ref> Although both Jackson and Cosby stated at various times that they were willing to undergo DNA testing to determine Jacksons paternity, the two sides never reached an agreement as to when and how to perform the test.
