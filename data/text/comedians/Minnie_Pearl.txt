===Professional career===
Her first professional theatrical work was with the Wayne P. Sewell Production Company, a touring theater company based in Atlanta. She produced and directed plays and musical theatre musicals for local organizations in small towns throughout the Southeastern United States Southeast.<ref name=HallofFame/><ref name=CMTbio/>

Part of her work involved making brief appearances at civic organizations to promote the groups shows, and during this time she developed her Minnie Pearl routine.<ref name=CMTbio/> While producing an amateur musical comedy in Baileyton, Alabama she met a mountain woman whose style and talk became the basis for "Cousin Minnie Pearl".<ref name=HallofFame/> Her first stage performance as Minnie Pearl was in 1939 in Aiken, South Carolina.<ref name=HallofFame/> Her now famous hat was purchased downtown at Surasky Bros. Department store before the show. The following year, executives from Nashville radio station WSM (AM) WSM saw her perform at a bankers convention in Centerville and gave her an opportunity to appear on the Grand Ole Opry on November 30, 1940.<ref name=HallofFame/><ref name=CMTbio/> The success of her debut on the show began an association with the Grand Ole Opry that continued for more than 50 years.<ref name = "McCusker">{{cite book  author = Edward T.

Pearls comedy was gentle satire of rural southern United States Southern culture, often called "hillbilly" culture. Pearl always dressed in frilly "down home" dresses and wore a hat with a price tag hanging from it, displaying the $1.98 price. Her signature greeting to her audience was "How-w-w-DEE-E-E-E! Im jest so proud to be here!" delivered in a hearty holler. After she became an established star, her greeting became a call-and-response with audiences everywhere. Pearls often self-deprecating humor involved her unsuccessful attempts to attract "a feller"s attention and, in later years, her age. She also spun stories involving her comical "neer-do-well" relatives, notably "Uncle Nabob", his wife "Aunt Ambrosia", "Lucifer Hucklehead", "Miss Lizzie Tinkum", "Doc Payne", and, of course, her "Brother", who was simultaneously both slow-witted and wise. She usually closed her monologues with the exit line "I love you so much it hurts!" She also sang comic novelty songs and often danced with Grandpa Jones.

Pearl drew much of her comic material from her hometown of Centerville, which she called Grinders Switch. Grinders Switch was a community just outside Centerville that consisted of little more than a railroad switch. Those who knew her recognized that the characters were largely based on actual Centerville residents. So much traffic resulted from fans and tourists looking for Grinders Switch that the Hickman County Highway Department eventually changed the designation on the "Grinders Switch" road sign to "Hickman Springs Road".

Cannon portrayed Minnie Pearl for many years on television, first on American Broadcasting Company ABCs Ozark Jubilee in the late 1950s; then on the long-running television series Hee Haw, both on CBS and the subsequent Television syndication syndicated version. She made several appearances on NBCs The Ford Show The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford. She also appeared as a celebrity panelist on game shows such as Match Game in 1976 and 1978 and Hollywood Squares in 1980. Her last regular performances on national television were on Ralph Emerys Nashville Now country-music talk show on the former SpikeTV The Nashville Network (TNN) cable television cable channel. With Emery, she performed in a weekly feature, "Let Minnie Steal Your Joke", in the Minnie Pearl character and read jokes submitted by viewers, with prizes for the best jokes.<ref name=HallofFame/>

Cannon made a cameo role cameo appearance in the film Coal Miners Daughter (film) Coal Miners Daughter, appearing at the Opry as Minnie Pearl.

===Family life===
On February 23, 1947, Sarah Colley married Henry R. Cannon, who had been an United States Army Air Corps Army Air Corps fighter pilot during World War II and was then a partner in an air charter service. After the marriage, Henry Cannon set up his own air charter service for country music performers and took over management of the Minnie Pearl character.<ref name=HallofFame/><ref name=McCusker/> His clients in the charter service included Eddy Arnold, Colonel Tom Parker, Hank Williams, Carl Smith (country musician) Carl Smith, Webb Pierce, and Elvis Presley.<ref name=HallofFame/> The couple had no children.<ref name=McCusker/> In 1969 they purchased a large estate home in Nashville next door to the Governor of Tennessee Tennessee Governors mansion.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.musiccitypearl.com/  title=MusicCityPearl.com  accessdate=2007-01-17  deadurl=bot: unknown  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122022/http://www.musiccitypearl.com/  archivedate=September 29, 2007  df= }}</ref> Cannon attended Brentwood Methodist Church, just to the south of Nashville, where she also donated the pipe organ.<ref>{{cite web last=Bordsen first=John title=Nashville Country Heres Where The Music Stars Hang Their Hats url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-12-24/travel/0012240131_1_opryland-hotel-grand-ole-opry-briley-parkway/2 work=Dec. 24, 2000 accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref>

===Chicken restaurants===
{{see also List of fast-food chicken restaurants}}
In the late 1960s Nashville entrepreneur John Jay Hooker persuaded Cannon and gospel music gospel singer Mahalia Jackson to lend their names to a Restaurant chain chain of fried chicken restaurants established to compete with Kentucky Fried Chicken. After initially reporting good results and enjoying a public stock worth $64 million, the venture collapsed amid allegations of accounting irregularities and stock price manipulation. The ensuing investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cleared both Cannon and Jackson of involvement in financial wrongdoings, but both were embarrassed by the negative publicity.

===Cancer research===
After battling breast cancer through aggressive treatments, including a double mastectomy and radiation therapy, she became a spokeswoman for the medical center in Nashville where she had been treated. She took on this role as herself, Sarah Ophelia Cannon, not Minnie Pearl, although a nonprofit group, the Minnie Pearl Cancer Foundation, was founded in her memory to help fund cancer research. The center where she was treated was later named the Sarah Cannon Cancer Center, and has been expanded to several other hospitals in Middle Tennessee and southern Kentucky. Her name has also been lent to the affiliated Sarah Cannon Research Institute.<ref>[https://www.pearlpoint.org/about-us/our-story the PearlPoint foundation] and [http://sarahcannon.com/ the SarahCannon.com web site.]</ref>

===Final years===
Pearl suffered a debilitating stroke in June 1991,<ref name=HallofFame/> bringing her performing career to an end. After the stroke, she resided in a Nashville nursing home, where she received frequent visits from country-music industry figures, including Chely Wright, Vince Gill, and Amy Grant. Her death on March 4, 1996 at the age of 83, was attributed to complications from another stroke. She is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Franklin, Tennessee.

==Legacy and influence==
She was an important influence on younger female country music singers and rural humorists such as Jerry Clower, Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Carl Hurley, David L Cook, Chonda Pierce, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy. In 1992, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts. In 2002, she was ranked as number 14 on Country Music Television CMTs 40 Greatest Women in Country Music list.{{Citation needed date=October 2010}}

The Bands song "Ophelia (The Band song) Ophelia" was based on Pearl.

She was friends with performers outside the country genre, including Elvis Presley, Dean Martin (she appeared on an episode of The Dean Martin Show), and Paul Reubens (Pee-wee Herman).<ref>[http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/questionaire.aspx?csid1=65 Paul Reubens interview] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005050241/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/questionaire.aspx?csid1=65  date=2008-10-05 }}</ref> In 1992, Reubens made what would be his last appearance as Pee-wee Herman for 15 years at a Minnie Pearl tribute show.<ref>Robert Lloyd, [http://articles.latimes.com/p/2006/jul/10/entertainment/et-peewee Pee-wee’s Back in the Limelight], Los Angeles Times, July 10, 2006</ref>

Bronze statues of Minnie Pearl and Roy Acuff are displayed in the lobby of the Ryman Auditorium. Chely Wright and Dean Sams (of Lonestar) posed for the statues.{{citation needed date=September 2017}}

A museum dedicated to Minnie Pearl was situated just outside the Grand Ole Opry House at Opryland USA (next to another museum dedicated to Roy Acuff), but the museum closed along with the theme park in 1997. Many of its artifacts were moved to the adjacent Grand Ole Opry Museum.<!-- , some of which may have been damaged in the 2010 Tennessee floods.{{citation needed date=January 2013}} -->
