== Career ==
Diamond began acting as a child.

Continuing the series into college, Saved by the Bell: The College Years shows most of the cast transplanted into not only the same college, but also the same college dormitory, where Screech continued his typical misadventures. The College Years was canceled after one season. Diamond returned to Bayside High as Principal Beldings assistant in The New Class episodes, remaining with the show until its cancellation.
