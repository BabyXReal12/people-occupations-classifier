===Behind the Bell===
In 2009, Diamond published an inside story of the shows cast and crew, from his point of view, titled Behind the Bell.
The book paints an unflattering portrait of many of Diamonds colleagues and their alleged, sordid backstage behavior; some of these claims have been refuted by Diamonds colleagues and questioned by critics.
Diamond also alleges, in the book, that he has had sex with 2,000 women, one of them NBCs VP of childrens programming, Linda Mancuso, who was 18 years his senior.
Diamonds former co-stars were highly critical of the book and Mark-Paul Gosselaar stated that his own experiences with the show were positive and did not see where any of the books negative claims actually occurred on set.

Diamond later commented on the books content in a December 2013 appearance on a "Where Are They Now" segment on the Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel) OWN Network in which he stated that the book was ghost written by an author who simply interviewed him and compiled the book from his answers. He claimed that many parts of the book, such as allegations of teen sex and drug use, were fabricated from very minor statements he made during the interviews, such as his remark, "Yeah, there were a bunch of kids on set with hormones so...what do you think?"
===Other work===
He is also a musician and formed an alternative metal band called Salty The Pocketknife. Diamond played bass and wrote much of the music as well. Shortly after recording their first album, the band split up due to internal disagreements.
