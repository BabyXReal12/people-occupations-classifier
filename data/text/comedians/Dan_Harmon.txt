=="Story Circle" technique==

File:Embryo-dan-harmon-600x364.jpg 300px thumb right alt=A hand-drawn version of Harmons story circle. Harmons illustrated story technique
Harmon has invented a storytelling framework referred to as the "Story Circle."
He began developing the technique in the late ’90s, while stuck on a screenplay. He wanted to codify the storytelling process — to find the structure powering movies and TV shows. "I was thinking, there must be some symmetry to this," Harmon told Wired. "Some simplicity."
While working on Channel 101, Harmon found that many of the directors he was working with claimed that they were unable to write plots for television shows.
This caused Harmon to distill Joseph Campbells structure of the Monomyth into a simple, circular eight-step process that would reliably produce coherent stories.

The story circle supposedly can be applied to all stories. Harmon uses it whenever hes writing a new story, saying "I cant not see that circle. Its tattooed on my brain."
The circle is divided into eight segments, each representing a stage of the plot. A character is introduced, wants something, enters a new environment, adapts to that environment, achieves their goal but encounters problems as a result, leaves that world and changes as a result. The steps are as follows:
# A character is in a zone of comfort or familiarity.
# They desire something.
# They enter an unfamiliar situation.
# They adapt to that situation.
# They get that which they wanted.
# They pay a heavy price for it.
# They return to their familiar situation.
# They have changed as a result of the journey.

Joseph Campbells structure of the Monomyth is the main influence in Harmons technique. In a blog post detailing the second sector of the circle Harmon explains, "The point of this part of the circle is, our protagonist has been thrown into the water and now its sink or swim. In Hero with a Thousand Faces, Campbell actually evokes the image of a digestive tract, breaking the hero down, divesting him of neuroses, stripping him of fear and desire. Theres no room for bullshit in the unconscious basement. Asthma inhalers, eyeglasses, credit cards, fratty boyfriends, promotions, toupees and cell phones cant save you here. The purpose here has become refreshingly - and frighteningly - simple."
The Monomyth has been adapted for screen and television writing before, most notably by former Disney developmental executive Christopher Vogler in his book The Writers Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers. Harmon has noted this book as an influence on the embryo technique, as well as the work of Syd Field.
Harmon states that this circular structure of storytelling can be applied both to film and TV, suggesting in a Channel 101 blog that only the final intentions are different. "A feature film’s job is to send you out of the theatre on a high in 90 minutes. Television’s job is to keep you glued to the television for your entire life. This doesn’t entail making stories any less circular (TV circles are so circular they’re sometimes irritatingly predictable). It just means that the focus of step 8 is less riling-things-up and more getting-things-back-to-where-they-started," he says.{{citation needed date=February 2017}} Harmon has used the Story Embryo technique extensively throughout projects such as Community
and Rick and Morty.
In an interview on Collider (website) Collider writer, Adam Chitwood said, "The show [Rick and Morty] debuted in 2013 to a serious degree of anticipation, as it marked a new animated venture for Community creator Dan Harmon, but it was the marriage of Harmon’s adeptness for structure and character and co-creator Justin Roilands insanely creative/sometimes insane mind that made Rick and Morty much more than just another animated TV series for adults."

Fans and critics have retroactively applied Harmons Story Circle to other shows, such as Breaking Bad.
Harmons technique has been adopted by Irish sitcom writer Graham Linehan, the creator of shows such as Father Ted, The IT Crowd, and Black Books. In an interview with the Telegraph, Linehan said: "Whenever I write for television, I plan the story on whiteboard wallpaper in my office, using a system created by the American writer Dan Harmon, saying, Its remarkably simple: a character wants something; they enter a new world and adapt to it; they get what they want, re-enter the old world and change. The great thing about it is that once you have an idea for one bit, the section opposite comes naturally, as do the ones on either side, and so on. Its basically a distillation of the heros journey idea, but it’s undetectable and applies to any ideas, big or small."
==Awards==
In July 2009, Harmon was nominated in two Emmy categories for his part in writing the Oscar telecast: Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Special and Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics, the latter of which he was awarded for "Hugh Jackman Opening Number" at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards.

==Personal life==
In 2011, while writing the character Abed for Community, Dan discovered he might have a form of Asperger syndrome.
In December 2013, Harmon proposed to his girlfriend Erin McGathy.
The two married in November 2014.
They announced they were divorcing in October 2015.
=== Misconduct ===
On January 2, 2018, Dan Harmon alluded to misconduct from himself towards other people. Megan Ganz, a writer who worked with Harmon on Community responded, naming herself as a victim in said misconduct. Harmon responded by attempting a dialogue with Ganz, wherein he attempted to apologize, and though Ganz said she appreciated his gestures, she declined to forgive him.
After the exchange, Harmon made a lengthy apology on his podcast Harmontown where he went into detail about his wrongdoings which included making advances on her and then mistreating her after she turned him down. Ganz said that she felt vindicated by the admission and accepted his apology, saying "Dan Harmon, I forgive you".
=== Baby doll video controversy ===
In July 2018, Harmon deleted his Twitter account after a 2009 comedy skit surfaced in which acted out a rape using a baby doll as a prop. The video, titled "Daryl" was intended to be parody of the Dexter (TV series) Dexter TV series. Harmon later apologized for the video. Nearly a day after the video surfaced, Adult Swim released a statement criticizing the video while noting Harmons apology.
