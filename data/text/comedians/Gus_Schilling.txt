August "Gus" Schilling (June 20, 1908 — June 16, 1957) was an American film actor who started in burlesque comedy and usually played nervous comic roles, often unbilled. A friend of Orson Welles, he appeared in five of the directors films — Citizen Kane (first screen performance), The Magnificent Ambersons (film) The Magnificent Ambersons, The Lady from Shanghai, Macbeth (1948 film) Macbeth and Touch of Evil (final performance, released posthumously).
==Career==
Born in New York City, Schilling had a rubber face and flustered gestures which made him a natural comedian and he began his career understudying comedy stars Bert Lahr and Joe Penner on Broadway. He soon became a favorite among burlesque comedians, who welcomed him into the burlesque profession. Schilling married burlesque star Betty Rowland and the couple toured in the Minskys Burlesque Minsky burlesque troupe.

Orson Welles saw Schilling in New York and followed him to Florida. There Welles hired Schilling to appear in a stage production featuring several Shakespearean scenes. "I learned my part by taking the script to Welles and having him translate the lines to everyday English," Schilling recalled in 1939. Welles promised Schilling a part in Welless first motion picture, and kept his promise: Schilling is featured in Citizen Kane (1941).
This established Schilling in Hollywood movies as a "nervous" comedian (he plays a jittery symphony conductor in Olsen and Johnsons Hellzapoppin (musical) Hellzapoppin, for example). He also co-starred with character comedian Richard Lane (actor) Richard Lane in a series of 11 comedy shorts for Columbia Pictures; the series ran from 1945 to 1950.
==Personal life==
In July 1945 Schilling was arrested in Hollywood on charges of possession of narcotics. At his trial he testified that he admitted ownership of the marijuana to save his wife from arrest. The all-woman jury acquitted Schilling on November 29.
Schillings marriage to Betty Rowland ended in divorce. His professional career remained successful, and he worked in movies and television throughout the 1950s. His final film, Welless Touch of Evil, in which he has a brief uncredited appearance, was released in May 1958, nearly a year after his death.

Schilling died of a heart attack in his Hollywood apartment,
four days short of his 49th birthday.
