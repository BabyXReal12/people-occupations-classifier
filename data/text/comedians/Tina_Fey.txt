Fey was exposed to comedy early:

{{quote I remember my parents sneaking me in to see Young Frankenstein. We would also watch Saturday Night Live, or Monty Python, or old Marx Brothers movies. My dad would let us stay up late to watch The Honeymooners. We were not allowed to watch The Flintstones though: my dad hated it because it ripped off The Honeymooners.
I actually have a very low level of Flintstones knowledge for someone my age.
}}

She was hired as a writer
for SNL following a meeting with SNL creator Lorne Michaels, and moved to New York from Chicago.
Fey told The New Yorker, "Id had my eye on the show forever, the way other kids have their eye on Derek Jeter."

and after watching herself, decided to diet
and lost 30 pounds. She told The New York Times, "I was a completely normal weight, but I was here in New York City, I had money and I couldnt buy any clothes. After I lost weight, there was interest in putting me on camera."
In 1999, McKay stepped down as head writer, which led Michaels to approach Fey for the position.
She became SNL
s first female head writer.
In 2000, Fey began performing in sketches,
and she and Jimmy Fallon became news anchor co-anchors of Weekend Update SNLs Weekend Update segment.
Fey said she did not ask to audition, but that Michaels approached her.

though  the decision was "kind of risky" at the time.
Her role in Weekend Update was well received by critics. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: "...Fey delivers such blow darts – poison filled jokes written in long, precisely parsed sentences unprecedented in Update history – with such a bright, sunny countenance makes her all the more devilishly delightful."
Dennis Miller, a former cast member of SNL and anchor of Weekend Update, was pleased with Fey as one of the anchors for the segment: "...Fey might be the best Weekend Update anchor who ever did it. She writes the funniest jokes".

The Saturday Night Live (season 31) 2005–2006 season was her last; she departed to develop 30 Rock for Broadway Video.
At the time she left, the 117 episodes she co-hosted made her SNLs longest-serving Weekend Update anchor, a mark that would later be passed by her replacement, Seth Meyers.  In Rolling Stone{{}}s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 SNL cast members to date, Fey was ranked third in importance (behind John Belushi and Eddie Murphy).

==Comedic and acting style==
Fey is known for her deadpan humor and delivery;
her "sardonic wit" has become a trademark of hers,
upon which several critics have commented in their reviews of Feys work.
According to Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara, Fey "project[s] both oblivious security and hyper-alert insecurity with the same expression" in her performances,
while The Chronicle (Duke University) The Chronicle
s Dillon Fernando wrote that the actress specializes in "delectable, situational and Irony ironic comedy".
On Feys comedic prowess, Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels enthused that his former employee "has a very clear take on things ... It always comes from a place of intelligence and there is just an edge to it."
Michaels concluded, "Its not fearful. Its strong and confident and you recognise the voice and most of the time you agree with it."
Writing for The Guardian, Christopher Goodwin believes that Fey "fashioned her comic persona around her glasses", which she has worn since 1995; Fey joked that "Glasses make anyone look smarter".
Seldom hesitating to use herself as the butt of her own jokes,
Fey is also well known for practicing self-deprecating humor,
as demonstrated throughout her performance as Liz Lemon in 30 Rock.
In an article ranking Feys six greatest jokes, David Renshaw of The Guardian wrote that the performers work continues to feature her "trademark mix of snark, self-deprecation and pop-culture smarts."
Feys self-deprecating comedic style inspired Ashley Fetters of The Atlantic to recognize her as comedian Phyllis Dillers successor because of their similar humor.
Critics have been divided in their opinions and discussions of Feys use of self-deprecating humor, and its effect on women as a female comic; while blogger Kate Harding disapproved of Feys performance in 30 Rock because "Im torn between being sad that she apparently doesnt see [beauty] in herself and being pissed off that shes reinforcing the idea that having brown hair, glasses, and a figure thats maybe a size 2 instead of a 0 actually equals ugly", Jessica G. of Jezebel (website) Jezebel defended the actress, writing that Feys performance is "supposed to be parodying precisely the kinds of media that reinforce ideas that unconventional women are unworthy."
Writing that Harding misunderstood Feys intentions, the author concluded that her self-deprecation "is precisely what makes her relatable", elaborating that "[women] have many moments of self-doubt, and seeing someone as successful as Tina Fey be self-deprecating gives us all permission to be imperfect."
Sophie Caldecott of Verily defended Feys modesty and tendency to downplay her own physical appearance: "She mocks her own appearance, sure, but she does so in a way that consistently shows up our culture for placing so much importance on how women look, as if that’s the most interesting thing about us ... Her comic persona on 30 Rock, Liz Lemon, can be laughed at for many things, but her career managerial style and ability is not one of them."
Caldecott concluded, "In reality, self-deprecation is an art that comedians everywhere dabble in ... In fact, I defy you to find a good male comedian who isn’t a master of self-deprecation. Comedians make fun of themselves for many reasons, mostly because it is the most readily accessible source of inspiration but also because it is the most generous one."
Observing that Feys material lacks "whining", Gina Barreca of the Hartford Courant wrote that Feys comedy "is not simply an iteration of self-deprecating femininity passing itself off as humor. In itself, this demarcates the current generation of female humorists from earlier generations of performers who were told, more or less, to use themselves not as a sounding board for ideas but as a punching bag for insults."
Fey has also garnered criticism for being politically incorrect, but she defends her right to write borderline jokes, saying that she has chosen to "opt out" of the culture of demanding apologies.
As an actress, Fey has developed a reputation for portraying "the hilarious, self-deprecating unmarried career woman" in most of her films to-date.
The Boston Globe
s Janice Paige defended her limited filmography by writing that, unlike most film actors, Fey remains "realistic about her range as a leading lady and says she’s been deliberate about only taking on parts for which she actually seems suited."
Fey explained that she approaches each role asking herself, "Would I be plausible in this role, in this job?"
However, her role as Kate Ellis in 2015s Sisters provided Fey with an opportunity to stray from playing the Type a personality type-A female characters for which she has become known.
The New York Times film critic A. O. Scott wrote, "We’re used to seeing Ms. Fey ... as an anxious overthinker using her caustic sarcasm as a weapon against both her own insecurities and the flakes and train wrecks who surround her. This time, she gets to be the train wreck."
In 30 Rock, Feys comedic acting was heavily influenced by both Physical comedy physical and improvisational comedy while, as a writer, her "carefully written scripts" were often quirky and character-driven.
