==Biography==

===Early life===
Moran was born in Navan, County Meath, Republic of Ireland Ireland.
He attended St. Patricks Classical School, where he experimented early on with standup, with fellow comics Tommy Tiernan and Hector Ó hEochagáin, and left at age 16
with his Irish Leaving Certificate Leaving Certificate. After leaving school, it has been said that Moran spent four years unemployed "drinking and writing bad poetry".
At one point, Moran worked as a florist but quit after a week because he hated the job.
===Career===

Dylan Moran came to comedy at age 20 after watching Ardal OHanlon and other comedians perform at Dublins International Comedy Cellar Comedy Cellar, a small fifty-seater comedy club with no microphone in the basement of The International Bar on South Wicklow Street. He began his stand up there in 1992 and, although nervous, got a good reception.
In 1993, he won the So You Think Youre Funny award at the Edinburgh Festival. He went on to become the youngest person to win the Perrier Comedy Award in 1996 at the Edinburgh Festival at age 24.
Gurgling For Money was Morans first major one man stand up UK tour in 1997. He went on to perform at many other festivals including the Hay Festival, Just for laughs Montreal comedy festival, Vancouver Comedy Festival and the Edinburgh Festival. Between 1995 and 1997 Moran wrote a weekly column for The Irish Times.

Moran won his first major television role in 1998 playing Ian Lyons in the BBC 2 sitcom How Do You Want Me?, with Charlotte Coleman.
He went on to appear in a small role in the 1999 movie Notting Hill (film) Notting Hill as Rufus the thief. In 2000, Black Books was launched on Channel 4. The sitcom, about a depressed, bitter, alcoholic, chain-smoking, and misanthropic book shop owner, Bernard Black, was based on a dream Moran had in the mid eighties during a weekend away in Limerick{{Citation needed reason=No current citation to confirm this, and in an article on the Channel 4 website Moran is quoted as saying "I don’t remember where the idea came from" date=August 2018}}. It was brought into existence with the aid of co-writer and fellow Irishman Graham Linehan, and producers Mark Buckley and Albert Kenny of Kenley Studios. The second series was televised in 2002, and the third, which aired in 2004, was greeted with great enthusiasm by critics and fans alike.
In the same year Moran appeared in his first major film role playing David in the horror comedy, Shaun of the Dead.

Moran toured his new shows Monster I and Monster II in 2004, including performances in New York and Milan, as well as a tour across Britain and Ireland, culminating in a week-long run at Londons Palace Theatre, London Palace Theatre, before two shows at Dublins Vicar Street, and finally an appearance at the Hay Festival. The tour was described by The Times as a "masterclass of comic charisma: swinging from topic to topic in a manner seemingly spontaneous but actually tightly organised".
A live DVD of the Monster II tour, filmed on 28 May at Dublins Vicar Street, was released that year, as Morans first live stand-up DVD. After a successful run in New York City in 2004 as part of the British/Irish Comedy Invasion (including performances by top British and Irish comedians such as Eddie Izzard, fellow Black Books star Bill Bailey and Irish comedian Tommy Tiernan) Moran returned to New York for a month-long run at the Village Theatre. He then performed a two-week London West End of London West End run at the Wyndhams Theatre, 1–13 November 2004.

His third major tour, Like, Totally, opened at the Buxton Opera House on 3 May 2005,
and as with his previous tours the stand-up routine was accompanied by projected cartoons drawn by Moran. A DVD of the tour was released in December 2005. Moran appeared as the character of Gordon in the comedy film Run Fatboy Run, released in September 2007 which cast Moran as the best friend to Dennis (Shaun of the Dead co-star Simon Pegg), having played an adversary to Peggs character in Shaun of the Dead.

In June 2008, Moran appeared with Ardal OHanlon and Tommy Tiernan at the Echo Arena in The Three Fellas,
a one-off comedy event, part of the citys European Capital of Culture 2008 celebrations. Between October and December 2008, Moran embarked on a new UK tour entitled What It Is, starting at the Grand Opera House (York) Grand Opera House in York, and ending at Oxfords New Theatre. Other notable venues include Colston Hall at Bristol, Nottinghams Nottingham Royal Concert Hall Royal Concert Hall, the Waterfront Hall Auditorium in Belfast and the Corran Halls in Oban. The tour was extended into 2009 and has now been released on DVD.

A compilation DVD of highlights from Morans three previous stand up shows was made available in November 2010 called Dylan Moran: Aim Low.

Yeah, Yeah, a stand-up tour of Scandinavia, the Baltic states, United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the UK began in April 2011.

In 2012, Moran performed shows in Russia (following two sold-out performances in neighbouring Estonia
).  The shows promoters indicated that they believed it to be the first time an Irish stand-up had performed live in a Russian venue; his routine referenced Russias new law banning "homosexual propaganda" and jailed oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
Moran has written a pilot for ABC about "news media and conflict, war zones and cable news". ABC has however, decided not to go ahead with the show but may possibly sell it to another network.
In July 2015, Moran took his latest stand-up show, "Off The Hook", to South Africa for the first time, performing three sold-out shows at the countrys National Arts Festival.
===Awards and commendations===
At the Edinburgh Festival Fringe he has won the So You Think Youre Funny? Award in 1993, and the Perrier Award in 1996, but later dismissed the latter as "a load of media rubbish," stating Bill Bailey deserved it more.

A popular poll commissioned by Channel 4 ranked him the 14th Greatest Comedy Stand-up.
Moran was declared "the greatest comedian, living or dead" by the French newspaper Le Monde in July 2007.
He has also twice won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Situation Comedy, both for Black Books.
