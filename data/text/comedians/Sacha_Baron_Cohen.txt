Ali Gs interviews with celebrities (often politicians) gained notoriety partly because the subjects were not privy to the joke that Ali G, rather than being a real interviewer, was a comic character played by Baron Cohen. According to Rolling Stone magazine, Baron Cohen would always enter the interview area in character as Ali G, carrying equipment and appearing to be an inconspicuous crew member. He would arrive with a suited man, whom the interviewee naturally thought was the interviewer. Baron Cohen, as Ali G, would sit down to begin conducting the interview by asking the interviewee some preliminary questions. The interviewee, however, would remain under the impression that the smartly-dressed director would be conducting the interview until short notice prior to cameras rolling: this would grant an advantage of surprise, whereby the interviewee would be less likely to opt out of the Ali interview prior to its start.<ref name=manbehindmustache>{{cite news last =Strauss first =Neil author2 = title =The man behind the mustache pages = work =Rolling Stone date =14 November 2006 url =https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/sacha_baron_cohen_the_real_borat_finally_speaks accessdate =14 August 2008 deadurl =yes archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070102223451/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/sacha_baron_cohen_the_real_borat_finally_speaks archivedate =2 January 2007 df =dmy-all}}</ref>

Another alter ego Sacha Baron Cohen performed as is Brüno (character) Brüno, a flamboyantly gay, Austrian fashion show presenter who often lures his unwitting subjects into making provocative statements and engaging in embarrassing behaviour, as well as leading them to contradict themselves, often in the same interview. Brüno asks the subjects to answer "yes or no" questions with either "Vassup" (whats up) or "Ich dont think so" (No); these are occasionally substituted with "Ach, ja!" (Ah yes!) or "Nicht, nicht" ("Nicht" means "not" in German). In one segment on Da Ali&nbsp;G Show, he encouraged his guest to answer questions with either "Keep them in the ghetto" or "Train to Auschwitz concentration camp Auschwitz".

Brünos main comedic satire pertains to the vacuity and inanity of the fashion and Clubbing (subculture) clubbing world. In May 2009, at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards MTV Movie Awards, Baron Cohen appeared as Brüno wearing a white angel costume, a white jockstrap, white go-go boots, and white wings; and did an aerial stunt where he dropped from a height (using wires) onto Eminem.

===Erran Morad===
{{Main Who Is America?}}

Baron Cohen portrays various characters in Who Is America?, with the most prominent and controversial being Erran Morad, an Israeli anti-terrorism expert. The character is referred to as either colonel (and later captain, general, sergeant, and brigadier) in the Israeli military, and not a former agent of Mossad. Before Who Is America? aired on Showtime, some conservative public figures made statements saying that Baron Cohen had deceived them while in character.<ref>{{cite web  last1=Pedersen  first1=Erik  title=Sacha Baron Cohen Also Duped Ex-Congressman Joe Walsh&nbsp;– Whos Not Thrilled About It  url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-duped-joe-walsh-who-is-america-showtime-1202424785/  website=Deadline Hollywood  accessdate=July 11, 2018  date=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  last1=Haring  first1=Bruce  title=Sacha Baron Cohen Adds Alabama Judge Roy Moore To His Showtime Spoof Victims  url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/sacha-baron-cohen-adds-alabama-judge-roy-moore-to-his-showtime-spoof-victims-1202425938/  website=Deadline Hollywood  accessdate=July 12, 2018  date=July 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  last1=Resnick  first1=Gideon  title=Sacha Baron Cohens Latest Victim Is GOP Rep.

He also interviews other conservatives, such as Dana Rohrabacher, Joe Wilson (American politician) Joe Wilson, and Joe Walsh (Illinois politician) Joe Walsh, who are openly supportive. Only Matt Gaetz expresses skepticism of Morads proposal, and declines to be in his video.

In the second episode, Morad teaches Jason Spencer, a Republican state representative from Georgia, how to detect and repel terrorists by taking pictures up a womans burqua with a selfie stick, walking backwards while baring his buttocks, and yelling racial epithets. After the airing of the episode, Spencer refused to step down, stating that he was exploited by the producers, but he eventually did on July 31, 2018, leaving the seat vacant.<ref>{{cite web url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/25/entertainment/jason-spencer-who-is-america-resigns/index.html title=Georgia lawmaker who came under fire after yelling n-word on Who Is America? says hell quit first=Lisa last=Respers France publisher=CNN accessdate=July 25, 2018}}</ref> In May 2018, Spencer lost his primary to a political novice, Steven Sainz, but was expected to serve the rest of his term until November.

Baron Cohen has been criticised for the racist or prejudiced comments his characters have made (see Da Ali G Show#Controversy Da Ali G Show). HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer has replied to criticism concerning Baron Cohens characters, "Through his alter-egos, he delivers an obvious satire that exposes peoples ignorance and prejudice in much the same way All in the Family did years ago."<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=9732  title=Did Ali G Go Too Far? first=Liel last=Leibovitz work=The Jewish Week location=New York date=26 August 2004 accessdate=10 February 2012 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040826111026/http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=9732 archivedate=26 August 2004}}</ref> Regarding his portrayal as the anti-Semitic Borat, Baron Cohen says the segments are a "dramatic demonstration of how racism feeds on dumb conformity, as much as rabid bigotry", rather than a display of racism by Baron Cohen himself.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070323100516/https://movies.yahoo.com/mv/news/va/20060908/115774501000.html title=Yahoo!

By himself being anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice", Baron Cohen explains.<ref name=rollingstone/> Addressing the same topic in an NPR interview with Robert Siegel, Baron Cohen said "I think thats quite an interesting thing with Borat, which is people really let down their guard with him because theyre in a room with somebody who seems to have these outrageous opinions. They sometimes feel much more relaxed about letting their own outrageous, politically incorrect, prejudiced opinions come out."<ref name=npr1>{{cite news url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3613548 first=Robert last=Siegel title=Ali G: Fooling Serious Interviewees, All for a Laugh publisher=NPR  date=23 July 2004  accessdate=31 July 2010}}</ref>

Baron Cohen, the grandson of a Holocaust survivor, says he also wishes in particular to expose the role of indifference in that genocide. "When I was in university, there was this major historian of the Third Reich, Ian Kershaw, who said, The path to Auschwitz was paved with indifference. I know its not very funny being a comedian talking about the Holocaust, but its an interesting idea that not everyone in Germany had to be a raving anti-Semite. They just had to be apathetic."<ref name=rollingstone/> Regarding the enthusiastic response to his song, "In My Country There Is Problem" (also known as "Throw the Jew Down the Well"), he says, "Did it reveal that they were anti-Semitic? Perhaps. But maybe it just revealed that they were indifferent to anti-Semitism."<ref name=rollingstone/>

Baron Cohen walked onto the runway during the Ágatha Ruiz de la Prada fashion show in Milan on 26 September 2008. In the character of one of his alter-egos Brüno, he was wearing a costume made out of velcro. He appeared on the stage with a blanket and items of clothing stuck to his velcro suit. Lights were turned off while security intervened and escorted him off the stage, and the fashion show resumed normally shortly thereafter. Baron Cohen and his team allegedly accessed the fashion show using fake IDs.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080929202711/http://omg.yahoo.com/news/sacha-baron-cohen-kicked-out-of-milan-fashion-week/13579 title=Sacha Baron Cohen Kicked Out of Milan Fashion Week – omg! news on Yahoo! date=2008-09-29 access-date=2018-08-07}}</ref>

===Lawsuits===
The government of Kazakhstan threatened Baron Cohen with legal action following the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony in Lisbon, and the authority in charge of the countrys country-code top-level domain name removed the website that he had created for his character Borat (previously: <nowiki>http://www.borat.kz)</nowiki> for alleged violation of the law—specifically, registering for the domain under a false name.

Baron Cohen encountered another problem around his Borat character. Two of the three University of South Carolina students who appear in Borat sued the filmmakers, alleging that they were duped into signing release forms while drunk, and that false promises were made that the footage was for a documentary that would never be screened in the US. On 11 December 2006, a Los Angeles judge denied the pair a restraining order to remove them from the film. The lawsuit was dismissed in February 2007.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://defamer.com/hollywood/celeb-jurisprudence/borat-frat-boys-lawsuit-dismissed-by-judge-who-secretly-knows-sacha-baron-cohens-golden-globes-speech-by-heart-237454.php  title=Borat Frat Boys Lawsuit Dismissed By Judge Who Secretly Knows Sacha Baron Cohens Golden Globes Speech By Heart  publisher=Defamer.com  date=16 February 2007  accessdate=31 July 2010  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201171926/http://defamer.com/hollywood/celeb-jurisprudence/borat-frat-boys-lawsuit-dismissed-by-judge-who-secretly-knows-sacha-baron-cohens-golden-globes-speech-by-heart-237454.php  archivedate=1 February 2009  }}</ref>
