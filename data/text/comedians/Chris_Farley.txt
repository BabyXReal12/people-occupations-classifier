==Career==

===Saturday Night Live===
Along with Chris Rock, Farley was one of the new Saturday Night Live cast members announced in the spring of 1990.<ref name="yahoo"/><ref name="whs"/> On SNL, Farley frequently collaborated with fellow cast members Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Rob Schneider, and David Spade, among others. This group came to be known as the "Bad Boys of SNL."<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0500191/  title=The Bad Boys of Saturday Night Live (1998) (TV) website=IMDb.com accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref>

Popular characters performed by Farley included Matt Foley, an over-the-top motivational speaker who constantly reminded other characters that he "lived in a van, down by the river." The name of the character was drawn from an actual friend of Farley who, during a troubled period, lived in a van near a river. The real Matt Foley later became a Catholic priest and appeared in the 2015 documentary I am Chris Farley.

In early renditions of the character, Farley used other names, depending on whom he knew in the audience, until the real-life Foley went to the show and had his name used, at which point Farley felt the name best suited the character and refused to change it. Some of the mannerisms of the character were a combination of the positions Farley noticed his rugby teammates took on the pitch coupled with the angry and high-pitched, yet low volume/muffled voice his father used when he was angry.<ref name="dada">{{cite news first=Sam last=Anderson url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/reviews/47039 title=Dada’s Boy work=New York (magazine) New York publisher=New York Media location=New York City date=May 16, 2008 accessdate=June 8, 2008}}</ref>

Other famous Farley characters included Todd OConnor of Bill Swerskis Superfans, a group of stereotypical Chicagoans who constantly shouted Chicago Bears "da Bears!";<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/highlights/archives/2008/05/farley_exhibit.asp title=New Exhibit: Chris Farley Remembered publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society accessdate=June 8, 2008}}</ref> a Chippendales dancers Chippendales dancer, in a famous sketch that paired him with guest host Patrick Swayze;<ref name=cnn>{{cite news first=Henry last=Goldblatt url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/books/05/07/chris.farley title=Chris Farley Show stuffed with gossip publisher=CNN  location=Atlanta, Georgia date=May 7, 2008 accessdate=June 8, 2008}}</ref> one of the "Gap Girls", who hung out together at a local mall; a stereotypical lunch lady, to the theme of Lunchlady Land performed by Adam Sandler;<ref>{{cite book first=Bill last=Crawford title=Adam Sandler: Americas Comedian publisher=Macmillan Publishers Macmillan location=New York City date=2000 page=75 isbn=0-312-26282-5}}</ref> Bennett Brauer, a Weekend Update commentator who often divulged his personal and hygienic problems via air quotes; and himself on The Chris Farley Show, a talk show in which Farley quite often "interviewed" the guest, regularly getting very nervous.

Some of these characters were brought to SNL from his days at Second City. Farley also performed impersonations of Tom Arnold (actor) Tom Arnold (who gave Farleys eulogy at his private funeral), Andrew Giuliani, Jerry Garcia, Meat Loaf, Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr. Norman Schwarzkopf, Dom DeLuise, Roger Ebert, Carnie Wilson, Newt Gingrich, Mindy Cohn, Mama Cass, Hank Williams Jr., and Rush Limbaugh.<ref name=wisconsin>{{cite web url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/artifacts/archives/003176.asp title=Chris Farleys Black Sheep Jacket publisher=wisconsinhistory.org accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref>

Off screen, Farley was well known for his pranks in the offices of Saturday Night Live. Sandler and Farley would make late-night prank phone calls from the SNL offices in Rockefeller Center, with Sandler speaking in an old womans voice and Farley farting into the phone and mooning cars from a limousine, and even once defecation defecating out a window. He was also known to frequently get naked and do various stunts for laughs. Chris Rock once claimed that he probably saw Farleys private parts more than Farleys girlfriend did.<ref>{{cite news url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/47548/index6.html title=Comedy Isn’t Funny last=Smith first=Chris date=1995-03-15 publisher=New York page=7 accessdate=2008-06-08}}</ref><ref>Shales T. and Miller J.A.

===Film career===
During his time on SNL, Farley appeared in the comedy films Waynes World (film) Waynes World,<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/10-things-that-the-waynes-world-movies-gave-us-6396262 title=10 Things That the Waynes World Movies Gave Us last=Hlavaty first=Craig work=Houston Press date=2012-02-17 accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref> Coneheads (film) Coneheads,<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/coneheadspghowe_a0afe0.htm title=Coneheads last=Howe first=Desson work=The Washington Post date=1993-07-23 accessdate=2016-09-25}}</ref> Airheads,<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501E5DA1031F936A3575BC0A962958260 title=FILM REVIEW; Airheads.

After Farley and most of his fellow cast members were released from their contracts at Saturday Night Live following the Saturday Night Live (season 20) 1994–1995 season, Farley began focusing on his film career. His first two major films co starred his fellow SNL colleague and close friend David Spade. Together, the duo made the films Tommy Boy (film) Tommy Boy and Black Sheep (1996 film) Black Sheep. These were a success at the domestic box office, earning around $32 million each and gaining a large cult following on home video.<ref>{{cite web url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=blacksheep.htm title=Box Office Mojo data for &#39;Black Sheep&#39; publisher=Boxofficemojo.com date=1996-03-15 accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tommyboy.htm title=Box Office Mojo data for &#39;Tommy Boy&#39; publisher=Boxofficemojo.com date=1995-05-16 accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref>

The two films established Farley as a relatively bankable star and he was given the title role of Beverly Hills Ninja, which finished in first place at the box office on its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=beverlyhillsninja.htm title=Box Office Mojo data for Beverly Hills Ninja publisher=Boxofficemojo.com date=1997-01-17 accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref> Drug and alcohol abuse related problems interfered with Farleys film work at this time. Production of his final film, Almost Heroes, was held up several times so Farley could enter rehab. He was known among comedic contemporaries and friends to be sensitive about how his comedy was perceived ("fatty falls down, everybody goes home happy"), and was particularly hurt by harsh critical reactions to Tommy Boy, a film he enjoyed making.

He was particularly dissatisfied with Black Sheep, an attempt by the studio to recapture the chemistry on Tommy Boy, and was only 60 pages into the script when the project was green lit. As a result, he relapsed on the night of the premiere, which required further rehab before he could begin work on Beverly Hills Ninja.<ref name=nypost>{{cite news url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12162007/entertainment/that_was_awesome__816891.htm?page=0 title=That Was Awesome! last=Tucker first=Reed date=2007-12-16 publisher=New York Post accessdate=2008-06-07}}</ref> After his death on December 18, 1997, his final completed films, Almost Heroes and Dirty Work (1998 film) Dirty Work, were released posthumously in the summer of 1998.

Farley was obese for much of his life and at the time of his death weighed 296 pounds and stood only 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 cm).
