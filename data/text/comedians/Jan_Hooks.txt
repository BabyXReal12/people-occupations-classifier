Hooks was considered for SNL in 1985, but was passed over by the shows producers in favor of Joan Cusack. After the shows 1985–1986 season was deemed a ratings disaster and put on the chopping block for cancellation, returning producer Lorne Michaels offered Hooks a contract in 1986, along with new recruits Dana Carvey and Phil Hartman, among others. They helped put the show back in the national spotlight. Her characters included Candy Sweeney of "Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced 1986–1987#The Sweeney Sisters The Sweeney Sisters". She performed notable impressions of Bette Davis, Ann-Margret, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, Sinéad OConnor, Jodie Foster, Drew Barrymore, Tammy Faye Messner Tammy Faye Bakker, Kathie Lee Gifford, Kitty Dukakis, Diane Sawyer and Hillary Clinton.

Tiring of the stress of performing on a live show, Hooks left SNL in 1991 after being asked by Linda Bloodworth-Thomason to replace Jean Smart on the CBS sitcom Designing Women. Hooks played the role of Carlene Dobber for the final two seasons of the show. She continued to make occasional appearances on SNL through 1994, usually playing Hillary Clinton. According to a 2014 Grantland article about her career and death, Hooks combination of anxiety about acting and generally laidback approach to seeking out work led to her often turning down both prestigious auditions and lucrative acting roles; Tina Fey commented after her death that she was angry that Hooks didnt have a more successful career (Fey compared Hooks to Rob Schneider in noting Hooks was a bigger star than him on SNL and should have at least had his level of success) but another friend stated that Hooks didnt have doors slammed in her face and often made no efforts to seek out work. She appeared in several movies, starred as Dixie Glick in the series Jiminy Glick Primetime Glick, and the movie Jiminy Glick in Lalawood. She had a recurring role as the trashy Vicki Dubcek on 3rd Rock from the Sun, which earned Hooks an Emmy Award nomination. Hooks guest-starred on two Matt Groening-produced cartoons for the FOX Network: six episodes of The Simpsons between 1997 and 2002, as Apus wife Manjula (although Tress MacNeille sometimes substituted for her, and eventually replaced Hooks),<ref>{{Cite news url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29566428 title=US comedian Jan Hooks dies aged 57 publisher=BBC News date=October 10, 2014 accessdate=October 10, 2014}}</ref> and in Futurama (in the episode "Bendless Love" as the voice of a female robot named Angleyne).<ref name="imdb"/> She appeared in Pee-wees Big Adventure as a know-it-all tour guide at the Alamo Mission in San Antonio Alamo and made a cameo appearance in the 1992 movie Batman Returns as Jen, the Penguin (comics) Penguins image consultant during his campaign to become Mayor of Gotham City. She made two appearances on 30 Rock in 2010 playing Jenna Maroneys mother, Verna, which ultimately were the last live-action spots she ever did. She guest starred in a 2013 episode of The Cleveland Show called "Mr. and Mrs. Brown", which was her final acting job.<ref name="imdb">{{IMDb name 0393660}}</ref>
