{{Quote I dont think I would have done it as well. Its an interesting question – whether youve contributed more to the vast store of human enjoyment by doing comedy or by being a doctor, but the answer for me is that I dont think I would have been as successful or as happy being a doctor.<ref name="WINKLER-2005">

===Radio===
