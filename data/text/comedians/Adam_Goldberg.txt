==Career==

===Film===
Goldbergs first major screen role was in the Billy Crystal film Mr. Saturday Night (1992). His career-making role was arguably that of the tough, wise-cracking infantryman Mellish in Steven Spielbergs 1998 film Saving Private Ryan. While he played a lead character in The Hebrew Hammer, Goldberg has mostly been cast in supporting roles.

Notable roles include Jerry, the undead servant to Christopher Walkens Gabriel Angel Gabriel in the supernatural thriller The Prophecy. Goldberg has also worked with preeminent voice artists like Dan Castellaneta and Charlie Adler, his vocal performances in Babe: Pig in the City and cartoons like Eek! The Cat. Goldberg often portrays stereotypically Jewish characters (most notably in Dazed and Confused (film) Dazed and Confused, The Hebrew Hammer and in the TV series Entourage (U.S. TV series) Entourage).<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.matchflick.com/column/1146 title=ADAM GOLDBERG: Mixed Blessings website=Matchflick.com accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref>

Goldberg appeared extensively in the Flaming Lips documentary The Fearless Freaks, and had a supporting role in Christmas on Mars, a science fiction film written and directed by Lips frontman Wayne Coyne. In 1999, he appeared in the Sixpence None The Richer music video "There She Goes (The Las song) There She Goes".

Goldberg wrote, produced, directed and edited the features Scotch and Milk and I Love Your Work, as well as multiple television projects, notably including the philosophical travelogue Running with the Bulls for Independent Film Channel IFC.

===Music===
A guitarist and songwriter, Goldberg composed and arranged the music to the I Love Your Work and Running with the Bulls and provided a song for the Hebrew Hammer soundtrack. He is known to travel with a cheap acoustic guitar, as can be seen in Running with the Bulls. Goldberg has released rock and jazz albums, including Changes, with Latin jazz percussionist Phil Maturano.

He plays in a group named LANDy. LANDys debut album, Eros and Omissions, was released on June 23, 2009. Flaming Lips drummer Steven Drozd, with whom Goldberg collaborated on the score for I Love Your Work, performed on the record. Earlimarts Aaron Espinoza is credited as having done the final mix as well as having engineered many of the more recent songs.<ref name="WiredReview">{{cite web url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/06/gear-fetish-energizes-landys-eros-and-omissions-space-pop/  title=Gear Fetish Energizes Landys Eros and Omissions Space Pop accessdate=2011-02-28 last=Thill first=Scott date=June 25, 2009 work=Wired (website) Wired}}</ref>

On June 7, 2011, Goldberg performed as lead singer with his group The Goldberg Sisters, performing "Shush" on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.

=== Television ===
In 1995, Goldberg appeared in a signature wise-cracking role as delivery boy Leo in the television comedy Double Rush. Goldberg then appeared in a three-episode arc in the second season of Friends (1996)  as Chandler Bing Chandlers crazy roommate Eddie. He appeared some years later in a nine-episode arc in season two of the Friends spinoff show Joey (TV series) Joey as Jimmy, Joey Tribbianis best friend from high school. He also appeared as a main character in the short-lived 2005 Fox Network Fox series Head Cases.

Goldberg appeared in the short-lived ensemble cop show The Unusuals, playing a detective in New York City with brain cancer who refuses treatment because of his dislike of doctors. His character was stated as being "sarcastic" and Goldberg had been described as "one of the better reasons to watch".<ref name="NJReview">{{cite web  url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/04/the_unusuals_oneman_band_the_m.html title=NJ.com Unusuals Review accessdate=2011-02-28 last=Sepinwall first=Alan date=April 22, 2009 newspaper=The Star-Ledger}}</ref> He subsequently appeared in the short-lived ensemble cop show NYC 22.

Goldberg played the role of Dave Marks, a struggling comedian and Jim Gaffigan Jim Gaffigans best friend, for two seasons on the TV Land sitcom The Jim Gaffigan Show.

In 2017 Goldberg joined the cast of NBCs Taken (TV series) Taken as a regular cast member during the shows second season. He portrays Kilroy, an accomplished computer hacker.
