His family were regular churchgoers, belonging to the congregation of St Thomas Church. A member of the choir, from the age of 12 Secombe would perform a sketch entitled The Welsh Courtship at church socials, acting as "feed" to his sister Carol. His elder brother, Fred Secombe,<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1316865/Flowers-and-fond-farewells-for-Sir-Harry.html title=Flowers and fond farewells for Sir Harry first=By Richard last=Alleyne publisher=}}</ref> was the author of several books about his experiences as an Anglican priest and rector.

==British Army==
After leaving school in 1937, Secombe became a pay clerk at Baldwins store. With war looming, he decided in 1938 that he would join the Army Reserve (United Kingdom) Territorial Army (United Kingdom). Very myopia short sighted, he got a friend to tell him the sight test, and then learnt it by heart. He served as a Lance Bombardier in No.132 Field Regiment of the Royal Artillery.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk">{{cite web url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1315822/Sir-Harry-Secombe.html title=Sir Harry Secombe publisher=}}</ref> He would refer to the unit in which he served during World War II in the North African Campaign, Allied invasion of Sicily Sicily, and Italian Campaign (World War II) Italy, as "The Five-Mile Snipers".  While in North Africa Secombe met Spike Milligan for the first time.<ref name="entertainmentscene360.com">{{cite web url=http://www.entertainmentscene360.com/index.php/biography-harry-secombe-7369/ title=Die Besten Wimpern Tipps – Alles über Styling, Pflegeprodukte und vieles mehr publisher=}}</ref>  In Sicily he joined a concert party and developed his own comedy routines to entertain the troops.

When Secombe visited the Falkland Islands to entertain the troops after the 1982 Falklands War, his old regiment promoted him to the rank of sergeant: 37 years after he had been demobilization demobbed.<ref name="BBCWales"/>

==As an entertainer==
He made his first radio broadcast in May 1944 on a variety show aimed at the services. Following the end of fighting in the war but prior to demobilisation Secombe joined a pool of entertainers in Naples and formed a comedy duo with Spike Milligan.<ref name="entertainmentscene360.com"/>

Secombe joined the cast of the Windmill Theatre in 1946, using a routine he had developed in Italy about how people shaved.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> Secombe always claimed that his ability to sing could always be counted on to save him when he bombed. Both Milligan and Sellers credited him with keeping the act on the bill when club owners had wanted to sack them.{{Citation needed date=October 2008}}

After a regional touring career, his first break came in radio when he was chosen as resident comedian for the Welsh series Welsh Rarebit (radio programme) Welsh Rarebit, followed by appearances on Variety Bandbox and a regular role in Educating Archie.

Secombe met Michael Bentine at the Windmill Theatre, and was introduced to Peter Sellers by his agent Jimmy Grafton. Together with Spike Milligan, the four wrote a comedy radio script, and Those Crazy People was commissioned<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thegoonshow/ "Comedy The Goon Show"], BBC website</ref> and first broadcast on 28 May 1951. Produced by Peter Ross, this would soon become The Goon Show and the show remained on the air until 1960.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> Secombe mainly played Neddie Seagoon, around whom the shows absurd plots developed.<ref name="BBCWales"/> In 1955, whilst appearing on The Goon Show, Secombe was approached by the BBC to step in at short notice to take the lead in the radio comedy Hancocks Half Hour.<ref name="BBC Hancock">{{cite web url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/andrew-secombe-cast-in-missing-hancocks title=Andrew Secombe cast in his father’s role in new episodes of BBC Radio 4’s The Missing Hancocks publisher=BBC Media Centre accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> The star of the show, Tony Hancock, had decided to take an unannounced break abroad the day before the live airing of the second season. Secombe appeared in the lead for the first three episodes and had a guest role in the fourth after Hancocks return. All four episodes are lost, but following the discovery of the original scripts the episodes were rerecorded in 2017, with Andy Secombe Andrew Secombe performing the role held by his then late father.<ref name="BBC Hancock"/><ref name="BBC Radio Times">{{cite web url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-03-14/how-radio-4-is-bringing-tony-hancock-back-to-life title=How Radio 4 is bringing Tony Hancock back to life publisher=Radio Times first=Stephen last=Armstrong accessdate=29 March 2017 date=14 March 2017}}</ref>

With the success of The Goon Show, Secombe developed a dual career as both a comedy actor and a singer. At the beginning of his career as an entertainer his act would end with a joke version of the duet Sweethearts (song) Sweethearts, in which he sang both the baritone and falsetto parts. Trained under Italian maestro Manlio di Veroli, he emerged as a bel canto tenor (characteristically, he insisted that in his case this meant "can belto") and had a long list of best-selling record albums to his credit.<ref name="BBCWales">{{cite web url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/halloffame/showbiz/harrysecombe.shtml title=Sir Harry Secombe publisher=BBC Wales accessdate=2 March 2009}}</ref>

In 1958 he appeared in the film Jet Storm, which starred Sybil Thorndike Dame Sybil Thorndike and Richard Attenborough<!-- he wasnt knighted until 1976. --> and in the same year Secombe starred in the title role in Davy (film) Davy, one of Ealing Studios last films.<ref name="BBCWales"/>

The power of his voice allowed Secombe to appear in many stage Musical theater musicals. This included 1963s Pickwick (musical) Pickwick, based on Charles Dickens The Pickwick Papers, which gave him the number 18 hit single "If I Ruled the World" – his later signature tune. In 1965 the show was produced on tour in the United States, where on Broadway he garnered a nomination for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical.<ref name="BBCWales"/> He also appeared in the musical The Four Musketeers (musical) The Four Musketeers (1967) at Drury Lane,<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> as Mr. Bumble in Carol Reeds film of Oliver! (film) Oliver! (1968), and in the Envy segment of The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins (1971).

He would go on to star in his own television show, The Harry Secombe Show, which debuted on Christmas Day 1968 on BBC One BBC 1 and ran for thirty-one episodes until 1973. A sketch comedy show featuring Julian Orchard as Secombes regular sidekick, the series also featured guest appearances by fellow Goon Spike Milligan as well as leading performers such as Ronnie Barker and Arthur Lowe. Secombe later starred in similar vehicles such as Sing a Song of Secombe and ITV (TV network) ITVs Secombe with Music during the 1970s.<ref>Jack Kibble-White & Steve Williams, The Encyclopedia of Classic Saturday Night Telly, London: 2007, pp 158–9</ref>

==Later career==
Later in life, Secombe (whose brother Fred Secombe was a priest in the Church in Wales, part of the Anglican Communion) attracted new audiences as a presenter of religious programmes, such as the BBCs Songs of Praise and ITV (TV network) ITVs Stars on Sunday (TV series) Stars on Sunday and Highway (TV series) Highway. He was also a special programming consultant to ITV Wales & West Harlech Television.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news  url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,471984,00.html  title=Sir Harry Secombe dies  work=The Guardian  date=11 April 2001  accessdate=4 June 2006}}</ref> and hosted a Thames Television programme in 1979 entitled Cross on the Donkeys Back. In the latter half of the 1980s, Secombe personally sponsored a football team for boys aged 9–11 in the local West Sutton Little League, Secombes Knights.

In 1990, he was one of a few to be honoured by a second appearance on This Is Your Life (UK TV series) This Is Your Life, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at a book signing in a London branch of WH Smith. Secombe had been a subject of the show previously in March 1958 when Eamonn Andrews surprised him at the BBC Television Theatre.

==Later life and death==
Secombe suffered from peritonitis in 1980. Within two years, taking advice from doctors, he had lost five stone in weight.<ref>The Unforgettable</ref> He had a stroke in 1997, from which he made a slow recovery. He was then diagnosed with prostate cancer in September 1998. After suffering a second stroke in 1999, he was forced to abandon his television career, but made a documentary about his condition in the hope of giving encouragement to other sufferers.<ref name="TVHeaven">{{cite web  url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/hissecombe.htm  title=Television Heaven: Harry Secombe  accessdate=12 February 2006  archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051118201531/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/hissecombe.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->  archivedate = 18 November 2005}}</ref> Secombe had diabetes in the latter part of his life.

Secombe died on 11 April 2001 at the age of 79, from prostate cancer, in hospital in Guildford, Surrey.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1315879/Goon-star-Sir-Harry-Secombe-dies-aged-79.html title=Goon star Sir Harry Secombe dies aged 79 author=Thomas Penny date=12 April 2001 work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> His ashes are interred at the parish church of Shamley Green, and a later funeral memorial service to celebrate his life was held at Westminster Abbey on 26 October 2001. As well as family members and friends, the service was also attended by Charles, Prince of Wales and representatives of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Anne, Princess Royal, Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon and Prince Edward, Duke of Kent. On his tombstone is the inscription: "To know him was to love him."

Upon hearing of his old friends death, Spike Milligan quipped, "Im glad he died before me, because I didnt want him to sing at my funeral." But Secombe would have the last laugh: upon Milligans own death the following year, a recording of Secombe singing was played at Spikes memorial service.

The Secombe Theatre at Sutton, London, bears his name in memory of this former local personality. He is also fondly remembered at the London Welsh Centre, where he opened the bar on St Patricks Day (17 March) 1971.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.londonwelsh.org/about-us/history-of-the-centre  title=History: London Welsh Centre  publisher=London Welsh Centre  year=2009 accessdate=4 February 2011 work=London Welsh Centre website}}</ref>
