Black recounts in his book Nothings Sacred that he scored highly on the math section of his SAT exam and later applied to Yale, Princeton University Princeton, Brown University Brown, Amherst College Amherst, Williams College Williams, and Georgetown University Georgetown. Every college he applied to except Georgetown rejected him, and by that point he had decided he did not want to go there, so he spent a year at University of Maryland before transferring to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There, he studied playwriting and was a brother of Pi Lambda Phi International Fraternities and sororities fraternity and a member of Student Congress.<ref>{{cite news title=Arts – Back in Black first=Nick  last=Parker  date=February 7, 2002  newspaper=Daily Tar Heel location=University of North Carolina  url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2002/02/07/3c6289dbc0b6c?in_archive=1  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030220174555/http://www.dailytarheel.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2002/02/07/3c6289dbc0b6c?in_archive=1  archivedate=2003-02-20}}</ref> After graduating in 1970, he returned to Washington, where he worked at the Appalachian Regional Commission, wrote plays, and performed stand-up comedy at the Brickskeller in Dupont Circle.<ref name= rage/>

He earned an Master of Fine Arts MFA degree at the Yale School of Drama in 1977, and was married for ten months when he was 26 years old.<ref name= rage/><ref name="Nothings Sacred">{{cite book last=Black first=Lewis title=Nothings Sacred year=2005 publisher=Simon Spotlight Entertainment isbn=0-689-87647-5 page=201}}</ref>

Blacks career began in theater as a playwright. He served as the playwright-in-residence and associate artistic director of Steve Olsens West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar in Hells Kitchen, Manhattan Hells Kitchen in New York City, where he collaborated with composer and lyricist Rusty Magee and artistic director Rand Foerster on hundreds of one-act plays from 1981 to 1989. Also with Rusty Magee, Black wrote the musical The Czar of Rock and Roll, which premiered at Houstons Alley Theatre in 1990. Blacks stand-up comedy began as an opening act for the plays; he was also the Master of Ceremonies master of ceremonies. After a management change at the theater, Black left and began working as a comedian, as well as finding bit parts in television and films.

==Comedic style==
Blacks style of comedy is that of a man who, in dealing with the absurdities of life and contemporary politics, is approaching his personal limits of sanity.  His techniques include sarcasm, hyperbole, profanity, shouting and his trademark angry finger-shaking, which bring emphasis to his topics of discussion. He once described his humor as "being on the Titanic every single day and being the only person who knows what is going to happen."<ref>{{cite web  title= Lewis Black Is Not An Asshole  first= Johnny  last= Firecloud  date= August 22, 2008  work= Antiquiet  url= http://www.antiquiet.com/interviews/2008/08/lewis-black-is-not-an-asshole/ }}</ref>

Black has described his political affiliation as:
"Im a Socialism socialist, so that puts me totally outside any concept...the Canadians get it. But seriously, most people dont get it. The idea of Taxation in the United States capping peoples income just scares people. Oh, youre taking money from Upper class the rich. Ooh, what a horrifying thing. These people really need $200 million".<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.gotorenotahoe.com/news/stories/html/2006/06/29/2432.php  title=Lewis Black’s back to comment on what ails society  date= May 18, 2006  work=(GotoRenoTahoe)  publisher=Reno Gazette-Journal  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706162616/http://www.gotorenotahoe.com/news/stories/html/2006/06/29/2432.php archivedate=2006-07-06 }}</ref>

==Career==

===Stand-up comedy===
In 1998, Black starred in his first comedy special on the series Comedy Central Presents. He starred in two additional episodes of the series in 2000 and 2002. He starred in another special for the network in 2002, titled Taxed Beyond Belief.

From 2003 to 2005, Black hosted the "World Stupidity Awards" ceremony at Montreals Just for Laughs comedy festival.

In 2004, he had an HBO stand-up special titled Black on Broadway. Black hosted Comedy Centrals Last Laugh 07, which aired on December 2, 2007 along with Dave Attell and D.L. Hughley.

In 2006, Black performed at the Warner Theatre (Washington, D.C.) Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C. for an HBO special, Red, White, and Screwed. It aired in June and a DVD was released in October. When explaining his choice of venue, Black said that "some asshole" was paid to count the number of times the word "fuck" was said in his previous HBO special, Black On Broadway, and that the original location, the Kennedy Center, wanted him to cut back on its use. Black was told the number was 42, when actually it was approximately 78.{{Citation needed date=March 2009}}

Black received a 2007 Grammy award for "Best Comedy Album" for his album The Carnegie Hall Performance.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.grammy.com/Grammy_Awards/49th_show/list.aspx#20  title=Grammy Awards  publisher=Grammy.com  date=September 30, 2006  accessdate=2010-11-01  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061220160454/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx  archivedate=December 20, 2006  df= }}</ref>

Black hosted the Comedy Central television series The Root of All Evil (TV show) The Root of All Evil in 2008. The show pitted two people or pop-culture topics against each other as a panel of comedians argued, in the style of a court trial, which is more evil, e.g., "Paris Hilton vs. Dick Cheney" and "Internet Porn vs. YouTube". After hearing arguments from both sides, Black, acting as judge, made the final decision as to which is more evil.<ref>[http://tv.ign.com/articles/825/825095p1.html "Comedy Central Gets Angry With Lewis Black"].

===Tours===
On June 18, 2007, he sat in with Southern rock/Jam band Govt Mule at the 6th annual Bonnaroo music festival, where he had performed earlier that weekend, for what was to be a quick joke. A member of the audience threw a bottle at Black, which bottling (concert abuse) struck him.

This act was seen in an episode of Lewis Blacks Root of All Evil titled "YouTube vs. Pornography Porn".

On June 29, 2007, Black gave a benefit show at Springbrook High School, his alma mater, in the schools auditorium for 1,100 alumni, faculty, and students.

==The Naked Teen Voyeur Bus==
File:Black, Lewis (USGov).jpg thumb Lewis Black at "Stand Up for Heroes"
In 2000, Black and fellow comedian Jim Norton (American comedian) Jim Norton were arrested for their involvement with "The Naked Teen Voyeur Bus",<ref>Trunk, Russell A. [http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=587 "Lewis Black: The Carnegie Hall Performance"] (Anne Carlini) website.</ref> a specially designed bus with acrylic glass walls containing numerous 18- and 19-year-old topless women.
