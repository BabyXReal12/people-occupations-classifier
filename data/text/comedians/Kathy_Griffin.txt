==Early life==
Kathleen Mary Griffin was born on November 4, 1960, in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois,
to Mary Margaret "Maggie" Griffin (née Corbally) and John Patrick Griffin, both first-generation Irish-Americans.
Maggie Griffin worked as a cashier for Oak Park Hospital. Griffin has four older siblings: Kenny, Joyce (died 2017), Gary (died 2014), and John. Griffin described herself during her early years as "a kid who needed to talk, all the time".
Her brother Gary and her sister Joyce both died from cancer.
She would often visit her neighbors, the Bowens, to tell them stories about her family; she has referred to those visits as her first live shows and the place where she learned "the power of juicy material".
After most of her siblings had moved, Griffin often spent hours alone in the house and developed a binge eating disorder. She explained that even though eating disorders were not very well known at that time, she knew her eating behavior was aberrant and always threw the garbage away in the neighbors can.
In her 2009 autobiography Official Book Club Selection, Griffin confessed that she "still suffers [from food issues]" but has learned to "deal with them".
In the same book, Griffin discussed her eldest brother, Kenny, who was a drug addict and homeless at various times, and revealed that she was "afraid of him until the moment he died" due to his violent, abusive nature. Griffin states that Kenny would climb into bed with her when he was 30 and she was 7 and "whisper" into her ears; Kathy refused to speak to him or be in the same room as him for years but did not tell her parents until she was in her twenties, at which point he openly admitted pedophilia to their parents.
As a young girl, Griffin attended St. Bernadines Elementary School and began to develop a dislike for organized religion because of the punishments she and other "vulnerable" students received from the nuns.
After graduation, she attended Oak Park and River Forest High School and sought refuge in musical theatre, playing roles such as Rosemary in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying and Hodel in Fiddler on the Roof.
During her senior year she began arguing with her parents, who wanted her to attend college, because she wanted to become a professional actress. Her first appearance on television was as an extra on a Chicago White Sox commercial, and she was signed with several Chicago talent agencies. At 18, Griffin persuaded her parents to move to Los Angeles to help her become famous.
At 19, Griffin attended a show of the California-based improvisational group The Groundlings. She said, "I thought this is where I want to be. This is the greatest thing in the world."

Griffin began performing in the early 1980s in the Los Angeles Improvisational theatre#Improvisational comedy improv comedy troupe The Groundlings.
In an E! True Hollywood Story segment, she stated that she often went to see the Groundlings perform before she joined. She said that, at one show, she went backstage and talked with Groundling member Phil Hartman and asked him what the group was all about. This led to her taking classes there and eventually being asked into the Groundlings main company. While Kathy was a Groundling, she became best friends with Judy Toll.{{citation needed date=January 2018}}

Although Griffin was rumored to be banned from future CNN broadcasts,
she co-hosted the show with Cooper until 2017.

She also remarks that the performance of "Loser Like Me" by the shows primary Glee club, New Directions, was disgraceful because "when I lost the election, I didnt sing about being a loser, I twittered that Barack Obama Obama is a terrorist"; this remark almost started an argument between her and fellow judge Sister Mary Constance (Loretta Devine).{{citation needed date=January 2018}}

On January 7, 2012, it was announced that—along with having two more standup specials on Bravo—Griffin will start a weekly one-hour talk show on the channel, Kathy (TV series) Kathy, which will consist of standup routines, "rant about pop culture", and celebrity interviews.

===Laugh Your Head Off World Tour 2017–2018===
In August 2017, Griffin announced a worldwide comedy tour. The title "Laugh Your Head Off" was a reference to her depiction of an effigy of U.S. President Donald Trumps severed head. The tour visited major cities in Singapore, Australia, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and many more European, and Asian cities. Several shows sold out within minutes of going on sale, leading to Griffin adding several shows to the lineup.
She continued with a North America leg of the tour, commencing May 23, 2018, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and including both Radio City Music Hall and Carnegie Hall in New York City.
==Controversies==
===Various talk shows bans===
Although some talk show hosts such as Craig Kilborn, Bill Maher and Howard Stern (whom she credits with giving her a "straight fanbase") welcome her humor on their programs, Griffin said she was banned from appearing on several TV shows including The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and The View (U.S. TV series) The View.
She got re-banned from The View because of a joke she made about Barbara Walters. She says Ellen{{}}s producers told her they cannot have her on "trashing celebrities",
but she appeared as a guest on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on September 11, 2007.
One of the most notable controversies occurred when she made a joke during a 2005 E! televised event that the child actress Dakota Fanning, then age 11, had entered drug rehabilitation.
This incident got Griffin fired from hosting duties on E!s red-carpet award show coverage. Nevertheless, E! purchased rights to air My Life on the D-List for its British channel, a fact she noted in an episode of season 3.{{citation needed date=January 2018}}

===Emmy Awards controversy===

The second season of My Life on the D-List, which premiered on June 6, 2006, earned Griffin the 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program Outstanding Reality Program, non-competition, on September 8, 2007. She received it during the Creative Arts Emmy Awards, which was hosted by Carlos Mencia and aired on E! on September 15. Griffin stirred up controversy with her acceptance speech, saying,

{{quote Now, a lot of people come up here and thank Jesus for this award. I want you to know that no one had less to do with this award than Jesus. He didnt help me a bit. If it was up to him, Cesar Millan would be up here with that damn dog. So all I can say is suck it, Jesus, this award is my God now!
}}

Griffin later explained that she meant this remark not as a slight on Jesus, but rather as a satire of celebrities who thank Jesus profusely and nonsensically for their awards, especially artists who themselves are controversial in their speech and actions.
The Catholic League (U.S.) Catholic League urged the academy to "denounce Griffins obscene and blasphemy blasphemous comment."
Smoky Mountain Opry Theater The Miracle Theater of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee printed out a full-page advertisement for USA Today which said, "Although others may choose to use their national platform to slander our God, we are honored as professional entertainers to stand for Christ."
The Academy said that her "offensive remarks will not be part of the E! telecast on Saturday night".
Griffin later responded, "Am I the only Catholic left with a sense of humor?"
====Termination of appearance on Hannah Montana====
Griffin said she was fired from an appearance on the show Hannah Montana, on account of her Emmy acceptance speech. According to Griffin "the instructions literally came down, We dont want her anywhere near the building."
Griffin responded in her comedy act, joking that Miley Cyrus "...has been flashing her green bra and posing topless."
=== Banning from Apollo Theater ===
In a July 2009 episode of My Life on the D-List, after using profanity in an Natalie Suleman Octomom joke during her routine at New Yorks Apollo Theater, Griffin said that she received a letter banning her from the venue.
===Depiction of President Trump===
On May 30, 2017, Griffin posted a video of herself holding "a mask styled to look like the severed, bloody head" of President of the United States U.S. President Donald Trump,
which was posted on her Instagram and Twitter accounts. She wrote: "I caption this there was blood coming out of his eyes, blood coming out of his...wherever," referencing a past comment Trump had made about Megyn Kelly. The video was from a shoot with photographer Tyler Shields, who is known for producing "shocking" imagery.
Various members of the Trump family responded to the photo, including Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr. Donald Jr., and his wife Melania Trump Melania, who said, "As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing. When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it."
Griffin later took down the image, and apologized publicly for the photo, saying she went too far and adding, "I beg for your forgiveness."
On June 2, 2017, an attorney for Griffin, Lisa Bloom, stated, "Like many edgy works of artistic expression, the photo could be interpreted different ways. But Griffin never imagined that it could be misinterpreted as a threat of violence against Trump. That was never what she intended. She has never threatened or committed an act of violence against anyone."
Griffin claimed the Trump family was "trying to ruin my life forever".
In August 2017, Griffin retracted her apology during an interview on Australian TV
and again on Skavlan in November 2017.
====Backlash====
In May 2017, Griffin subsequently was dropped by Squatty Potty as a marketing spokesperson.
On May 31, 2017, CNN fired her from its New Years Eve Live (CNN program) New Years Eve broadcast with Anderson Cooper.
CNN said in a statement prior to announcing her termination, "We found what she did disgusting and offensive. We are pleased to see she has apologized and asked that the photos be taken down."
Cooper said, "For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate."
All of her remaining scheduled tour dates were canceled by their respective venues,
and then United States Senate U.S. Senator Al Franken from Minnesota disinvited Griffin from a promotional event for his upcoming book.
U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto from Nevada announced she is going to donate the $1,000 received from Griffin to charity.
On October 28, 2017, Griffin uploaded a YouTube video titled "Kathy Griffin: A Hell of a Story", detailing the backlash she received for the Trump photo controversy.
She claimed she was under a federal investigation by the United States Department of Justice Justice Department for two months and on the No Fly List during that time. She also said she was put on the Interpol list, the Five Eyes list, and had been detained at every airport during her Laugh Your Head Off World Tour.
==Style of humor==
Griffin developed her love for popular culture through her immediate and extended family, who were frequently commenting about the latest news. She explained that "I may have been into The Brady Bunch like every other kid, but I also wanted to watch John Lennon and Yoko Ono on The Dick Cavett Show, and every minute of the United States Senate Watergate Committee Watergate hearings. It was
fear of the dinner table that got me hooked."
She has also named her mother Maggie as influential in her consumption of pop culture, calling her "the ideal audience for the Hollywood dish". Griffin named the character of Rhoda Morgenstern of 1970s sitcom The Mary Tyler Moore Show as an influence, saying,
{{quote [The Mary Tyler Moore Show] gave me the first inkling of what place I could have in the entertainment world. [...] But when Rhoda burst through the door in her Gypsy headscarf, billowy caftan, and hilariously abrasive delivery, I was like, Who is that? Oh my God! Thats when I fell in love with wanting to be the sidekick. Everything out of her mouth was hysterical, yet she was vulnerable and human. I remember my family fell in love with her, too. Thats who I wanted to be. She had all the jokes.

While Griffin established her career with candid observations about everyday life and her dating experiences, later focusing on mainly mocking celebrities, her act currently consists of recounting embellished stories involving celebrities. Though her humor may be wicked, Griffin hopes people understand that no malice is intended by it. "Im genuinely a fan of most of the people I trash in the act," said Griffin in an interview. "I really, really try and focus on making fun of people for their behavior. Im not so into making fun of someone for the way they look, or something thats out of their control."
Griffin is sometimes the object of her own humor, particularly with regard to her D-list status. While Griffin paints herself as a Hollywood outsider, she has a group of close celebrity friends such as Rosie ODonnell, Joan Rivers, Jerry Seinfeld, Gloria Estefan, Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Coolidge, Rachel True, Larry David, Ricky Gervais, Anderson Cooper, Cher and Lance Bass. Her longtime friendship with Bass was the catalyst for a feud between her and gossip blogger Perez Hilton, in which Griffin expressed anger over Hiltons "outing" of Bass on his website, calling Hiltons attacks on Bass "mean" and "unfunny".
Hilton responded by saying that Griffins anger was hypocritical, considering all of the gay jokes she makes about Clay Aiken in her stand-up routines.
In 2007, Griffin commented on her aversion to making fun of celebrity friends by saying, "Theres nothing I wont do, but on the other hand Im full of shit because that changes. For example, you know Lance Bass from NSYNC N Sync and how hes gay now? All those years that I knew he was gay, he and I were friends, I would never say, Hey, by the way, did you know that Lance Bass is gay?"
Griffin and Hilton ended their feud after the death of Griffins father, and Hilton appeared on an episode of her show in 2007.
In July 2008, Hilton asserted that Griffins assistant Jessica Zajicek had quit because she could not take Griffins now hectic career. Griffin dismissed these statements as false as Zajicek is still working for Griffin.
However, the season premiere of The D-List depicted that Zajicek was no longer working for Griffin; Griffin explained early in the episode that Zajicek "has decided to move on".

Griffin caused controversy when she confronted Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann over her views on homosexuality at the 2010 Radio and Television Correspondents Association Dinner, while in town for her rally against DADT. According to Griffin, she asked Bachmann "were you born a bigot or did you grow into it", a reference to Bachmanns belief that homosexuality is strictly environmental.
Griffin said Bachmann replied by saying, "Thats a good question, Ill have to think about that." Bachmanns office confirmed the exchange but said Griffin confronted Bachmann after Bachmann approached Griffin to compliment her appearance.
Griffin has been a long-time supporter of the Aid for AIDS annual fundraiser, Best in Drag Show in Los Angeles, and hosted the opening of the show for more than five years.
