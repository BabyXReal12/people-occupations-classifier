Lewis claims to be the originator of the phrase "The ______ from hell" as in "the night from hell", "the date from hell" or "the roommate from hell". This theory is expounded in the Curb Your Enthusiasm episode "The Nanny from Hell". Lewis has petitioned the editors of Bartletts Familiar Quotations Bartletts to be given credit for the coinage, but the editors claim that the phrase was a common idiom prior to Lewiss use of it.<ref>{{cite news  last= Flamm  first= Matthew   url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,384097,00.html   archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090718060749/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,384097,00.html   title= Between the Lines   work= Entertainment Weekly   date= November 1, 2002   accessdate= December 28, 2006}}</ref> (For example, during World War I, kilted Scottish soldiers were given the nickname Black Watch "The Ladies from Hell" (translation of German "Die Damen aus der Hölle") by German troops. A short story, “The Man from Hell”, by John Russell Fearn was published in Fantastic Adventures in 1939.) However, the Yale Book of Quotations attributes the phrase to Lewis.<ref> [http://yalepress.typepad.com/yalepresslog/2006/10/yale_gives_rich.html Yale Press Log: Yale Gives Richard Lewis Hell] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603034014/http://yalepress.typepad.com/yalepresslog/2006/10/yale_gives_rich.html  date=2008-06-03 }}, 2006-10-11.
