===The Simpsons (1989–present)===
Azaria became famous for his Voice acting voice work in the ongoing animated television series The Simpsons. He joined the show having previously performed only one voice-over—as the titular animated dog in the failed Fox Broadcasting Company Fox pilot Hollywood Dog, a show he described as "sort of Who Framed Roger Rabbit Roger Rabbit-esque, where the dog was animated, but everybody else was real."<ref name=msn/> The first voice he performed on The Simpsons was that of town bartender Moe Szyslak, replacing Christopher Collins who had initially recorded the characters voice. Having known him from Hollywood Dog, casting director Bonita Pietila called Azaria and asked him to audition for the voice of Moe.<ref name=msn/> At the time he was performing the role of a drug dealer in a play, utilizing a voice based on actor Al Pacinos performance in the film Dog Day Afternoon. He used the voice in his audition for The Simpsons and, at the request of the shows executive producers Matt Groening and Sam Simon, made the voice more "gravelly". Groening and Simon thought the resultant voice was ideal for Moe and took Azaria over to the Fox recording studio. Before he had even seen a script, he recorded several lines of dialogue as Moe for the episode "Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons) Some Enchanted Evening", Dubbing (filmmaking) dubbing Collins voice.<ref name=freshair>{{cite interview  last=Azaria  first=Hank  interviewer=Terry Gross  title=Fresh Air  work=National Public Radio  publisher=WHYY-FM  url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4679119  location=Philadelphia  date=2004-12-06  accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref><ref name=avclub/><ref name=barber/><ref>{{cite video  people=Silverman, David  date=2001  title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Some Enchanted Evening"  medium=DVD  publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

Azaria did not expect to hear from the show again, but they continued to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.<ref name="freshair" /> He felt that, initially, "[the producers] didnt seem too pleased with what I had done...[Simon] was very exacting...[and] was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I thought it was going to be my last week because I really didnt think I had done that well."<ref name="avclub" /> Nevertheless, by the shows The Simpsons (season 2) second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast.<ref name="freshair" /> Since he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the "new guy".<ref>{{cite video  people=Groening, Matt  date=2001  title=The Simpsons The Complete First Season DVD commentary for the episode "Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons) Some Enchanted Evening"  medium=DVD  publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Lenny and Carl#Carl Carlson Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Lou Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Sea Captain the Sea Captain, List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Superintendent Chalmers Superintendent Chalmers, List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Disco Stu Disco Stu, List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Duffman Duffman, List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Wiseguy the Wiseguy and numerous one-time characters.<ref>{{cite book  last1=McCann  first1=Jesse L.  last2=Groening  first2=Matt  title=The Simpsons Beyond Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family ...Still Continued  year=2002  publisher=Harper Collins Publishers  isbn=0-06-050592-3  pages=116 }}</ref> His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: "The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated.

As Moes voice is based on Al Pacinos, likewise many of Azarias other recurring characters are based on existing sources. He took Apus voice from the many Indian and Pakistani convenience store workers in Los Angeles that he had interacted with when he first moved to the area, and also loosely based it on Peter Sellers character Hrundi V. Bakshi from the film The Party (1968 film) The Party.<ref name="freshair" /> Originally, it was thought that Apu being Indian was too offensive and stereotyped, but after Azarias reading of the line "Hello, Mr. Homer", which the shows producers thought was hilarious, the character stayed.<ref name="msn" /><ref name="tvguide">{{cite news  title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves  date=2000-10-21  work=TV Guide  first=Joe  last=Rhodes}}</ref> Azaria, however, disputed this on LateNet with Ray Ellin, claiming that Apu was always intended to be stereotypical.<ref name="ellin">{{cite interview subject=Hank Azaria  interviewer=Ray Ellin  title=Hank Azaria on LateNet with Ray Ellin  url=http://www.dailycomedy.com/joke/10559  work=LateNet with Ray Ellin  publisher=Daily Comedy  date=2007-12-05  accessdate=2008-04-03  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409175439/http://www.dailycomedy.com/joke/10559  archivedate=2008-04-09  df= }}</ref> Chief Wiggums voice was originally a parody of David Brinkley, but when Azaria was told it was too slow, he switched it to that of Edward G.

Up until 1998, Azaria was paid $30,000 per episode. Azaria and the five other main The Simpsons voice actors were then involved in a pay dispute in which Fox threatened to replace them with new actors and went as far as preparing for the casting of new voices. However, the issue was soon resolved and from 1998 to 2004, they received $125,000 per episode.

====Film work====
{{Quote box
 quote="[Azarias] appeal can best be summed up by, of all things, his hilarious cameo in the goofy comedy Dodgeball. As Patches OHoulihan, the dodgeball champion who will age into the magnificently gruff Rip Torn, he delivers a pitch-perfect performance in an instructional video in which he chain-smokes, encourages a child to pick on those weaker than him, and steals the film from a cast of comedic greats. Its a wonderful, odd moment that could have failed miserably in the hands of a lesser actor, and he manages to pull it off with only seconds of dialogue. In my humble opinion, and using my limited knowledge of boxing terms: Pound for pound, Hank Azaria is the best actor working today."

Azaria made his film debut in the direct-to-video release Cool Blue (1990), as Buzz.<ref name=avclub/> His first theatrically released feature film appearance came the same year in Pretty Woman, as a police detective.<ref name=awards/> His next major film role was as television producer Albert Freedman in the 1994 film Quiz Show (1994 film) Quiz Show, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.<ref name="parents"/> In 1996, Azaria played gay Guatemalan housekeeper Agador Spartacus in the film The Birdcage. For the role, which Azaria considers to be his "big break",<ref name=avclub/> he was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role,<ref name=awards/> and critically branded "the most hilarious performance in the film," by Alison Macor of The Austin Chronicle,<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3a138262  title=The Birdcage  accessdate=2007-12-31  first=Alison  last=Macor  date=1996-03-08  work=The Austin Chronicle}}</ref> while Empire (magazine) Empire wrote that he "[stole] the show."<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/remakes/default.asp?film=42  title=Remakes That Worked: The Birdcage  work=Empire (magazine) Empire  date=2010-07-16  accessdate=2011-04-16}}</ref> For the role he used a Guatemalan accent, and made himself sound as effeminate as possible. He had chosen two possible voices, an effeminate one and a tougher one. After advice from a drag queen, he chose the effeminate voice. Three weeks into production, he realized he sounded exactly like his grandmother, which aided his performance.<ref name=freshair/> Agador was originally going to be a single scene part, with the larger role of the housekeeper being played by David Alan Grier. With the producers fearing the racial connotations of a black actor in such a part, Azaria inherited the full role.<ref name=avclub/>

He appeared in numerous other films in the late 1990s, including Heat (1995 film) Heat (1995), Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), Celebrity (film) Celebrity (1998) and worked opposite Gwyneth Paltrow, as Walter Plane, in the 1998 adaptation of Great Expectations (1998 film) Great Expectations.<ref name="parents"/> He played photographer Victor "Animal" Palotti in Godzilla (1998 film) Godzilla (1998).<ref name=msn/><ref name=awards/> Godzilla was one of Azarias first starring roles in a blockbuster (entertainment) blockbuster film. Its five-month shoot was the longest of his career to date, but he considered it a good chance to boost his profile. He noted, "Im so used to melding into every character I play. Even people in the business think the guy who did Birdcage, Quiz Show and Great Expectations are three different actors—which in a way makes me proud, but in another way is very frustrating. Its the curse and blessing of the character actor".<ref name=godzilla/> The shoots physical challenges, and the films critical failure, led Azaria to later describe it as "tough to make, and very disappointing when it came out. It was one you definitely chalk up and say, That was part of paying your dues, better luck next time."<ref name=avclub/> In 1999, he starred in the drama Mystery, Alaska as Charles Danner, and the comedy superhero film Mystery Men, as the faux-British silverware throwing expert The Blue Raja.<ref name=avclub/><ref name=simp/> Other film roles included Hector Gorgonzolas in Americas Sweethearts (2001), Claude in Along Came Polly (2004), and the young Patches OHoulihan in DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story (2004), the latter two with Ben Stiller.<ref name=avclub/><ref name=awards/> For his role of Claude, a French scuba instructor, in Along Came Polly, Azaria donned a wig and worked out extensively to get into the physical shape the part required.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://movies.about.com/cs/alongcamepolly/a/pollyha011004.htm  title=Interview with Along Came Polly Co-Stars, Hank Azaria and Debra Messing  accessdate=2007-08-16  first=Rebecca  last=Murray  work=About.com}}</ref>

And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, OK, now its time to get a dramatic role."<ref name=msn/> His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising (2001 film) Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolts leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the films producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. "I know [Avnet] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in [Uprising], and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I dont understand why."<ref name=msn/> His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python.<ref name=msn/> Azaria found Uprising to be "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" material.<ref name=faces/> In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly (editor) Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass (film) Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him."<ref>{{cite news  url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/A/Azaria_Hank/2004/01/19/756458.html  title=Hank Azaria buffs up for Polly  accessdate=2011-09-11  author=Hobson, Louis B.  date=2004-01-19  publisher=Canadian Online Explorer Canoe.ca  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716204329/http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/A/Azaria_Hank/2004/01/19/756458.html  archivedate=2012-07-16  df= }}</ref>

Azaria starred in and co-wrote the third episode of the Funny or Die web-series Gamechangers, entitled "A Legend in the Booth". He played Jim Brockmire, a legendary baseball announcer, fired for a profanity-filled breakdown live on air after discovering his wife was having an affair. Azaria based the voice and style of Brockmire on several veteran sportscasters, including Bob Murphy (announcer) Bob Murphy and Phil Rizzuto.<ref>{{cite interview  last=Azaria  first=Hank  interviewer=Dan Patrick  title=Hank Azaria talks about the legend of Jim Brockmire  work=The Dan Patrick Show  url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/danpatrick/blog/109541/index.html  location=Milford, Connecticut  date=2010-05-06  accessdate=2012-09-06}}</ref> He has since appeared as Brockmire on the NFL Networks Rich Eisen The Rich Eisen Podcast to discuss the National Football League.<ref>{{cite web  last=Eisen  first=Rich  url=http://richeisen.nfl.com/2012/09/05/rich-eisen-podcast-michael-lombardi-afc-south-preview-and-jim-brockmire/  title=Rich Eisen Podcast: Michael Lombardi AFC South preview and Jim Brockmire  date=2012-09-05  accessdate=2012-09-06  publisher=NFL.com  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912045456/http://richeisen.nfl.com/2012/09/05/rich-eisen-podcast-michael-lombardi-afc-south-preview-and-jim-brockmire/  archivedate=2012-09-12  df= }}</ref> In November 2012, Azaria sued actor Craig Bierko over the ownership of the Brockmire voice.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://news-briefs.ew.com/2012/11/16/hank-azaria-sues-over-a-character-voice/  title=Hank Azaria sues over a character voice  author=Strecker, Erin  date=2012-11-16  accessdate=2012-11-17  work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> The case was ruled in Azarias favour in 2014. Both actors had been using a baseball announcer voice before and since meeting at a party in 1990, but US district judge Gary Allen Feess ruled that only Azarias voice was, as Brockmire, a defined, "tangible" character and thus subject to copyright.<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/hank-azaria-wins-lawsuit-funny-682759 title=Hank Azaria Wins Lawsuit Over Funny Baseball Announcer Character work=The Hollywood Reporter date=2014-01-24 accessdate=2014-02-24 author=Gardner, Eriq}}</ref>

==Acting style and vocal range==
Azarias friends refer to him as "the freakish mimic" due to his ability to copy almost anyones voice, instantly after he has heard it. As a child he believed that everyone could do this, but later realized that it was not a common talent.<ref name=freshair/> Azaria can "remember every voice I hear, famous or otherwise&nbsp;... they kind of remain in the memory banks, so Im ready to trot them out."<ref name=avclub/> Azaria was glad to have found the "ultimate outlet" for this skill, in The Simpsons.<ref name=freshair/> He "didnt realize it [when he joined the show], but it became like a lab for a character actor. I had to do so many voices."<ref name=msn/> In the early 2000s, Azaria felt he had reached the maximum number of voices he was capable of: "For the first 10 years of The Simpsons, I would develop a bunch of voices. And then&nbsp;... I hit a point when I was tapped out. Every noise I can make, I have made. Even characters like Gargamel, Ive done. Even if it was only two or three lines, at some point Ive done something similar on The Simpsons, at least somewhere along the line."<ref name=mw/><ref name=metro11>{{cite news  url=http://www.metro.us/newyork/entertainment/article/852199--still-trying-to-catch-those-pesky-smurfin-smurfs  title=Still trying to catch those pesky, smurfin Smurfs  work=Metro  publisher=Metro International  location=New York  author=Patalano, Heidi  date=2011-05-05  accessdate=2011-07-05  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724083251/http://www.metro.us/newyork/entertainment/article/852199--still-trying-to-catch-those-pesky-smurfin-smurfs  archivedate=2011-07-24  df= }}</ref>

For many of Azarias characters, much of their humor is derived from a "funny voice", such as The Birdcage and Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian. He stated that "being funny with a funny voice is more my comfort zone, a broader character that I try to humanize, a kind of silly or wacky persona that I try to fill in," although he finds it "much easier to be someone much closer to myself", as it requires "less energy&nbsp;... than playing characters that are so out there and high strung".<ref name=sunday/>

The Simpsons creator Matt Groening has stated that Azaria possesses the ability to turn unfunny lines into some of the best in an episode,<ref name=barber/> while former writer Jay Kogen stated: "Just when I think I know [Azarias] bag of tricks, hes always got a new thing he does to surprise me."<ref name=msn/> Throughout the run of The Simpsons, Azaria has had to sing in character several times, a task which he describes as easier than singing normally.<ref name=freshair/> The Smurfs writer David N. Weiss says Azaria "has a beautiful treasure trove of talent", and "became what you wished you were writing".<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.jpost.com/ArtsAndCulture/Entertainment/Article.aspx?id=227748  title=Blue and white all over  author=Brown, Hannah  work=The Jerusalem Post  date=2011-07-04  accessdate=2011-07-05}}</ref> Playwright Jenelle Riley wrote in 2005 that Azaria was "by far" her favorite actor, praising his "versatility" and "tendency to take small roles that would normally fade into the background and to consistently create characters people care about", noting his roles in Shattered Glass, Mystery, Alaska and especially DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story.<ref name=msn />
