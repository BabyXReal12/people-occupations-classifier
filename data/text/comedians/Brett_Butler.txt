==Career==
One of the first notable appearances for Butler was on Dolly Partons ill-fated 1987 variety series, Dolly (TV series) Dolly. Parton hired Butler as a writer for the remainder of the shows season, but the series was subsequently cancelled after one season of lackluster ratings.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/turkeys-50-remarkable-pop-culture-flops/750377_dolly-198788 title=Turkeys! 50 Remarkable Pop-Culture Flops publisher=EW.com}}</ref>

She was the star of the American Broadcasting Company ABC television show Grace Under Fire from 1993 to 1998. During the show, she battled a recurring drug addiction and spent time in rehab.<ref>{{cite web last=Flint  first=Joe  url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,289333,00.html  title=Sad Fall From Grace  publisher=EW.com  date=1997-09-12  accessdate=2013-09-04}}</ref>

Butler published her memoirs, titled Knee Deep in Paradise, in 1996. The book was started before attaining her celebrity status, and candidly addresses much of this time frame, ending the autobiography before Grace Under Fires television debut.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7868-6136-1 title=Knee Deep in Paradise  work=www.publishersweekly.com year=2003 accessdate=2015-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web author= Lisa Schwarzbaum url=http://www.ew.com/article/1996/04/19/knee-deep-paradise title=Knee Deep in Paradise  work=ew.com year=1996 accessdate=2015-11-06}}</ref>

In February 1998, due to her erratic behavior stemming from substance abuse, she was dismissed from the show and ABC canceled the series.<ref>{{cite web author=Miller, D.

After Grace was cancelled in 1998, Butler moved out of Los Angeles and onto a farm in Georgia (U.S. state) Georgia where she lived with 15 pets. In 2008, Butler headlined at an arts fundraiser and spoke freely with a reporter about her depression, past drug addiction, television work, and current life on a farm. She also expressed interest in writing another book.<ref name=santafe>[http://www.santafe.com/article/spitfire/ "Spitfire: Comic Brett Butler set to take the stage in Santa Fe"] Santafe.com October 23, 2008</ref>
