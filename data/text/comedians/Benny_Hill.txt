Alfred Hawthorne "Benny" Hill (21 January 1924<!--He was born on 21 January 1924. ref birth indexes for 1st quarter (Jan, Feb, Mar) 1924 reveal "Alfred H. Hill" registered Southampton - mothers maiden name "Cave".

Hill was a prominent figure in British culture for nearly four decades, and his show proved to be one of the great success stories of television comedy and was among the most-watched programmes in the UK; the audience peaked at more than 21 million in 1971.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1970s.html  title=Features &#124; Britains Most Watched TV &#124; 1970s  publisher=British Film Institute (BFI)  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122221511/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1970s.html  archive-date=22 November 2005  accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref>

Inspired by the "star comedians" of British music hall shows, Hill set out to make his mark in show business. He changed his name to "Benny" in homage to his favourite comedian, Jack Benny.<ref name=sabotimes/>

==Career==
After the Second World War, Hill worked as a performer on radio. His first appearance on television was in 1950. In addition, he attempted a sitcom anthology, Benny Hill, which ran from 1962 to 1963, in which he played a different character in each episode. In 1964, he played Nick Bottom in an all-star TV film production of William Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream. He also had a radio programme lasting for three series called Benny Hill Time, on BBC Radios BBC Light Programme Light Programme, from 1964 to 1966. It was a topical show, such as a March 1964 episode which featured James Pond, 0017, in "From Moscow with Love" and his version of "The Beatles". He played a number of characters in the series, such as Harry Hill and Fred Scuttle.

===Films and recordings===
Hills film credits include parts in five full-length feature films including Who Done It? (1956 film) Who Done It? (1956), Light Up the Sky! (film) Light Up the Sky! (1960), Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines (1965), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), in which he played the relatively straight role of the Toymaker, and The Italian Job (1969). He also made two Short film short-subject films, The Waiters (1969) and Eddie in August (1970), the latter being a TV production. Finally, a clip-show film spin-off of his early Thames Television shows (1969–73), called The Best of Benny Hill (1974), was a theatrically released compilation of The Benny Hill Show Benny Hill Show episodes. 

Hills audio recordings include "Gather in the Mushrooms" (1961), "Pepys Diary (song) Pepys Diary" (1961), "Transistor Radio (song) Transistor Radio" (1961), "Harvest of Love" (1963), and "Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West)", which was the UK Singles Chart Christmas number-one single in 1971.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

===The Benny Hill Show===
{{Main The Benny Hill Show}}
Hill had struggled on stage and had uneven success in radio, but in television, he found a form that played to his strengths. The Benny Hill Show had a music hall-derived format combining live on-stage comedy and filmed segments, and its humour relied on slapstick, innuendo, and parody. Recurring players on his show during the BBC years included Patricia Hayes, Jeremy Hawk, Peter Vernon, Ronnie Brody, and his co-writer from the early 1950s to early 1960s, Dave Freeman (British writer) Dave Freeman. Short, bald Jackie Wright was a frequent supporting player, who in many sketches had to put up with Hill slapping him on the top of his head.

Hill remained mostly with the BBC through to 1968, except for a few sojourns with ITV (TV network) ITV station Associated TeleVision ATV between 1957 and 1960 and again in 1967. In 1969, his show moved from the BBC to Thames Television, where it remained until cancellation in 1989, with an erratic schedule of one-hour specials. The series showcased Hills talents as an imaginative writer, comic performer, and impressionist. He may have bought scripts from various comedy writers, but if so, they never received an onscreen credit (some evidence indicates he bought a script from one of his regular cast members in 1976, Cherri Gilham, to whom he wrote from Spain and told her he was using her "Fat Lady idea on the show" in January 1977).

The most common running gag in Hills shows was the closing sequence, the "run-off", which was literally a running gag in that it featured various members of the cast chasing Hill, along with other stock comedy characters such as policemen, vicars, and old women. This was commonly filmed using "under-cranking" camera techniques, and included other comic devices such as characters running off one side of the screen and reappearing running on from the other. The tune used in all the chases, Boots Randolphs "Yakety Sax", is so strongly associated with the show that it is commonly referred to as "The Benny Hill Theme". It has been used as a form of parody in many ways by television shows and a small number of films. The Wachowskis used the same style (and musical theme) in a scene in the film V for Vendetta (film) V for Vendetta (2006)<ref>{{Citation title=V for Vendetta (2005) url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434409/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd accessdate=2017-05-31}}</ref>{{Citation needed date= May 2016}}. 

From the start of the 1980s, the show featured a troupe of attractive young women, known collectively as "Hills Angels". They would appear either on their own in a dance sequence, or in character as foils against Hill. Sue Upton was one of the longest-serving members of the Angels.  Jane Leeves appeared, as well. Henry McGee and Bob Todd joined Jackie Wright as comic supporting players, and the later shows also featured "Hills Little Angels", a group of cute children including the families of Dennis Kirkland (the shows director) and Sue Upton.

The alternative comedy alternative comedian Ben Elton made a headline-grabbing allegation, both on the TV show Saturday Live (UK TV series) Saturday Live and in the pages of Q (magazine) Q magazine (in its January 1987 issue), that The Benny Hill Show was single-handedly responsible for the incidences of rape in England during the period in question, and also suggested the programme incited other acts of violence against women.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n10_v44/ai_12270127/  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050303062641/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n10_v44/ai_12270127  dead-url=yes  archive-date=2005-03-03  title=The Benny Hill Show }} </ref> A writer in The Independent newspaper, though, opined that Eltons assault was, "like watching an elderly uncle being kicked to death by young thugs".<ref>Jemima Lewis [https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/jemima-lewis-why-did-the-british-disown-benny-hill-479887.html "Why did the British disown Benny Hill?"] The Independent, 27 May 2006</ref> Elton later claimed his comment was taken out of context, and he appeared in a parody for Harry Enfield and Chums, Benny Elton, where Elton ends up being chased by angry women, accompanied by the "Yakety Sax" theme, after trying to force them to be more feminist rather than letting them make their own decisions.

In response to the accusations of sexism, defenders of Hill have said the show used traditional comic stereotypes to reflect universal human truths in a way that was not malicious and fundamentally harmless. Hills friend and producer Dennis Kirkland said it was the women who chased Hill in anger for undressing them, all of which was done accidentally by some ridiculous means. An article on 27 May 2006 in The Independent quoted Hill and Kirkland as saying they believed this misrepresentation demonstrated critics could not have watched his programmes.{{Citation needed date= November 2011}}

In an episode about Hill transmitted as part of the documentary series Living Famously, John Howard Davies, the head of Light Entertainment at Thames Television, who had cancelled the show, stated  he did so for three reasons: "The audiences were going down, the programme was costing a vast amount of money, and he (Hill) was looking a little tired."{{Citation needed date= November 2011}}

The loss of his show was devastating for Hill (or, as one former supporting player put it, "He started to die from there",{{citation needed date=December 2014}}) and what followed was a self-inflicted decline in his health. In 1990, a new show was produced complete with Hill and his usual team, called Benny Hills World Tour: New York!.

In February 1992, Thames Television, which received a steady stream of requests from viewers for The Benny Hill Show repeats, finally gave in and put together a number of re-edited shows. Hill died on 20 April 1992, the same day that a new contract arrived in the post from ITV Central Central Independent Television, for which he was to have made a series of specials. He had turned down competing offers from Carlton and Thames.

==Celebrity fans==
Johnny Carson and side-kick Ed McMahon were both fans of Hill and tried several times to get him to come to Los Angeles and be a guest on Carsons The Tonight Show.  Hill always declined, citing not wanting to travel the great distance to California.

Radio and TV host Adam Carolla claimed that he was a fan of Hill and that he considered Hill "as American as the Beatles". Indeed, during an episode of The Man Show, Carolla performed in what was billed as a tribute to "our favourite Englishman, Sir Benny Hill" (Hill was never knighted) in more risqué versions of some of the sketches. Carolla played a rude and lecherous waiter, a typical Hill role, and the sketch featured many of the staples of Hills shows, including a Jackie Wright-esque bald man, as well as the usual scantily clad women.

Michael Jackson was a Hill fan: "I just love your Benny Hill," the young Jackson told a bemused English music-press critic during a 1970s tour, "hes so funny!" During the decline in Benny Hills health, he was visited by Jackson, who was in the UK at the time.

The British prog-rock band Genesis (band) Genesis may have been fans of Hill. In 1987, they filmed a video for their song "Anything She Does", featuring Benny as his character Fred Scuttle, an incompetent security guard who lets a ridiculous number of fans backstage at a Genesis concert.

In Benny Hill: The Worlds Favourite Clown, filmed shortly before his death, celebrities such as Burt Reynolds, Michael Caine, John Mortimer, Mickey Rooney, and Walter Cronkite, among others, expressed their appreciation of and admiration for Hill and his humour – and in Reynolds case, the appreciation extended to the Hills Angels, as well. More surprisingly, perhaps, the novelist Anthony Burgess made no secret of his admiration for Hill. Burgess, whose novels were often comic, relished language, wordplay, and dialect, admired the verbal and comedic skill that underlay Hills success. Reviewing a biography of Hill, Saucy Boy, in the Guardian in 1990, Burgess described Hill as "a comic genius steeped in the British music-hall tradition" and "one of the great artists of our age". A meeting between the two men was described in a newspaper article by Burgess and recalled in the Telegraph newspaper by the satirist Craig Brown (satirist) Craig Brown.<ref name="test">{{cite web url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3622509/Way-of-the-world.html title=Way of the world author=Craig Brown date=21 January 2006 work=Telegraph.co.uk accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref>

In 2006, broadcaster and critic Garry Bushell launched a campaign to erect a statue of Hill in Southampton, with the support of Barbara Windsor, Brian Conley, and other British comedy favourites. Those taking part in the first fundraising concert included Neville Staple, Right Said Fred, and Rick Wakeman.

In a June 2011 interview with The Observer, the American rapper Snoop Dogg declared himself to be a fan of Hill.<ref>Day, Elizabeth, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/19/snoop-dogg-doggumentary-interview Snoop Dogg: Women are getting empowered.

==Personal life==

Despite being a millionaire many times over, he continued with the frugal habits that he picked up from his parents, notably his father, such as buying cheap food at supermarkets, walking for miles rather than paying for a taxi unless someone picked up the tab for a limousine, and constantly patching and mending the same clothes even when the balance on his account at the Halifax Building Society reached seven figures.<ref name="everything2.com"/> In one of his obituaries, a story was told of how he reportedly refused to mend his mothers leaky roof because it was "too expensive",{{cn date=August 2016}} and after she died, he kept the family home in Southampton as a shrine to her and did not change a thing at all. 

Hill never married nor had children. He had proposed to two women, but neither accepted. Because of his eccentricity and reclusive lifestyle, rumours circulated that he was gay, but he always laughingly denied them.<ref name=neatorama.com>{{cite web last1=Cellania first1=Miss title=The Strange Life of Benny Hill url=http://www.neatorama.com/2013/10/24/The-Strange-Life-of-Benny-Hill/ website=neatorama.com publisher=<!-- Blank --> accessdate=5 July 2015 date=24 October 2015}}</ref>

Hill was a huge Francophile and enjoyed his visits to France, notably to Marseilles, where until the 1980s, he could go to outdoor cafes anonymously, travelling on public transport and socialising with local women.<ref name="neatorama.com"/> He spoke French language French fluently and also knew  basic German language German, Spanish language Spanish, Dutch language Dutch, and Italian language Italian.<ref name="neatorama.com"/>  Foreign travelling was the only luxury that he permitted himself, and even then, he would stay in modest accommodations rather than five-star hotels.<ref name="everything2.com"/>

==Death==
Benny Hills health declined in the late 1980s. After a mild heart attack on 24 February 1992, doctors told him he needed to lose weight and recommended a heart bypass. He declined, and a week later was found to have renal failure kidney failure. He died at the age of 68 on 20 April 1992.<ref name="NYTimes"/> On 22 April, after several days of unanswered telephone calls, his producer, Dennis Kirkland, climbed a ladder to the window of Hills second-floor flat<ref>{{cite web url=http://flashbak.com/the-rise-fall-and-lonely-death-of-benny-hill-371668/ title=The Rise, Fall, and Lonely Death of Benny Hill author= date=22 January 2017 website=flashbak.com}}</ref> and upon seeing the body through a window, had the neighbours call the police. The police broke into the flat and found Hill, dead, sitting in his armchair in front of the television. The cause of death was recorded as coronary thrombosis.<ref>{{cite web last=Took first=Barry title=Hill, Alfred Hawthorne [Benny] (1924–1992), comedian url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51126 work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography publisher=Oxford University Press accessdate=6 June 2011}}</ref> Hills body was buried at Hollybrook Cemetery near his birthplace in Southampton on 26 April 1992. 

During the night of 4 October 1992, following speculation in the media that Hill had been buried with a large amount of gold and jewellery, grave robbers excavated the grave at Hollybrook Cemetery and broke open its coffin, the open graves condition being found by a passer-by the following morning. After a police examination of the scene, the coffin was reclosed and the grave filled back in by cemetery workers, and as a security measure, a 1-ft-thick concrete slab was placed over it.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12587521.Grave_of_Benny_Hill_desecrated/ title=Grave of Benny Hill desecrated author= date= 5 October 1992 website=HeraldScotland}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 1998, Channel 4 featured Hill in one of its Heroes of Comedy programmes. On 28 December 2006, Channel 4 broadcast the documentary Is Benny Hill Still Funny? The programme featured an audience that comprised a Cross-sectional data cross-section of young adults who had little or no knowledge of Hill, to discover whether his comedy was valid to a generation that enjoyed the likes of Little Britain, The Catherine Tate Show, and Borat. The participants were asked to watch a 30-minute compilation that included examples of Hills humour from both his BBC and ITV shows. The responses and results demonstrated that none of the sample of viewers took offence at any of the sketches shown. His silent "Wishing Well" sketch was discovered to be the most popular.{{citation required date=July 2018}}
