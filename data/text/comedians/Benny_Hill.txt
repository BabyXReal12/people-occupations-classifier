– 20 April 1992) was an English comedian and actor, best remembered for his television programme The Benny Hill Show, an amalgam of slapstick, burlesque, and double entendre in a format that included live comedy and filmed segments, with him at the focus of almost every segment. 

Hill was a prominent figure in British culture for nearly four decades, and his show proved to be one of the great success stories of television comedy and was among the most-watched programmes in the UK; the audience peaked at more than 21 million in 1971.
==Early life==
Alfred Hawthorne Hill was born on 21 January 1924 in Southampton, on the south coast of England. His father, Alfred Hill (later manager of a surgical appliance shop
that mostly sold condoms
), and grandfather, Henry Hill, had both been circus clowns.
After leaving school, Hill worked at Woolworths Group Woolworths,
as a milkman, a bridge operator, a driver, and a drummer before becoming assistant stage manager with a touring revue. He was Conscription called up in 1942 and trained as a mechanic in the British Army. He served as a mechanic, truck driver, and searchlight operator in Normandy after September 1944
and later transferred to the Combined Services Entertainment
division before the end of the war.

Inspired by the "star comedians" of British music hall shows, Hill set out to make his mark in show business. He changed his name to "Benny" in homage to his favourite comedian, Jack Benny.
