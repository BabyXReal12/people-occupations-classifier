===Early work===
On October 30, 1992, Cook and a group of local emerging improv/sketch comedians were scheduled to appear at the Boston Garden as part of local radio station WBCN (FM) WBCNs "Rock of Boston" music concert. Although they anticipated appearing earlier in the lineup, they were scheduled to perform between popular band Spin Doctors and the final headline act Phish, making them somewhat nervous but determined to do well. Moments after they took the stage however, the crowd, neither expecting nor appreciating a comedy act at this late stage in the evenings program and impatient for Phish to go on, expressed their displeasure by throwing their shoes at the stage. Robert Kelly (comedian) Robert Kelly, also on stage as a member of the comedy group, pleaded with the audience to settle down and let them perform their act; the crowd instead escalated to throwing lighters. Sustaining minor injuries, Cook and the comedy group left the stage. Cook described the incident – as well as how dejected he felt and his resulting determination to someday return to the Boston Garden and perform successfully someday – as part of a web series for The Tonight Show entitled "Worst I Ever Bombed".<ref>{{cite av media url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ArgJy-K0YE#t=42 title=Worst I Ever Bombed: Dane Cook date=3 October 2014 work=YouTube accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.relix.com/blogs/detail/video_a_phish_crowd_threw_shoes_and_lighters_at_dane_cook title=Video: A Phish Crowd Threw Shoes and Lighters at Dane Cook work=Relix accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>

In 2012, Cook caused a minor controversy when a joke he made in a comedy club about the 2012 Aurora shooting was recorded and made the news headlines. "So I heard that the guy came into the theater about 25 minutes into the movie. And I don’t know if you’ve seen the movie, but the movie is pretty much a piece of crap… Yeah, spoiler alert. And I know that if none of that would have happened, I’m pretty sure that somebody in that theater, about 25 minutes in, realizing it was a piece of crap, probably was like, ‘Ugh f—king shoot me.’" He later took to Twitter to apologize, "I am devastated by the recent tragedy in Colorado & did not mean to make light of what happened. I made a bad judgment call with my material last night & regret making a joke at such a sensitive time. My heart goes out to all of the families & friends of the victims"<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.ew.com/article/2012/07/27/dane-cook-aurora-shooting-joke title=Dane Cook jokes about Aurora shooting work=Entertainment Weeklys EW.com accessdate=22 August 2015 first=Jeff last=Labrecque date=July 27, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZATGRjj1G4 title=Dane Cook Laugh Factory Jokes about Aurora Colorado Shooting Dark Knight Murders date=27 July 2012 work=YouTube accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://gawker.com/5929595/dane-cook-jokes-about-aurora-shooting-on-stage-less-than-one-week-after-massacre  title=Dane Cook Jokes About Aurora Shooting on Stage Less Than One Week After Massacre  author=Neetzan Zimmerman  publisher=Gawker Media  work=Gawker  accessdate=22 August 2015  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921203742/http://gawker.com/5929595/dane-cook-jokes-about-aurora-shooting-on-stage-less-than-one-week-after-massacre  archivedate=21 September 2015  df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/27/dane-cook-aurora-shooting-joke_n_1710221.html title=Dane Cook Tells Theater Shooting Joke work=The Huffington Post accessdate=22 August 2015 date=July 27, 2012}}</ref>

===Style===
Cooks style is principally "long-form storytelling"<ref>[http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2009/10/dane_cook_finds_humor_in_darke.html Dane Cook finds humor in darkest times on latest tour, coming to Van Andel Arena on Friday] Grand Rapids Press</ref> and "multipurpose phrases".<ref name="salon2006"/> Cook says his onstage persona is a combination of the personalities of his mom, Donna, and his dad, George. "My mother is like a Looney Tunes cartoon. Shes wiggly ... She has the ability to tongue in cheek a lot, and do it in a way where shes being physical. My dad is the polar opposite. He always had a little what the fuck in his voice. Even if he knew nothing about what he was talking about, he could sell it. So I looked at these two extremely funny people and created a style of comedy from absorbing their actions."<ref>{{cite web url=http://punchlinemagazine.com/site/?p=224 title=Dane Cook: All Aboard the Dane Train, &#39;Punchline&#39; magazine publisher=Punchlinemagazine.com date=2005-11-07 accessdate=2010-05-23}}</ref>

He explains: {{quote text=I wanted to create a stage persona for myself that allowed me to really speak about anything I want... So I can be a storyteller, I can be jokey, I can be corny, I can be a little vulgar, I can be a lot vulgar. And Im not afraid to go anywhere to get the point of the joke across, even if I have to just blabber like a retard until it becomes apparent that Im a retard and that the audience should laugh.}}
