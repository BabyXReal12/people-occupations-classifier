===Early work===
On October 30, 1992, Cook and a group of local emerging improv/sketch comedians were scheduled to appear at the Boston Garden as part of local radio station WBCN (FM) WBCNs "Rock of Boston" music concert. Although they anticipated appearing earlier in the lineup, they were scheduled to perform between popular band Spin Doctors and the final headline act Phish, making them somewhat nervous but determined to do well. Moments after they took the stage however, the crowd, neither expecting nor appreciating a comedy act at this late stage in the evenings program and impatient for Phish to go on, expressed their displeasure by throwing their shoes at the stage. Robert Kelly (comedian) Robert Kelly, also on stage as a member of the comedy group, pleaded with the audience to settle down and let them perform their act; the crowd instead escalated to throwing lighters. Sustaining minor injuries, Cook and the comedy group left the stage. Cook described the incident – as well as how dejected he felt and his resulting determination to someday return to the Boston Garden and perform successfully someday – as part of a web series for The Tonight Show entitled "Worst I Ever Bombed".
===Stand-up===
In 1994, Cook moved to New York City and began performing. Two years later, he moved to Los Angeles, where he still lives today.
His big break came in 1998 when he appeared on Comedy Centrals Premium Blend. In 2000, Cook did a half-hour special on Comedy Central Presents. Since then his special has won the Stand-up showdown Comedy Central Stand-up showdown twice in a row.
In 2003, Cook released his first Compact Disc CD/DVD, Harmful If Swallowed. He signed a contract with Comedy Central Records. The album is Music recording sales certification certified platinum. He released his second CD/DVD in 2005, entitled Retaliation (Dane Cook album) Retaliation. This album went Music recording sales certification double platinum and made Cook the first comic in 29 years to have an album at #4 on the Billboard charts.
He performed at the MTV Video Music Awards, and then afterwards he joined Snoop Dogg in presenting the award for MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist Best New Artist.
On April 15, 2005, Cook performed his first HBO Special entitled Vicious Circle. Dane Cook: Vicious Circle Vicious Circle was filmed "Theatre in the round in the round" at the TD Garden. The same year, Cook shot two pilot episodes for his own sitcom, Cooked. The sitcom never got picked up and the two pilot episodes were later released on DVD as the Lost Pilot Episodes. That same year, he embarked on a 30-day, 20-show college tour called Tourgasm with his longtime friends Robert Kelly (comedian) Robert Kelly, Gary Gulman, and Jay Davis. The tour was filmed and was later made into a 9-episode documentary on HBO.

On December 3, 2005, Cook hosted Saturday Night Live (SNL). He would then go on to host the premiere of season 32 of SNL a year later.

In 2006, Cook headlined for Dave Attells Insomniac Tour and hosted the 2006 Teen Choice Awards alongside Jessica Simpson. The following year he won the award for Best Comedian. On November 12, 2007, Cook became the second comic to sell out Madison Square Garden. He did two sold out shows in one night. The show was filmed and would later be put onto a DVD to be sold on Cooks third comedy album. Cook won the Big Entertainer Award at the VH1 Big in 06 Awards, and Rolling Stone magazines Hot Comic of the Year. The following day, November 13, 2007, he released his third CD/DVD entitled Rough Around The Edges, which was filmed live at Madison Square Garden in New York City. During that time, he embarked on his first arena tour.

On April 10, 2007, Cook broke the Laugh Factorys endurance record (previously held by Richard Pryor)
by performing on stage for three hours and 50 minutes. Dave Chappelle would break the record five days later by performing for six hours and seven minutes. Chappelle beat that record on December 3, 2007 by performing for six hours and twelve minutes.
On January 1, 2008, Cook broke Chappelles record, by performing on stage for seven hours.
From May 23, 2008 to May 25, 2008, Cook reunited with Robert Kelly and Al Del Bene for three shows at The Coliseum in Caesars Palace. From May 29-June 4, 2008 the trio went to Iraq to perform for the troops. Del Bene was the Emcee, Kelly was the Feature, and Cook was the Headliner.

He finished his fourth album, Isolated Incident; a performance which aired on Comedy Central on May 17, 2009, with the release of the record following two days later. He kicked off that tour at the Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut, on April 25, 2009. This album will be the last as part of Cooks four-record deal with Comedy Central Records. The new album was performed at Laugh Factory in Hollywood, which is considered to be Cooks home base, where he goes and works on new material. He released the DVD version of Isolated Incident in November 2009.
In 2012, Cook caused a minor controversy when a joke he made in a comedy club about the 2012 Aurora shooting was recorded and made the news headlines. "So I heard that the guy came into the theater about 25 minutes into the movie. And I don’t know if you’ve seen the movie, but the movie is pretty much a piece of crap… Yeah, spoiler alert. And I know that if none of that would have happened, I’m pretty sure that somebody in that theater, about 25 minutes in, realizing it was a piece of crap, probably was like, ‘Ugh f—king shoot me.’" He later took to Twitter to apologize, "I am devastated by the recent tragedy in Colorado &amp; did not mean to make light of what happened. I made a bad judgment call with my material last night &amp; regret making a joke at such a sensitive time. My heart goes out to all of the families &amp; friends of the victims"
In 2014, Showtime (TV network) Showtime aired Cooks Troublemaker special.
===Style===
Cooks style is principally "long-form storytelling"
and "multipurpose phrases".
Cook says his onstage persona is a combination of the personalities of his mom, Donna, and his dad, George. "My mother is like a Looney Tunes cartoon. Shes wiggly ... She has the ability to tongue in cheek a lot, and do it in a way where shes being physical. My dad is the polar opposite. He always had a little what the fuck in his voice. Even if he knew nothing about what he was talking about, he could sell it. So I looked at these two extremely funny people and created a style of comedy from absorbing their actions."
He explains: {{quote text=I wanted to create a stage persona for myself that allowed me to really speak about anything I want... So I can be a storyteller, I can be jokey, I can be corny, I can be a little vulgar, I can be a lot vulgar. And Im not afraid to go anywhere to get the point of the joke across, even if I have to just blabber like a retard until it becomes apparent that Im a retard and that the audience should laugh.}}

===Reception===
Commentators in a variety of media sources have characterized Dane Cooks humor as unfunny.
Comedian Ron White has criticized Dane Cook for his lack of real material and for his inflated ego; saying "[He] does not make me laugh, at all, in any way, shape or form."
When asked about his opinion of Cook on The Howard Stern Show, comedian Nick DiPaolo said "he doesnt make me laugh, but that doesnt mean hes not funny."
On Boston radio station WBCN (FM) WBCN, Dane Cook was named by radio show Toucher and Rich to a tournament of the top 16 "Worst Comedians" and, based on listener voting, was voted the "Worst Comedian" of all. In the Michigan Daily, Elie Zwiebel and co-author Jesse Bean wrote that "hes managed to become one of the most overrated comics ever" and that his act is "boringly stagnant".
In an interview with Jason Tanamor of Zoiks! Online, Tanamor asked Cook why he was so despised. Cook stated that hed had conversations with his therapist, attributing some of the negativity to his alpha demeanor. Add to that, Cooks highly successful career. "Unfortunately, what you find is, you know in your graduating class with the guys you came up with, theres going to be some dudes in front of you that don’t want you catching up, and theres going to be some guys behind you that maybe they’ve never had an opportunity. That, coupled with, like you said, reaching the Billboard charts with ‘Retaliation’ and a lot of people going, ‘Who the fuck does he think he is?’
Jim Breuer talked about Cooks reputation within the comedy industry, saying: "Everyone kills this guy ... Not one comedian comes on [my Sirius radio show] and says Im so happy for him, which is weird. ... They cant stand this poor guy." Breuer went on to say that he personally thinks Cook is a "tremendous performer".
Paul Provenza said that he was not a fan of his earlier work, but "...caught a couple of Dane Cook shows at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, and he was fantastic", and became a fan because he felt he had "matured".
====Accusations of plagiarism====
Comedian Joe Rogan has claimed that Cook performed a bit on an episode of Premium Blend that Rogan had developed on Im Gonna Be Dead Someday (sketch titled "Tigers Fucking"), and claimed to have performed the routine earlier in clubs with Cook present.
Other comedians have also accused Cook of stealing their material. A 2007 article in Radar (magazine) Radar magazine about joke theft included Rogans allegations, as well as the allegations of an anonymous "veteran comic" who accused Cook of appropriating one of that comics "very physical routines", despite a direct request by the comedian that Cook stop using the routine in question.
The piece also noted widespread Internet discussion of the similarity between the bits "Struck by a Vehicle", "Itchy Asshole", and "My Son Optimus Prime", from Cooks 2005 album Retaliation (Dane Cook album) Retaliation, and the bits "Guy on a Bike", "Itchy Asshole", and "Kids Names", from comic Louis C.K.s 2001 album Live in Houston (Louis C.K. album) Live in Houston.
In 2011, Cook played himself in an episode of Louie (U.S. TV series) Louie, scripted by C.K., centering on a fictional encounter between the two comics during which they discuss the controversy.
In an interview in 2012, Louis C.K. defended Cook, saying "I dont think he stole from me knowingly... I think he sort of got some of my jokes in his head and got sloppy. Hes a good guy and not capable of maleficence."
