===Refugee===
Do and his family fled to Australia as refugees in 1980.<ref name="The Age">{{cite news  url=http://www.theage.com.au/money/investing/profile-anh-do-20110201-1abk3.html   location=Melbourne   work=The Age   title=Profile: Anh Do   date=2 February 2011}}</ref> In his 2010 autobiography, The Happiest Refugee, Do tells of how his family survived five days in a leaky fishing boat nine and a half metres long and two metres wide. During the trip his family and the rest of the passengers were attacked by two different bands of pirates. The first group stole one out of the two engines and the second group of pirates stole the second engine, which had been broken but repaired by Dos father using a piece of rubber from a thong. It was reported that as the second band of pirates left, one of them threw a gallon of water onboard which kept all but one of the refugees alive, until they were finally rescued by a German merchant ship.<ref name="Happiest Refugee">{{Cite book last=Do first=Anh title=The Happiest Refugee  url=https://www.allenandunwin.com/browse/books/general-books/biography-autobiography/The-Happiest-Refugee-Anh-Do-9781742372389  publisher=Allen&Unwin year=2010 isbn=978-1-74237-238-9}}</ref> The boat was packed with 40 Vietnamese Australians Vietnamese refugees fleeing across the Indian Ocean.
