==Career==

===Early career===
After spending his first year out of college with friends in California,<ref name="M & C">{{cite web url=http://arts.monstersandcritics.com/features/article_1166663.php/Stephen_Lynch_From_comic_songster_to_Wedding_Singer title=Monsters and Critics: Stephen Lynch: From comic songster to Wedding Singer publisher= deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824135936/http://arts.monstersandcritics.com/features/article_1166663.php/Stephen_Lynch_From_comic_songster_to_Wedding_Singer archivedate=August 24, 2006 df=mdy-all}}</ref> Lynch moved to New York City in 1996 with the intention of becoming an actor.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/415137p-350834c.html title=New York Daily News, "Wedding Zinger" publisher= deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517141525/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/415137p-350834c.html archivedate=May 17, 2006 df=mdy-all}}</ref> Upon his arrival, a friend at the Laurie Beechman Theatre West Bank Cafe on 42nd Street suggested Lynch play, for an audience, some of the comic songs he had written while attending university.<ref name = "ZPincus-Roth" /> He soon found success in comedy clubs and other venues around the city (notably Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs) Catch a Rising Star<ref name = "What Are Records?" /> and Carolines<ref name="Stephen Lynch: Tour History">{{cite web url=http://www.stephenlynch.com/tour/history.html title=Stephen Lynch: Tour History publisher= deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509054757/http://www.stephenlynch.com/tour/history.html archivedate=May 9, 2006 df=mdy-all}}</ref>), and became a regular on radio shows such as Opie and Anthony.<ref name="What Are Records?" >{{cite web url=http://www.whatarerecords.com title=What Are Records? website=www.whatarerecords.com}}</ref><ref name="Stephen Lynch: Press" /> Lynch spent his early years in New York City doing what he called "totally mindless work" as a temp worker. He quit such temporary jobs permanently, signing with What Are Records? in 2000 and Vision International in 2002.

Over the next few years, he toured colleges, universities and nightclubs around the country, avoiding as much as possible the comedy club circuit, which he has stated is not to his taste. He periodically returned to Michigan to do summer stock.<ref name = "WMA" /><ref name="Playbill" /><ref>{{cite web url=http://video.broadwayworld.com/showvideos/weddingseattle.html title=Untitled Document website=video.broadwayworld.com}}</ref> During his March 6, 2009 appearance on The Bob and Tom Show, Lynch mentioned "Steel Toast" as the name of the band in which he first performed. As of the start of his 3 Balloons tour in Spring 2009, Agency for the Performing Arts books all of his concert dates.<ref name="M & C" />

===2000 to present===
As a result of the duality of his act, Lynch turned heads in the music industry as well as on the comedy circuit. He attracted extra attention usually not available to comics by playing venues more often suited to music than to comedy (eventually graduating to locations such as the House of Blues, The Town Hall<ref name = "UGO" /> and the esteemed Carnegie Hall).<ref name = "Stephen Lynch: Tour History" /> He gained great national exposure with his Comedy Central Presents special in 2000, one of the highest rated in the networks history. He has made appearances on Comedy Centrals Premium Blend, The World Comedy Tour and The World Stands Up. He has also made four appearances on Last Call with Carson Daly, and has performed at the prestigious Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.<ref name = "Stephen Lynch: Press" />

Lynch has opened for comedians Jay Mohr, Jeff Foxworthy, Steven Wright, Bobcat Goldthwait and Lewis Black. In the summer of 2004, he went on a tour co-headlining with Mitch Hedberg. The tour was such a success that they added an extra leg and ran into 2005. This was Hedbergs last tour before his death.

He has also appeared in five short films, including The Love Seat in 1999 and The Confetti Brothers in 2001.<ref name = "WMA" >{{cite web url=http://www.wma.com/stephen_lynch/summary/ title=WME website=www.wma.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1392557/ title=Stephen Lynch website=IMDb}}</ref><ref name = "Broadway.com" /> Both films were written and directed by Kirker Butler. The Confetti Brothers, a satire, screened to packed houses at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. It continues to play the film festival circuit.<ref name = "courier-journal.com">{{cite web url=http://www.courier-journal.com/scene/movies/features/2002/20020702butler.html title=courier-journal.com: Louisville Scene: Hollywoods Kentucky connection adds a link publisher=}}</ref>

In April 2006, Lynch starred as Robbie Hart in the Broadway theatre Broadway musical The Wedding Singer (musical) The Wedding Singer, which ran on Broadway from April 27, 2006 through December 31, 2006 at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre.<ref name = "ZPincus-Roth" /> This musical production was based on the 1998 New Line Cinema film The Wedding Singer starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. The musical, Lynchs Broadway debut,<ref name = "ZPincus-Roth" /><ref name = "Broadway.com" >{{cite web url=http://www.broadway.com/gen/Buzz_Star_File.aspx?ci=519869 title=Broadway Buzz - Videos, Interviews, Photos, News and Tickets - Broadway.com website=www.broadway.com}}</ref> co-starred Tony Award Tony winner Laura Benanti in the role of Julia Sullivan, played by Barrymore in the film. The April 2006 opening followed a successful preview run in Seattle at 5th Avenue Theatre The 5th Avenue Theatre which ran from January 31 through February 19. His performance has earned him nominations for Tony Award Tony, Drama League Award Drama League and Drama Desk Award Drama Desk awards,<ref name = "Playbill" /> According to interviews after, he stated that, due to the rehearsals for the show, he had forgotten most of his own songs.

In 2007, Lynch returned to the road again, touring with comedians such as Bob Saget, Frank Caliendo, Louis C.K., Carlos Mencia and others on the Opie and Anthonys Traveling Virus Comedy Tour during Opie and Anthonys Traveling Virus Comedy Tour (2007) 2007.

Lynch starred in his second Comedy Central Presents special in January 2008.

Lynch performed on his first European tours in 2008, headlining concerts in England, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Finland, Ireland, Scotland and Germany. All but two of the seventeen shows sold out, despite never playing a majority of the markets. Lynch attributes this success to YouTube.

His newfound European popularity resulted in appearances at six festivals in August and September 2008. He played in the UK at the Reading and Leeds Festivals, headlining the Alternative stage at each site. He also appeared at the Lowlands Festival in the Netherlands on August 17, Edinburgh Edge Festival (during Edinburgh Festival Fringe Fringe) on August 24, The Pimms Summerfest in Holland Park, London on August 28, and Bulmers Comedy Festival in Dublin at the Olympia Theater on September 1 and 2.

In June 2011, among other venues, Lynch performed at Kulturens Hus in LuleÃ¥, Sweden.

On March 6, 2011, while replying to a message on Twitter, Lynch announced that he was working on a new CD. When asked if it would be studio or live, he replied "Im leaning studio." Lion (Stephen Lynch album) Lion, a double live/studio album, was released on November 13, 2012 to solid reviews.<ref>{{cite web title=Stephen Lynch Lion album review url=http://www.thespittake.com/2012/11/13/stephen-lynch-lion-what-are-records/ accessdate=April 6, 2013}}</ref><ref name = "whatarerecords.com">{{cite web url=http://whatarerecords.com/stephen_lynch/bio.html title=What Are Records? - Stephen Lynch: bio website=whatarerecords.com}}</ref>

==Personal life==
He married Erin Dwight on a private beach on Lake Michigan in September 2003,<ref name="Playbill" /> and she is generally the first person to hear his original ideas for songs;  if she does not laugh at the initial concept, he will scrap the idea completely.<ref name="Recoil" /> Dwight recorded a short film while her husband was away touring, called Lynch and Teich in Brooklyn, to show that she missed him. This was included in the extras on his 2004 concert DVD, Live at the El Rey (DVD) Live at the El Rey. She also co-created the cover concept for the album, The Craig Machine, with her mother, Kalamazoo, Michigan Kalamazoo photographer Fran Dwight.

Lynch has a younger brother, Drew (not standup comic Drew Lynch, who is unrelated). Lynch and his brother occasionally tour together. Their parents are a former priest and a former nun.<ref name="M & C" /><ref>{{cite news  first=Andrew  last=Guyton  url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2005-11-18/entertainment/2  title=Stephen Lynch satisfies with Craig Machine  work=The Technique  date=November 18, 2005  accessdate=2007-04-04  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929141144/http://www.nique.net/issues/2005-11-18/entertainment/2 <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->  archivedate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Both parents became teachers.<ref name="ZPincus-Roth" /> Lynch has stated that religion was not forced upon him growing up, and, although he was raised Roman Catholic, he no longer attends church. His upbringing included liberalism as well as religion, which is reflected through his fathers past as part of a singing duo that attended many peace rallies and antiwar protests during the Vietnam War.<ref name="M & C" /> Like his sons, Lynchs father was a stage actor as well as a singer, and musical talent and interest runs in their family. Lynchs earliest work in the theater was performing with his father in local community theater productions in Saginaw as a child. The first live musical he saw was Man of La Mancha, a community theater production in which his father played the role of the Padre.<ref name="ZPincus-Roth" >{{cite web url=http://zpincusroth.typepad.com/blog/2006/02/one_to_watch_st.html title=One to Watch: Stephen Lynch website=Zachary Pincus-Roth.com}}</ref><ref name="Playbill" >{{cite web url=http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/99485.html title=Playbill Celebrity Buzz: THE LEADING MEN: The Ring and I publisher=}}</ref>

As Lynchs repertoire of material includes some duets and also a few songs for three voices, close university pals and fellow comedians Mark Teich (of The Second City) and Rod Cone (of The Rod Cone Situation) are also very frequent guests on his tours, and he rarely tours alone. He has also done shows with former Wedding Singer castmate David Josefsberg.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.lynch-mob.net title=Lynch-mob.net publisher= deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050323233110/http://lynch-mob.net/ archivedate=March 23, 2005 df=mdy-all}}</ref>
