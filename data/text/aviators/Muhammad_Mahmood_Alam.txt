Muhammad Mahmood Alam Sitara-e-Jurat SJ ({{lang-ur {{Nastaliq محمد محمود عالم}}}}, {{lang-bn {{lang bn মোহাম্মদ মাহমূদ আলম}}}}; 6 July 1935 – 18 March 2013) was
a Pakistani fighter pilot who was officially credited by the Pakistanis with having downed nine Indian Air Force aircraft during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, including five Hawker Hunter aircraft on one sortie on 7 September 1.
However succeeding scholars, including retired Pakistan Air Force PAF Air Commodore Sajad S.Haider have since debunked this incident as a flight of fancy.
He was a North American F-86 Sabre F-86 Sabre flying ace as per Pakistan records and One-star rank one-star general in the Pakistan Air Force. He was awarded the Sitara-e-Jurat ("The star of courage"), the nations third highest military award and Bar for his actions during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.

==Early life==
Alam was born on 6 July 1935 to a well-educated family of Calcutta, British India. Born and raised in Bengal, Alam was a fluent Bengali language Bengali speaker, however his paternal line was of Urdu-speaking Bihari people Bihari origin; having emigrated from Patna and settled in the Bengal Presidency Bengal province of British India for a long time.
The family migrated from Calcutta to eastern Bengal which became East Pakistan following the formation of Pakistan in 1947.
It was in East Pakistan, where Alam completed his secondary education, graduating from the Government High School in Dhaka in 1951. He joined the then RPAF (now PAF) in 1952, being commissioned on 2 October 1953.
Alams brothers are M. Shahid Alam, an economist and a professor at Northeastern University, Boston Northeastern University,
and Mohammad Sajjad Alam M. Sajjad Alam, a particle physicist at SUNY Albany.
His family moved to West Pakistan in around 1971, after the secession of East Pakistan.
Being the eldest of his 11 siblings, Alam did not marry as he had to assume the responsibilities of the upbringing of his family. Some of his younger brothers became distinguished in various academic careers.

Alam was listed on the top of the hall of fame list at the PAF Museum in Karachi. Alam is considered a national hero for Pakistan, most significantly for his service in the war of 1965 when he was posted at Sargodha. During this war he was involved in various dogfights while flying his F-86 Sabre fighter. Alams credited kills are as follows:

* 6 September 1965, 1× Hawker Hunter
** Squadron Leader Ajit Kumar Rawlley, No. 7 Sqn, Killed in action KIA near Tarn Taran Sahib Tarn Taran.
* 7 September 1965, 5× Hawker Hunters
** Squadron Leader Onkar Nath Kacker, No. 27 Sqn, POW
** Squadron Leader Ajjamada B Devaiah A B Devayya, No. 7 Sqn. (IAF shows him a Mystere Pilot &amp; he belonged to No 1 Squadron)
** Squadron Leader Suresh B Bhagwat, No. 7 Sqn
** Flight Lieutenant B Guha, No. 7 Sqn
** Flying Officer Jagdev Singh Brar, No. 7 Sqn, KIA, near Sangla Hill.
* 16 September 1965, 1× Hawker Hunter
** Flying Officer Farokh Dara Bunsha, No. 7 Sqn, KIA, near Amritsar.
Although the figures have been confirmed by some independent sources,
Indian as well as some Pakistani mainstream sources have rejected this claim as a flight of fancy, according to some of these sources Alam made only four kills, with some sources attributing one of the losses of Sqn Ldr Onkar Nath Kackers aircraft to technical failure or some other cause, including the possibility of ground fire.
Also the fact that the gun camera footage of Alams kills was never made public by the Pakistani authorities, the veracity of his claims cannot be ascertained. In 1978, when Alam gave speech in Karachi university he told that during the fight he saw a spiritual force coming from the sky.
In 1967, Alam was transferred as the Squadron Commander of the first squadron of Dassault Mirage III fighters procured by the Pakistan Air Force PAF. He was removed from staff college over his alleged excessive involvement with Tableeghi Jamat and focusing more on preaching religion instead of carrying out his core responsibilities. In 1982, Alam retired as an Air commodore and took up residence in Karachi. Since retiring, Alam had become more deeply interested in religion.

The Air Force legend was admitted to Pakistan Naval Station Shifa Hospital in Karachi.
