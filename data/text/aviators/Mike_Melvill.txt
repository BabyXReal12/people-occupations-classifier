==Life and career==

In 1978, Melvill met aerospace designer and Scaled Composites founder Burt Rutan when he flew to California to show Rutan the Rutan VariViggen VariViggen he had built at his home. Rutan then hired him on the spot. In 1982, he was named Rutans lead test pilot.
In 1997, Melvill and Dick Rutan, Burts brother, flew two Rutan Long-EZ Long-Eze aircraft that they built side-by-side around the world. This "around the world in 80 nights" flight was called The Spirit of Experimental Aircraft Association EAA Friendship World Tour, and some legs of it lasted for over 14 hours.
Later in his career he became Vice President/General Manager at Scaled Composites.
