==Early life==
Dunham was born in Dallas, Texas on April 18, 1962.<ref>{{cite web title=Jeff Dunham Biography url=http://www.biography.com/people/jeff-dunham-20682855 publisher=Biography.com accessdate=December 23, 2011}}</ref><ref name=OfficialBio>The biography page on [http://www.jeffdunham.com/#/bio Dunhams official site] established his year of birth when it was accessed on April 17, 2009, but had been removed by November 28, 2009.

He began ventriloquism in 1970 at age eight, when his parents gave him a Mortimer Snerd dummy for Christmas, and an accompanying how-to album.<ref name=OfficialBio/> The next day he checked out a how-to book on ventriloquism from the library,<ref name=NewYorkTimes/><ref name=BirthOfADummy/> and explained in 2011 that he still had it, remarking that he was "a thief in the third grade". By the fourth grade, Dunham decided he not only wanted to be a professional ventriloquist, but the best one ever.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/> Dunham began practicing for hours in front of a mirror, studying the routines of Edgar Bergen, and the how-to record Jimmy Nelsons Instant Ventriloquism,<ref name=NewYorkTimes/> finding ventriloquism to be a learned skill, similar to juggling, that anyone with a normal speaking voice can acquire.<ref name=Rotorway>[http://www.kitplanes.com/magazine/rotorcraft/204-1.phtml Jeff Dunham. "Building a Rotorway 162F Part 1 of 8: How I got into this."] {{Webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309035533/http://www.kitplanes.com/magazine/rotorcraft/204-1.phtml  date=9 March 2009 }} KITPLANES Magazine, March 1997.</ref> Dunham has explained that, as an only child, he enjoyed being alone, likening his solitude to a "warm blanket" with which he could explore his own thoughts and ideas, which prepared him for the solitude of living alone when he later moved to Los Angeles as a struggling comedian.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/>

When Dunham was in the sixth grade, he began attending the Vent Haven ConVENTion in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, an annual international meeting of ventriloquists that includes competitions, where he met Jimmy Nelson (ventriloquist) Jimmy Nelson in person. Dunham has missed only one ConVENTion since then, in 1977. The organizers of the ConVENTion eventually declared Dunham a "retired champion", ineligible from entering any more competitions, as other attendees were too intimidated to compete against him. The Vent Haven Museum devotes a section to Dunham, alongside Señor Wences and Dunhams idol, Edgar Bergen.<ref name=NewYorkTimes/>

==Career==
===Beginnings===
Dunham began performing for audiences as a teenager,<ref name=OfficialBio/> in various venues such as school, church, and during his job at Six Flags. By his middle school years, he began to perform for banquets attended by local celebrities such as Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach, having developed his style of lampooning those he performed for, using the puppets to say things too risque for him to say without them.<ref name=NewYorkTimes/> Dunhams television debut came in 1976 when the still prepubescent performer caught the attention of Dallas reporters like Bill OReilly (political commentator) Bill OReilly, who interviewed Dunham for a local news story.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/> Dunham later did commercials for Datsun dealerships in Dallas and Tyler, Texas Tyler while still in high school.<ref name=NewYorkTimes/><ref name=BirthOfADummy/> While emceeing a high school talent show, he dealt with a heckler, and won over the rest of the audience.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/> During this period he became so associated with his craft that he and one of his dummies "cowrote" a column in the school paper, and he would pose with his dummies for yearbooks<ref name=NewYorkTimes/> as an inexpensive way to acquire professional photos of his act for promotional purposes.<ref name=AllByMySelves>{{cite book last=Dunham first=Jeff title=All By My Selves: Walter, Peanut, Achmed and Me publisher=Dutton Adult date=November 2010 isbn=0-525-95141-5}}</ref> He was voted Most Likely to Succeed, and in 1980, after he graduated from high school, Dunham gave himself a career goal of obtaining, within ten years, an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, which was seen as the "holy grail" for comedians.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/>

That year Dunham began attending Baylor University, hoping to graduate with a degree in communications, while performing around campus.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/> He would also fly around the country on weekends,<ref name=NewYorkTimes/> doing up to 100 private shows a year,<ref name=BirthOfADummy/> entertaining corporate customers such as General Electric, whose CEO, Jack Welch, he mocked during his routine.<ref name=NewYorkTimes/> By his junior year in college (1983–84), Dunham was making $70,000 a year, and as word spread of his act, he landed featured spots opening for Bob Hope and George Burns, though he still perceived his act as raw, as he did not have any knowledge of standup comedy beyond his Bill Cosby albums.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/>

He caught a break in 1985 when he was asked to join the Broadway show Sugar Babies (musical) Sugar Babies with Mickey Rooney and Ann Miller, replacing an outgoing variety act. For the naive and devoutly-raised Dunham, Broadway was a new world filled with beautiful showgirls and crusty stagehands, and his first taste of entertainment industry egos came when Rooney called Dunham into his dressing room, and told him he was there for one reason alone: so that Rooney could change his costumes.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/> He performed at the Westbury Music Fair on Long Island. These early experiences, in which he used characters like José Jalapeño on a Stick, taught him the value of modifying his act regionally, as the jalapeño jokes that worked well in Texas were not as well received by audiences in Long Island. After graduating from Baylor University in 1986,<ref name=Rotorway/> he continued honing his act in comedy clubs in the Southwest with new characters such as Peanut and José Jalapeño, but struggled against the perception he relates from fellow comedians that he was not a true comedian because he relied on props.

His experience at Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs) Catch a Rising Star in New York City served as a bitter confirmation of where ventriloquists stood in the comedic food chain, as the emcee at that club gave Dunham little respect. According to Dunham, after he arrived at the club in the evening and informed the emcee that he was a ventriloquist, the emcee reacted with derision, telling Dunham that he would be given a late time slot, and after that time slot came and passed, kept postponing Dunhams stage time until Dunham left the club.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/>

By the end of 1988, Dunham felt his career went as far as it could go in Texas, and he moved to Los Angeles, California,<ref name=OfficialBio/><ref name=BirthOfADummy/> never having, as he has commented, "a real job",<ref name=ComCenBio/> much to the concern of his parents, who assumed he would relegate his act to local venues such as church groups. When he first arrived in Los Angeles, the comedy in his act bombed. Dunham attributes this initial reaction to his underdeveloped comedy, explaining that while the characters personalities were developed at that point, his jokes were not. In addition to this, the comedy world was not welcoming to ventriloquists, and his manager, Judi Brown-Marmel, did not use the word "ventriloquist" when finding bookings for him, choosing to present him as a comedy duo. After Dunham became friends with Mike Lacey, owner of The Comedy & Magic Club in Hermosa Beach, Lacey gave Dunham a steady slot at the club, where Dunham sharpened his act by observing the techniques of comedians like Jerry Seinfeld, and taking the advice of colleague Bill Engvall, moving away from his Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings G-Rated material toward edgier, more adult themes.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/>

===The Tonight Show===
At the end of 1988, Dunham was told by James McCawley, a talent booker for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, that Dunham would be given a spot on the coveted program. Though the 26-year-old Dunham was elated that his 10-year goal was arriving two years early, McCawley later cancelled Dunhams appearance after attending, with Roseanne Barr, a public performance of Dunhams the day before Dunhams scheduled Tonight Show taping. McCawley informed Dunham on the day of the scheduled taping that he had been wrong in his initial assessment of Dunham, whom he now said was not ready for The Tonight Show. Dunham continued to tighten his act in Los Angeles clubs, performing the same six-minute segment with Peanut a total of nine times for McCawley over the next few months. Finally at the Ice-House in Pasadena, California Pasadena in April 1990, after Dunham did the same segment, McCawley informed Dunham that he would finally get his Tonight Show appearance. Dunham and Peanut appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson on April 6, 1990, alongside guests Bob Hope and B.B. King.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/> Following his bit, he was invited to sit on Johnny Carsons couch, a mark of approval on Carsons show.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/> Upon sitting down next to Carsons desk, Dunham pulled out Walter, who told Carson sidekick Ed McMahon, American Family Publishers "Stop sending me all your damn mail." At the time, Dunham saw his Tonight Show appearance as his big break, but was frustrated at his parents initial disapproval over Walters use of the words "hell" and "damn",<ref name=BirthOfADummy/> and he would toil in obscurity for another twelve years, continuing his stand up at venues such as The Improv chain, and appearing in small roles on TV.<ref name=TomMorris/> One of these was a 1996 episode of Ellen (TV series) Ellen, in which he appeared with Walter.<ref name=NewYorkTimes/> Dunham also appeared with Walter in a TV commercial for The Hertz Corporation Hertz.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thsS58Yoz6o&feature=related Video of the Jeff Dunhams Hertz commercial].</ref> Dunham would appear on The Tonight Show a total of four times, as well as similar TV venues such as Hot Country Nights, appearing in one segment with Reba McEntire. This exposure helped make Dunham a large theater headliner, a rare accomplishment for a ventriloquist, but by the mid-1990s, his television appearances had dwindled, and with them, so did his stage audiences.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/>

Dunham moved back to clubs, more than 200 appearances a year. To maintain a connection with his fan base, he would use question cards that he had audiences fill out for his performances to build a database, which was tailor-made for the burgeoning World Wide Web. Though he was voted Funniest Male Standup at the American Comedy Awards in 1998, his club work kept him away from his wife and daughters between two and three weeks each month, which put a strain on his marriage, and made paying bills for his expanded family difficult. By 2002, Dunham was hoping to obtain more TV work to raise his profile and ease his standup schedule. Such exposure was elusive until a successful appearance on The Best Damn Sports Show Period, where Dunham and Walter made jokes at the expense of co-hosts Tom Arnold (actor) Tom Arnold, Michael Irvin, John Salley and John Kruk, generating laughter from them, and giving Dunham much-needed exposure. In 2003, Dunham was the frontrunner to replace Jimmy Kimmel on Fox NFL Sunday, but hosts Howie Long and Terry Bradshaw were not amenable to the idea of being upstaged by a puppet, and, as Dunham tells it, did not provide a welcoming atmosphere to Dunham, nor allow him to speak much during his appearance.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/>

===First Comedy Central specials===
On July 18, 2003, Dunham appeared on Comedy Central Presents, his first solo appearance on Comedy Central. During his half hour piece, he showcased José Jalapeño on a Stick, Walter, an early version of Melvin the Superhero Guy and Peanut, whom Dunham had begun to merchandise into a line of dolls. The appearance was successful, but Comedy Central resisted giving Dunham more airtime, feeling that he was not a good fit for them.<ref name=NewYorkTimes/> By 2005 Dunham decided to gamble on financing his own comedy DVD, Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself, which was taped in Santa Ana, California.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/> Dunhams manager, Judi Brown-Marmel, lobbied the network to air it, pointing to Dunhams drawing power and merchandising profits, and arguing that the network needed more diverse content. Surprised by the high ratings of the first Blue Collar Comics concert movie that same year, the network began to reconsider its brand. In late 2006, Comedy Central aired Arguing with Myself, drawing two million viewers when it aired,<ref name=NewYorkTimes/> and selling two million DVDs.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/>

In 2007, Dunham appeared as The Amazing Ken with José Jalapeño on a Stick in the Larry the Cable Guy feature film Delta Farce.
His second special, Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity, was taped at the Warner Theatre (Washington, D.C.) Warner Theater in Washington, D.C. that same year. It served not only to cement Dunhams stardom, but to introduce his most controversial character, Achmed the Dead Terrorist, which became a viral Internet sensation. A clip of Achmed from Insanity attracted over 140 million hits on YouTube,<ref name=BirthOfADummy/> making it the ninth most watched clip on that website as of October 2009.<ref name=NewYorkTimes/>

By 2008, Dunhams characters had crossed language barriers, with his specials dubbed for audiences in various countries such as France, and Dunham attracting requests for performances in South Africa, Australia, Norway, Denmark, China, and the Middle East.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/> Jeff Dunhams Very Special Christmas Special was taped at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin that same year, and premiered on Comedy Central on November 16, 2008, watched by 6.6 million people.<ref name=NewYorkTimes/> It became available on DVD and Blu-ray Disc Blu-ray on November 18, 2008.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001DWNUIS Jeff Dunhams Very Special Christmas Special].

In September 2008, his career reached new heights as he began performing in arenas filled with tens of thousands of people. Dunham was somewhat wary of such large venues, but adapted by adjusting the timing of his often rapid exchanges with the puppets so that audience members farthest from the stage could have time to react.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/>

In addition to his comedy specials, Dunham also released his first music album, Dont Come Home for Christmas, on November 4, 2008.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001DXD57S Dont Come Home for Christmas]. Amazon.com; retrieved November 23, 2011.</ref> It contains original Christmas songs as well as a parody of "Jingle Bells" by Achmed entitled "Jingle Bombs". All the songs, with the exception of "Jingle Bombs", were written and accompanied by Brian Haner, who joined Dunhams act as "Guitar Guy". His first onscreen appearance was in Jeff Dunhams Very Special Christmas Special.{{citation needed date=May 2014}}

In 2008, a TV commercial for a ringtone which featured Dunhams character Achmed the Dead Terrorist (see Characters below) was banned by the South African Advertising Standards Authority (South Africa) Advertising Standards Authority after a complaint was filed by a citizen stating that the ad was offensive to Muslims, and portrayed all Muslims as terrorists. Dunham responded that "Achmed makes it clear in my act that he is not Muslim." However, the ASA noted that the name Achmed was of Arab origin and was one of the names of Muhammad. Dunham responded, "Ive skewered whites, blacks, Hispanics, Christians, Jews, Muslims, gays, straights, rednecks, addicts, the elderly, and my wife. As a standup comic, it is my job to make the majority of people laugh, and I believe that comedy is the last true form of free speech ...

==Books==
In 2003, BRASMA Publications released Dear Walter, a collection of questions asked of Dunhams fictional curmudgeon at live performances, authored by Dunham and Walter Cummings.<ref>{{cite book  last=Dunham  first=Jeff  isbn=0970132301  title=Dear Walter}}</ref> His autobiography, All By My Selves: Walter, Peanut, Achmed and Me, was published by Dutton in November 2010.<ref name=AllByMySelves/>

==Characters==

===Walter===
{{distinguish Walter (Muppet)}}
File:Walter (Jeff Dunham Character, 2007).jpg thumb Dunham with Walter, in a shot from a 2007 performance

Walter is a retired, grumpy old man with arms always crossed in discontent. Dunham was inspired to create Walter when he watched Bette Daviss final appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, giving her honest, unfiltered candor to Walter, and patterning Walters frown on Dunhams own.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/> He has a brash, negative and often sarcastic view on todays world. He is a Vietnam War veteran and a former welder, and "doesnt give a damn" about anyone, especially his own wife and certain audience members. Walter appeared in all four Comedy Central specials. Hes been married for several decades. When Dunham asks him if he remembers the happiest moment of his life after Walter tells him he has been married for forty-six years, Walter responds, "Forty-seven years ago!" Dunham created the Walter puppet himself, including both the initial sculpture and the silicone mold, though he eventually began using professional effects companies for the latter stages with his subsequent puppets.<ref name=SparkDVD>This is mentioned in an extra on the Spark of Insanity DVD.</ref>

In Relative Disaster its revealed that Walter might be Jeffs biological father.

===Peanut===
Peanut is a hyperactive,<ref name=NewYorkTimes/> purple-skinned "woozle"<ref>{{cite av media url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWThRmRW6GE title=YouTube publisher=}}</ref> with white fur covering most of his body, a tuft of green hair on the top of his head, and one sneaker on his left foot. Dunham explains in Arguing with Myself that Peanut is from a small Micronesian island, and that they met in Florida. Peanuts humor is not based on a particular motif or stereotype, as those of the other characters, and he has been described as "the bad kid".<ref name=Time/> He often makes fun of Dunham, and torments and mocks José Jalapeño on a Stick. Touching upon his unusual appearance and personality, he asks Dunham in Arguing with Myself, after Dunham denies ever having done drugs, "Then how the hell did you come up with me?"

===José Jalapeño on a Stick===
José is a talking jalapeño pepper on a stick who wears a small sombrero. José, who speaks with a thick Spanish accent, is typically paired with Peanut, who often makes fun of José, uses appeals to Latino stereotypes when doing so, and makes fun of his being on a stick.<ref name="puppets"/> Although José was not Dunhams first puppet, it was the first that Dunham made himself.<ref>This is mentioned in the DVD Commentary of Arguing with Myself.</ref>

Dunham has not used José in any specials since "Minding the Monsters", although he was referenced by Walter in Relative Disaster.

===Bubba J===
Bubba J is a beer-drinking redneck that Dunham describes in Arguing with Myself and A Very Special Christmas Special as "white trash trailer park", and whom Dunham uses for humor centered on such stereotypes. To this end, he frequently does jokes involving Bubba Js love of drinking beer and NASCAR, and his low intelligence. Touching upon such stereotypes, Bubba mentions in Arguing with Myself that he met his wife at a family reunion, and remembers seeing her with a corn dog in one hand, a beer in another, and leaning against a ferris wheel, "making it tilt".<ref name="puppets"/> Although he does not appear onstage, Bubba has a prominent role as the backstage security guard in Controlled Chaos.

===Sweet Daddy Dee===
Dunham introduces Sweet Daddy Dee in Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself Arguing with Myself as his "new manager". He calls himself a "pimp", which he says stands for "Player In the Management Profession." According to Sweet Daddy, because he is a pimp, that makes Jeff the "Prostitution ho". When Dunham objects, Daddy Dee points out that Dunham makes people laugh and feel good for a living. When Dunham agrees that this is the case, Daddy Dee says, "You a ho." When Dunham asks what he would say if he told him that he was a comedian only because he enjoyed it, Daddy Dee responds, "You a dumb ho."<ref name="puppets">{{cite web title=Jeff Dunham and his puppets publisher=UnikNotions url=http://uniknotions.com/fullarticle.php?articlenum=100 accessdate=4 May 2014 archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203010854/http://uniknotions.com/fullarticle.php?articlenum=100 archive-date=3 February 2016 dead-url=yes df=dmy-all}}</ref> Much unlike Bubba J, he hates NASCAR. Sweet Daddys headstone is featured in the beginning of the special Minding the Monsters. As revealed in the DVD release, this signifies that he will no longer be used; however, he has reappeared in some videos on Jeffs YouTube channel, he was also referenced in Relative Disaster.{{citation needed date=May 2014}}

===Melvin the Superhero Guy===
Melvin wears a blue superhero costume, and is used to poke fun at superheroes. When asked about his superhuman powers, he indicates that he has X-ray vision, adding, "I love looking at boobies!" He appears to have no other powers, however: When Dunham asks how far he can fly, he responds, "How far can you throw me?", and when asked if he can stop a bullet like Superman, he responds, "Yeah. Once". Dunham portrays Melvin as unimpressed with other superheroes: When told Superman can leap tall buildings in a single bound, Melvin dismisses him as a "showoff," arguing that he can simply walk around them, observes that Aquaman has the same powers as SpongeBob SquarePants (character) SpongeBob SquarePants, asserts that the Flash (comics) Flashs speedster (comics) super speed is derived from methamphetamine, that the Hulk (comics) Hulks vaunted ability to get stronger as he gets angrier merely mirrors "every white trash guy on Cops (TV series) COPS," and makes innuendo about the Ephebophilia questionable relationship between Batman and the underage Robin (comics) Robin. Melvins first onscreen appearance was in the July 2003 Comedy Central Presents episode, in which he had small, black, beady eyes. By his next appearance, in Spark of Insanity, he had been modified to have large, blue, strabismus crossed eyes. He has an enormous nose, which he claims is his symbol, and whose similarity in shape to that of a penis is alluded to in the act. Dunham sculpted the current version of Melvins head himself, and hired an effects company called Renegade Effects Groups to create the rubber mold and complete the puppet, before then installing the mechanics himself.<ref name=SparkDVD/> Melvins headstone is featured in the beginning of the special Minding the Monsters. As revealed in the DVD release, this signifies that he will no longer be used. {{citation needed date=May 2014}}

===Achmed the Dead Terrorist===
Achmed is the skeletal corpse of an incompetent suicide bomber, whom Dunham uses to satirize the contemporary issue of terrorism. He is known for yelling, "Silence! I keel you!" to Dunham and people laughing in the audience. Achmed first appeared in Spark of Insanity, and has since appeared in every Dunham special since then. In Spark of Insanity the audience learns several things about Achmed. When Dunham says that Achmed must be dead because hes a skeleton, Achmed responds, "Monty Python and the Holy Grail Its a flesh wound." When Dunham inquires as to how he died, Achmed explains his incompetence with explosives, while also casting aspersions on Dunhams sexual prowess by saying that they both suffer from "Premature ejaculation premature detonation". Although he frequently mentions working for Osama Bin Laden, Achmed denies being a Muslim and says "Look at my ass! It says Made in China!" He says he is afraid of Walter, partially because hes "one mean son of a bitch" and finds Walters flatulence to be more potent than Saddam Husseins Halabja poison gas attack mustard gas. In Jeff Dunhams Very Special Christmas Special Very Special Christmas Special, he sings a song called "Jingle Bombs".

By June 2009, the sketch in which Dunham introduced Achmed has amassed nearly 200 million views.<ref name=Time/><ref name=Purcell>"Achmed the dead terrorist and humor in popular geopolitics" by Darren Purcell, Melissa Scott Brown and Mahmut Gokmen, GeoJournal, January 31, 2009.</ref> The large, round, articulated eyes of puppets such as Achmed and Achmed Junior are constructed by the same effects artist who created the dinosaur eyes for the Jurassic Park (film) Jurassic Park films.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/> The characters popularity lead to a starring role in Achmed Saves America, an animated film that premiered on Country Music Television in March 2014. In the film, which depicts the mishap that led to the characters skeletonization, Achmed himself is in an American town called Americaville, which he plots to blow up, before developing an affinity for American culture.<ref name=Zap2it/><ref>[http://www.achmedsavesamerica.com ACHMED SAVES AMERICA – Official Trailer], AchmedSavesAmerica.com; retrieved March 20, 2014.</ref>

===Little Jeff===
Little Jeff is a miniature version of Dunham himself, usually dressed in the same clothes Dunham wears during each show. He appeared in Jeff Dunham: Controlled Chaos as a puppet that Peanut used when trying to do ventriloquism like Dunham. Peanut named the doll "Little Ugly Ass-Jeff", and uses him to insult Dunham. In Unhinged in Hollywood, Dunham himself puppeteers him, and gives him different voice than he did in his past performances.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.jeffdunham.com/characters/little-jeff/ title=Little Jeff - Jeff Dunham publisher=}}</ref>

===Diane===
Diane first appeared with Dunham in the 2010 film Dinner for Schmucks as "Debbie", his characters "wife". She made her stand-up debut in Dunhams Identity Crisis Tour 2010.<ref>[http://campaigns.eaudiencemarketing.com/emails/AhI17386Ykrr Jeff Dunhams Identity Crisis Tour]; accessed 28 September 2010.</ref>

===Achmed Junior===
Achmed Junior is the estranged son of Achmed. He was designed by Mad (magazine) Mad magazine illustrator Tom Richmond (illustrator) Tom Richmond.<ref name=BirthOfADummy/> He first appeared during the Identity Crisis Tour 2010, and made his first onscreen appearance in Dunhams fourth special, Jeff Dunham: Controlled Chaos. Like his father, Achmed Junior is the victim of a bomb, which resulted in the destruction of the half of his face and body. He speaks with a British accent because he was raised in Britain after the accident. Much to his fathers consternation, he expresses an attraction to Dunhams male stage hand, Marnell, who constantly came on stage because Achmed kept losing balance on the stand and eventually Marnell brought duct tape. He does not wish to be a suicide bomber.<ref>Dunham, Jeff (). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL357BrwK7c Jeff Dunham: Controlled Chaos]. YouTube (2011), 7:43 to 8:09.</ref>

===Seamus===
Seamus is Dunhams newest adopted addition to his family. He is an Irish infant, but is already well-versed in drinking. He is introduced in the Netflix special Relative Disaster.

===Others===
Other characters that Dunham has voiced include a miniature puppet of Peanuts, and an unseen Mezcal worm worm inside a bottle of tequila, both of which he has used, for example, in his appearance on A&E Television Networks A&Es An Evening at The Improv.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDsjr7O6_T0&feature=related Video of Dunham].

In addition to building the dummies he uses in his act, Dunham also restores antique ones as a hobby, such as The Umpire, a {{convert 6 ft m adj=mid -tall}} mechanized dummy built in 1941 to work the plate at a girls softball game, which went unused and packed away for 50 years before Dunham acquired it in early 2008.<ref name=NewYorkTimes/>
