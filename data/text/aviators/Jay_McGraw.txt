==RumorFix==
In 2010 McGraw launched RumorFix, an anti-Tabloid journalism tabloid website that examines tabloid rumors and stories to verify whether or not they are factual.
If a story is deemed true, the website labels it as "Its True", with unconfirmed rumors marked as "Still a Rumor" and false rumors marked with "RumorFixed".
Mediaite commented that the site was very similar to Gossip Cop, a pre-existing website that also specialized in investigating whether or not celebrity rumors were true or false.
