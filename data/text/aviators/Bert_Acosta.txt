Bertrand Blanchard Acosta (January 1, 1895 &ndash; September 1, 1954) was a record-setting aviator. With Clarence D. Chamberlin they set an endurance record of 51 hours, 11 minutes, and 25 seconds in the air. He later flew in the Spanish Civil War in the Yankee Squadron.<ref>{{cite news  first=  last=  authorlink=  coauthors=  title=4 Americans in Spain to Fly for Madrid.

In 1915 he worked as a flying instructor. He went to Canada and worked as an instructor for the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service in Toronto. In 1917 he was appointed chief instructor, Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps at Hazelhurst Field, Long Island where he test flew early open-cockpit aircraft such as the Continental KB-1 over New York in below freezing conditions.<ref>{{cite journal magazine=Aviation title=Continental Pusher Biplane page=35 date=1 February 1918}}</ref>

Acosta married Mary Louise Brumley (1886–1962) in 1918 but they divorced in 1920.<ref>Mary Louise Brumley (1886&ndash;1962) born on July 27, 1886 in Norfolk Virginia, and she was a descendant of Henry Clay. She died in 1962. Ida Clay Baker was her mother. She married John Earl Pringell after the divorce from Bert.</ref> He won The Pulitzer Trophy Race in 1921 and the same year set an airspeed record of 176.9 miles an hour.<ref>[http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/apjinternational/apj-s/2trimes99/ashcroft.htm]</ref> In 1922 he served as a test pilot for the Stout Batwing Limousine, Stouts forerunner to the Ford Trimotor. In 1925 he was a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy and was living at 1 Winslow Court in Naugatuck, Connecticut. He married Helen Belmont Pearsoll, on August 3, 1921.  They eventually separated but never divorced.

==Endurance record==
In April 1927, he and Clarence D. Chamberlin set an endurance record of 51 hours, 11 minutes, and 25 seconds in the air. Time (magazine) Time magazine reported on April 25, 1927:<!--No renewal so the text is in the public domain-->
<blockquote>
Engineer Giuseppe M. Bellanca of the Columbia Aircraft Corporation had conditioned an Wright-Bellanca WB-2 Columbia elderly yellow-winged monoplane with one Wright motor, and scouted around for pilots. Lieut. Leigh Wade, round-the-world flyer, declined the invitation, saying Mr. Bellancas plans were too stunt-like, not scientific. Shrugging, Mr. Bellanca engaged Pilots Clarence Duncan Chamberlin and burly Bert Acosta, onetime auto speedster, to test his ships endurance. Up they put from Mitchel Field, Long Island, with 385 gallons of ethylated (high power) gasoline. All day they droned back and forth over suburbia, circled the Woolworth Building, hovered over Hadley Field, New Jersey, swung back to drop notes on Mitchel Field. All that starry night they wandered slowly around the sky, and all the next day, and through the next night, a muggy, cloudy one. Newsgatherers flew up alongside to shout unintelligible things through megaphones. Messrs. Acosta and Chamberlain were looking tired and oil-blobbed. They swallowed soup and sandwiches, caught catnaps on the mattressed fuel tank, while on and on they droned, almost lazily (about 80 m.p.h.) for they were cruising against time. Not for 51 hours, 11 minutes, 25 seconds, did they coast to earth, having broken the U.S. and worlds records for protracted flight. In the same time, conditions favoring, they could have flown from Manhattan to Vienna. They had covered 4,100 miles. To Paris it is 3,600 miles from Manhattan. Jubilant, Engineer Bellancas employers offered competitors a three-hour headstart in the race to Paris. The Bellanca monoplanes normal cruising speed is 110 m.p.h. She would require only some 35 hours to reach Paris—if she could stay up that long again.<ref>{{cite news  first=  last=  authorlink=  coauthors=  title=Paris Preliminaries  url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,730448,00.html  quote=Engineer Giuseppe M.

==Orteig Prize Attempt==
Columbia Aircraft Corp president Charles Levine planned on using Clarence Chamberlin or Bert Acosta as pilot with Lloyd W. Bertaud as copilot on their attempt at the Orteig prize in the Wright-Bellanca WB-2 Columbia. Levine bumped Bertaud from the copilot position, prompting an injunction preventing any Orteig record flight. Charles Lindbergh arrived on May 5, 1927. While Chamberlin waited for the injunction to be lifted, his other competition, Richard Evelyn Byrd Admiral Byrds team was repairing his Fokker C-2 Trimotor, the "America (C-2) America" after a practice run crash. On May 20–21, 1927, Lindbergh left Roosevelt Field, New York Roosevelt Field and crossing the Atlantic, while leaving the Columbia and Atlantic behind at the adjacent Curtiss Field.<ref>{{cite web title=Bellanca Aircraft  url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/GENERAL_AVIATION/bellanca/GA1.htm  accessdate=17 November 2010  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121085815/http://centennialofflight.gov/essay/GENERAL_AVIATION/bellanca/GA1.htm  archivedate=21 November 2010  df= }}</ref>

==Transatlantic flight==
On June 29, 1927, thirty-three days after Charles Lindberghs record setting transatlantic flight, Acosta flew from Roosevelt Field, New York Roosevelt Field on Long Island to France with Commander Richard E. Byrd, Lieutenant George O. Noville and Bernt Balchen aboard the America (C-2) America.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/America-NX206.htm  title=

During the flight, the (perhaps apocryphal) story was that Byrd had to hit Acosta over the head with a fire extinguisher or a flashlight when he got out of control from drinking during their flight.<ref name=natural>{{cite news  first=  last=  authorlink=  coauthors=  title=Pilots Pilot  url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,883487,00.html  quote=Long before anyone ever heard of Lindbergh, Chamberlin, Post or Earhart, one of aviations big names was Bert Acosta. Famed as a natural among pilots, he probably had a greater talent for flying than any man before or since. But like many another early barnstormer and stunter, he took to the fleshpots on earth as an offset to his work in the air. His life, consequently, became a rowdy romance in which brawls, jails and domestic entanglements were due to play a large part.  publisher=Time (magazine) Time  date= June 10, 1935  accessdate=2007-09-25 }}</ref>

==Bad Boy==
In 1928 Connecticut suspended his pilot license for trying to fly under the Whittemore Memorial Bridge in Naugatuck. According to local Naugatuck tradition, the wing span of his aircraft was much longer than the width of the center arch of the bridge. The flight may have been a publicity stunt, as there was an advertisement for Splitdorf Spark Plugs on the fuselage.

In 1929 he was fined $500 for low flying and stunting. When he failed to pay the fine, the Department of Commerce revoked his pilot license. He was arrested by Connecticut State troopers in 1930 for flying without a license.<ref name=natural/><ref>{{cite news  first=  last=  authorlink=  coauthors=  title=Bert Acosta Freed In Connecticut Case.

A new Terle Sportplane was being tested at Roosevelt Field in New York in 1931, but the Civil Aeronautics Administration (United States) CAA did not register it as a licensed aircraft. The aircraft was later test flown by Acosta, who found it perfect for his use since he was currently grounded from flying licensed aircraft from a previous infraction. After performing aerobatics with the aircraft to a large crowd, Acosta and Terle planned to produce the aircraft together as the "Acosterle Wild Cet". The aircraft was test flown for two years, but could not meet certification requirements.<ref>{{cite journal title=none magazine=Experimenter date=May 1957}}</ref>

In 1931 with Captain Lisandro Garay of the Honduran Air Force he planned to fly from New York to Honduras . They left from Floyd Bennett Field and loaded their Bellanca monoplane with 360 gallons of gasoline to make a test flight, Bert disappeared and never made the flight.<ref>{{cite news  first=  last=  authorlink=  coauthors=  title=Biggests  url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,742123,00.html  quote=Captain Lisandro Garay of the Honduran Air Force last week at Floyd Bennett Field loaded a Bellanca monoplane with 360 gallons [of] gasoline and Bert Acosta to make a test flight from New York to Honduras.
