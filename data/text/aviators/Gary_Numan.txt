Gary Anthony James Webb (born 8 March 1958), known professionally as Gary Numan, is an English singer, songwriter, composer, musician and record producer. Born in Hammersmith, West London, he first entered the music industry as lead singer of the New wave music new wave band Tubeway Army. After releasing two albums with the band, Numan released his debut solo album The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album) The Pleasure Principle in 1979.

With number-one singles "Are "Friends" Electric? Are Friends Electric?" and "Cars (song) Cars", Numan achieved his peak of mainstream popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but maintains a cult following.<ref>{{cite web last=Huey first=Steve title=Gary Numan: Artist Biography url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gary-numan-mn0000183858/biography publisher=AllMusic accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref> His signature sound consists of heavy synthesiser Hook (music) hooks fed through guitar Effects unit effects pedals, and he is considered a pioneer of commercial electronic music.<ref name="bbc-review1">{{cite web last=Conmy first=Mick title=Gary Numan review url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/oxford/content/articles/2008/03/17/numan_feature.shtml publisher=BBC Online date=17 March 2008 accessdate=4 July 2008}}</ref><ref name="flux">{{cite web last=Rik title=Review, Gary Numans "Hybrid" url=http://www.fluxeuropa.com/gary_numan-hybrid.htm publisher=Fluxeuropa date=23 February 2003 accessdate=31 January 2009 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205184719/http://www.fluxeuropa.com/gary_numan-hybrid.htm archivedate=5 February 2009 df=dmy-all}}</ref> Numan is also known for his distinctive voice and Androgyny androgynous "android" persona.<ref name=Lester /> In 2017 he received an Ivor Novello Awards Ivor Novello Award, the Inspiration Award, from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.

==Early life==
Gary Anthony James Webb was born on 8 March 1958 in Hammersmith, West London (sub region) West London, the son of a British Airways bus driver based at Heathrow Airport.<ref name="Rees Crampton 1991 p=366">{{cite book last1=Rees first1=Dafydd last2=Crampton first2=Luke title=Rock Movers and Shakers: An A to Z of the People Who Made Rock Happen date=1991 publisher=ABC-CLIO isbn=978-0874366617 page=366}}</ref> He was educated at Town Farm Junior School in Stanwell Stanwell, Surrey, Ashford, Surrey Ashford County Grammar School, then Upton Court Grammar School Slough Grammar School in Berkshire,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.80smusiclyrics.com/artists/garynuman.htm  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011228001032/http://www.80smusiclyrics.com/artists/garynuman.htm  dead-url=yes  archive-date=28 December 2001  title=Gary Numan: Best Music from the 1980s  publisher=80smusiclyrics.com  date=8 March 1958  accessdate=15 May 2011  df= }} {{unreliable source? date=March 2016}}</ref> followed by Brooklands Technical College in Surrey. He joined the Air Training Corps as a teenager. He then briefly held various jobs including forklift truck driver, air conditioning ventilator fitter, and accounts clerk.

When Numan was 15 years old, his father bought him a Gibson Les Paul, which he regards as his most treasured possession.<ref name=Webber>{{cite web last=Webber first=Richard title=Gary Numan: I had so much cash, all I wanted to do was spend url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/9028387/Gary-Numan-I-had-so-much-cash-all-I-wanted-to-do-was-spend.html publisher=The Telegraph accessdate=24 July 2012 date=22 January 2012}}</ref> He played in various bands, including Mean Street and the Lasers, before forming Tubeway Army with his uncle, Jess Lidyard, and Paul Gardiner.

==Career==

===1970s===

====Tubeway Army====
Numan came to prominence at the end of the 1970s as lead singer, songwriter, and record producer for Tubeway Army. After recording an albums worth of punk rock punk-influenced Demo (music) demo tapes (released in 1984 as The Plan (Tubeway Army album) The Plan), he was signed by Beggars Banquet Records in 1978 and quickly released two singles, "Thats Too Bad" and "Bombers (Gary Numan song) Bombers", neither of which charted.

A self-titled, New wave music new wave-oriented Tubeway Army (album) debut album later that same year sold out its limited run and introduced Numans fascination with dystopian science fiction<ref name=Europopmusic>{{cite web title=Part 6: "Are friends electric? " url=http://www.europopmusic.eu/Newsletters/History_electronic_music_part_6.html work=The history of electronic music within European pop?" publisher=Europopmusic accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> and synthesisers. Tubeway Armys third single, the dark-themed and slow-paced "Down in the Park" (1979), also failed to chart, but it would prove to be one of Numans most enduring and oft-covered songs. It was featured with other contemporary hits on the soundtrack for the 1980 film Times Square (film) Times Square, and a live version of the song can be seen in the 1982 film Urgh! A Music War. Following exposure in a television advertisement for Lee Cooper jeans with the jingle "Dont Be a Dummy",<ref name=Europopmusic /> Tubeway Army released the single "Are "Friends" Electric? Are Friends Electric?" in May 1979. The single took seven weeks before finally reaching No.&nbsp;1 at the end of June; its parent album Replicas (album) Replicas simultaneously reached No.&nbsp;1.

====As Gary Numan====
A few months later Numan found success in the charts on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean with "Cars (song) Cars", which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in the UK in 1979, No.&nbsp;1 in Canada<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.0189a&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=ccntousk30frf6h4jsn237nm12 title=Item Display – RPM – Library and Archives Canada publisher=Collectionscanada.gc.ca accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> and No.&nbsp;9 in the U.S. in 1980. "Cars" and the 1979 album The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album) The Pleasure Principle were both released under Numans own stage name. The album reached number-one in the UK, and a sell-out tour (The Touring Principle) followed; the Concert film concert video it spawned is often cited as the first full-length commercial music video release.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.on-this-day.com/onthisday/thedays/music/apr14.htm title=Music history for April 14 from publisher=On-This-Day.com date= accessdate=14 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1997/04.21/revnuman.html title=Review: Gary Numan/Tubeway Army, Premier Hits - Derek Langsford publisher=Westnet.com date= accessdate=14 October 2015 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304223724/http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1997/04.21/revnuman.html archivedate=4 March 2016 df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Pleasure Principle was a rock album with no guitars; instead, Numan used synthesisers fed through guitar effects pedals to achieve a distorted, phased, metallic tone. A second single from the album, "Complex (song) Complex", made it to No.&nbsp;6 on the UK Singles Chart.

====Personality and style====
Around this time, Numan also developed his style. According to Numan, this was an unintentional result of acne; before an appearance on Top of the Pops, he had "spots everywhere, so they slapped about half an inch of white make-up on me before Id even walked in the door. And my eyes were like pissholes in the snow, so they put black on there. My so-called image fell into place an hour before going on the show".<ref name=Lester/> His "wooden" stage presence was, in his words, a result of extreme self-consciousness and lack of "showmanship" and often referred to as being "like an Android (robot) android".<ref name=Lester /> During this period, Numan generated an army of fans calling themselves "Numanoids", providing him with a fanbase which maintained their support through the latter half of the 1980s, when his fortunes began to fall precipitously.<ref name=Lester /><ref name="Discogs.com">{{cite web url=http://www.discogs.com/Gary-Numan-Dance/release/1212792 title=Gary Numan - Dance (Vinyl, LP, Album) publisher=Discogs.com date= accessdate=14 October 2015}}</ref>

He later said that he "... got really hung up with this whole thing of not feeling, being cold about everything, not letting emotions get to you, or presenting a front of not feeling".<ref name=Lester>{{cite web author=Paul Lester url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/03/gary-numan-little-boots-feature title=When Gary Numan met Little Boots date=3 December 2009 work=The Guardian location=UK accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref>

===1980s===
File:Gary Numan playing.jpg thumb 150px right Numan performing live, February 1980In 1980, Numan topped the album charts for a third time with Telekon, with the singles "We Are Glass", "I Die: You Die" released prior to the album reaching No.&nbsp;5 and No.&nbsp;6. "This Wreckage" taken from the album in December also entered the Top 20. Telekon, the final studio album that Numan retrospectively termed the "Machine" section of his career,<ref>Gary Numan (1981). Living Ornaments 79/80: LP Liner notes</ref> reintroduced guitars to Numans music and featured a wider range of synthesisers. The same year he embarked on his second major tour ("The Teletour") with an even more elaborate stage show than the Touring Principle the previous year. He announced his retirement from touring with a series of sell-out concerts at Wembley Arena in April 1981, supported by experimental musician Nash the Slash and Shock (troupe) Shock, a rock/mime/burlesque troupe whose members included Barbie Wilde, Tik and Tok, and Carole Caplin. A live two album set from the 1979 and 1980 tours released at this time reached No.&nbsp;2 in the charts. Both albums, also individually released as Living Ornaments 79 and Living Ornaments 80 also charted. The decision to retire would be short-lived.

Departing from the pure electropop that he had been associated with, Numan began experimenting with jazz, funk, and ethereal, rhythmic pop. His first album after his 1981 farewell concerts was Dance (Gary Numan album) Dance (1981). The album charted as high as No.&nbsp;3 on the UK Albums Chart UK charts, with an eight-week chart run and produced one hit single ("Shes Got Claws") reaching No.&nbsp;6.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/she%27s%20got%20claws/ title=Shes Got Claws {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company last= first= date= website= publisher= access-date=2017-01-09}}</ref> The album featured several distinguished guest players; Mick Karn (bass guitar; saxophone) and Rob Dean (guitar) of Japan (band) Japan, Roger Mason (musician) Roger Mason (keyboards) of Models (band) Models, and Roger Taylor (Queen drummer) Roger Taylor (drums) of Queen (band) Queen.<ref name="Discogs.com"/>

With his former backing band, Chris Payne (keyboards; viola), Russell Bell (guitar), and Ced Sharpley (drums) now reformed as Dramatis, Numan contributed vocals to the minor hit "Love Needs No Disguise" from the album For Future Reference and lent vocals to the first single release by his long-term bassist Paul Gardiner, "Stormtrooper in Drag", which also made the charts. However, Numans career had begun to experience a gradual decline, and he was eclipsed initially by acts such as Adam Ant, and later by the Human League, Duran Duran, and Depeche Mode. Each album also saw a new "image", none of which captured the publics imagination to nearly the same extent as the lonely android of 1979.<ref name=Lester />

The album I, Assassin (1982) fared less well than Dance. Despite producing one Top 10 and two Top 20 singles, the album peaked at No.&nbsp;8 with a six-week chart run.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/i,%20assassin/ title=I, Assassin {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company last= first= date= website= publisher= access-date=2017-01-09}}</ref> Numan supported the album with a concert tour in America in late 1982 (where at the time he was living as a tax exile).{{Citation needed date=April 2014}}

Warriors (Gary Numan album) Warriors (1983) further developed Numans jazz-influenced style and featured contributions from avant-garde music avant-garde musician Bill Nelson (musician) Bill Nelson (who fell out with Numan during recording and chose to be uncredited as the albums co-producer), and saxophonist Dick Morrissey (who would play on most of Numans albums until 1991).{{Citation needed date=April 2014}} The album peaked at No.&nbsp;12, produced two hit singles including the Top 20 title-track and, like I, Assassin, spent six weeks in the charts. Warriors was the last album Numan recorded for Beggars Banquet Records, and was supported by a 40-date UK tour (again with support from robotic mime and music duo Tik and Tok).{{Citation needed date=April 2014}}

Numan subsequently issued a series of albums and singles on his own record label, Numa. The first album released on Numa, 1984s Berserker (Gary Numan album) Berserker was also notable for being Numans first foray into music computers/Sampler (musical instrument) samplers, in this case the Palm Products GmbH PPG Wave. The album was accompanied by a new blue-and-white visual image (including Numan himself with blue hair), a tour, a live album/video/EP, and the title track reached the UK Top 40 when released as a single. Despite this, the album divided critics and fans and commercially it was Numans least successful release to that point.

Numans next album, The Fury (album) The Fury (1985), charted slightly higher than Berserker breaking the Top 30. Again, the album heralded a change of image, this time featuring Numan in a white suit and red bow tie. Four singles were released from the album, all reaching the UK Top 50.{{Citation needed date=April 2014}}

Collaborations with Bill Sharpe (musician) Bill Sharpe of Shakatak as Sharpe & Numan helped little, though two singles that the duo recorded did see chart action: "Change Your Mind (Sharpe & Numan song) Change Your Mind", reached No.&nbsp;17 in 1985, and "No More Lies" reached No.&nbsp;35 in 1988. In 1987, Numan performed vocals for three singles by Radio Heart, a project of brothers Hugh and David Nicholson, formerly of Marmalade_(band) Marmalade and Blue (Scottish band) Blue, which charted with varying success ("Radio Heart" #35 UK, "London Times" #48, "All Across The Nation" #81).<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/24040/radio-heart-featuring-gary-numan/ title=Radio Heart {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company last= first= date= website= publisher= access-date=2018-06-08}}</ref> An album was also released, credited to "Radio Heart featuring Gary Numan" although Numan only appeared on three tracks, but failed to chart. Also in 1987, Numans old label Beggars Banquet released the best-of compilation "Exhibition", which reached #43 on the UK albums chart<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/exhibition/ title=Exhibition {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company last= first= date= website= publisher= access-date=2018-06-08}}</ref>, and a remix of "Cars". The remix, titled "Cars (E Reg Model)" charted at #16, Numans final Top 20 hit until the 1996 rerelease of the same song.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/cars/ title=Cars {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company last= first= date= website= publisher= access-date=2018-06-08}}</ref> Numa Records, which had been launched in a flurry of idealistic excitement, folded after the release of Numans 1986 album Strange Charm, though the album did contain two Top 30 hits (Numans highest singles chart placings since 1983).{{Citation needed date=April 2014}} In addition to Numa Records commercial failure, Numans own fortune amassed since the late 1970s, which he estimated at £4.5&nbsp;million, was drained. Numan then signed to I.R.S. Records though his final studio album of the 1980s, Metal Rhythm (1988), also sold relatively poorly. For its American release, the record label changed the albums title to New Anger after the albums lead single, changed the album colour from black to blue, and remixed several of its tracks against Numans wishes. In 1989, the Sharpe & Numan album Automatic (Sharpe & Numan album) Automatic was released through Polydor Records, though this too failed to garner much commercial success, briefly entering the charts.{{Citation needed date=April 2014}}

===1990s===
In 1991, Numan ventured into film-scoring by co-composing the music for The Unborn with Michael R. Smith (the score was later released as an instrumental album in 1995, Human). After Outland (Gary Numan album) Outland (1991), another critical and commercial disappointment and his second and last studio album with I.R.S., Numan reactivated Numa Records, under which he would release his next two albums. He supported Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (who had opened for him in 1979) on a 1993 arena tour. By 1994, Numan decided to stop attempting to crack the pop market and concentrate instead on exploring more personal themes, including his vocal atheism. His future wife Gemma encouraged him to strip away the influences of the more recent years. Numan re-evaluated his career and veered toward a harsher, more industrial music industrial direction with his songwriting on the album Sacrifice (Gary Numan album) Sacrifice&mdash;for the first time he played almost all the instruments himself. The move was critically well-received, as Numans harder and darker sound emerged just as Numan-influenced bands like Nine Inch Nails were enjoying their first rush of fame.{{Citation needed date=November 2017}} The influence was two-way; Numan claimed that Nine Inch Nails song "Closer (Nine Inch Nails song) Closer" is his favourite hit single of all time, and influenced his music.{{Citation needed date=November 2017}} Sacrifice was the last album Numan made before shutting down Numa Records permanently. His next two studio albums, Exile (Gary Numan album) Exile (1997) and Pure (Gary Numan album) Pure (2000), were well received and significantly helped to restore his critical reputation. Numan toured the U.S. in support of Exile, his first stateside concerts since the early 1980s.<ref name=Lester /> Fear Factory produced a cover of "Cars" (featuring a prominent guest appearance by Numan himself) for the digipak version of their 1999 album, Obsolete (album) Obsolete.

Nine Inch Nails covered the song "Metal" on The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album) The Fragile remix album Things Falling Apart as did Afrika Bambaataa (with Numan himself) on the album Dark Matter Moving at the Speed of Light. "Cars" remains Numans most enduring song; it was a hit again in 1987 (remixed by Zeus B. Held) and 1996, in the latter case thanks to an appearance in an advert for Carling brewery. In 2000, DJ Armand Van Helden sampled the track and mixed it up in his single "Koochy" which conquered the dance floors. In 2002, English girl group the Sugababes scored a No.&nbsp;1 with "Freak Like Me#Sugababes version Freak Like Me"&mdash;a Mashup (music) mashup of Adina Howards "Freak Like Me" and "Are "Friends" Electric?" by Numans Tubeway Army.

File:Numan Replicas Tour 2008.jpg thumb left 225px Promoting the 2008 Replicas TourIn 2002, Numan enjoyed chart success once again with the single "Rip", reaching No.&nbsp;29 on the UK Singles Chart and in 2003 with the Gary Numan vs Rico single "Crazier (Gary Numan song) Crazier", which reached No.&nbsp;13 in the UK chart. Rico also worked on the remix album Hybrid which featured reworkings of older songs in a more contemporary industrial style as well as new material. Other artists and producers who contributed on these remixes included Curve (band) Curve, Flood (producer) Flood, Andy Gray (musician) Andy Gray, Alan Moulder, New Disease, and Sulpher. 2003 also saw Numan performing the vocals on a track named "Pray for You" on the Plump DJs album Eargasm. In 2004, Numan took control of his own business affairs again, launching the label Mortal Records and releasing a series of live DVDs. On 13 March 2006, Numans album, Jagged, was released. An album launch gig took place at The Forum, London on 18 March followed by UK, European and U.S. tours in support of the release. Numan also launched a Jagged website to showcase the new album, and made plans to have his 1981 farewell concert (previously released as Micromusic on VHS) issued on DVD by November 2006 as well as releasing the DVD version of the Jagged album launch gig. Numan undertook a Telekon Classic Album tour in the UK in December 2006.

In November 2007, Numan confirmed via his website that work on a new album, with the working title of Splinter, would be under way throughout 2008, after finishing an alternate version of Jagged (called Jagged Edge (Gary Numan album) Jagged Edge) and the CD of unreleased songs from his previous three albums (confirmed to be titled Dead Son Rising on 1 December 2008 via official mailing list message). He wrote that Splinter was likely to be released in early 2010.

===2010s===
Numan was set to perform a small number of American live dates in April 2010, including a Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival Coachella Festival appearance in California, but had to cancel because air travel in Europe was halted by the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull Icelandic volcanic ash cloud.
