Katherine Stinson (February 14, 1891 â€“ July 8, 1977) was a pioneering American aviator. She set flying records for distance, endurance, and aerobatic maneuvers, and taught at her familys aviation school.

==Biography==
She was born on February 14, 1891, in Fort Payne, Alabama.

She was the fourth woman in the United States to obtain a pilots certificate, which she earned on 24 July 1912, at the age of 21, while residing in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Initially, she planned to get her certificate and use money she earned from exhibition flying to pay for her music lessons. However, she found she liked flying so much that she gave up her piano career and decided to become an aviator. In January 1911, Stinson went to St. Louis to take flight lessons from Tony Jannus who only allowed her to fly as a passenger.<ref>{{cite book title=Women Who Fly author1=Lynn M. Homan  author2=Thomas Reilly  author3=Rosalie M. Shepherd }}</ref> She more than likely received some ground schooling and words of encouragement from Wilbur Wright himself as she is seen in his company about to refuel an aircraft in early 1912 but Wilbur died in May 1912 and before her flight training was begun or complete. She then took flying lessons from the well-known aviator Max Lillie, a pilot for the Wright Brothers, who initially refused to teach her because she was female. But she persuaded him to give her a trial lesson. She was so good that she flew alone after only four hours of instruction. A year after receiving her certificate, she began exhibition flying. On the exhibition circuit, she was known as the "Flying Schoolgirl." Katherine Stinson tried to tell newspaper reporters she was actually 21, not 16, but they refused to believe her.{{cn date=April 2018}}

After she received her certificate, Stinson and her family moved to San Antonio, Texas, an area with an ideal climate for flying. There she and her sister, Marjorie, began giving flying instruction at her familys aviation school in Texas. In March 1915 the famous Lincoln Beachey died in a crash at San Francisco and Stinson later acquired the rotary engine from his wrecked plane. On July 18, 1915, Stinson became the first woman to perform a aerobatic maneuver loop, at Cicero Field in Chicago, Illinois, and went on to perform this feat some 500 times without a single accident.<ref>{{cite journal magazine=AAHS Journal date=Winter 2003 title=Katherine Stinson Pioneering Aviatrix author=Lori Burrup}}</ref> She also was one of the first women authorized to carry airmail for the United States.

Stinsons flying inspired her brothers to form the Stinson Aircraft Company. All of her stunt flying was done in aircraft using the Wright control system, which uses two side-mounted levers for pitch and roll, with top mounted controls for throttle and yaw.
