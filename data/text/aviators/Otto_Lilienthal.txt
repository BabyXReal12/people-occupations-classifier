Otto Lilienthal (23 May 1848 &ndash; 10 August 1896) was a Germany German pioneer of aviation who became known as the  flying man<ref>e. g. [http://lilienthal-museum.museumnet.eu/content/15851 newspaper article] New York Herald August 12th, 1896</ref>. He was the first person to make well-documented, repeated, successful flights with Glider (aircraft) gliders.<ref>[http://www.dlr.de/dlr/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10280/385_read-16705/year-all/#/gallery/21944] DLR baut das erste Serien-Flugzeug der Welt nach, 2017. Retrieved: 3 March 2017.</ref> Newspapers and magazines published photographs of Lilienthal gliding, favorably influencing public and scientific opinion about the possibility of flying machines becoming practical. On 9 August 1896, his glider stalled and he was unable to regain control. Falling from about 15&nbsp;m (50&nbsp;ft), he broke his neck and died the next day, 10 August 1896.

==Early life==
Lilienthal was born on 23 May 1848 in Anklam, Pomerania Province (1815-1945) Pomerania Province, German kingdom of Prussia. According to his birth certificate,<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.carnetdevol.org/Otto/naissance.html  title=Archived copy  accessdate=2015-02-23  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200545/http://www.carnetdevol.org/Otto/naissance.html  archivedate=2015-09-23  df= }}</ref> his parents were Gustav and Caroline née Pohle. They belonged to the St. Nikolai evangelical church community in Anklam, where he later attended grammar school, and where he eventually studied the flight of birds with his brother Gustav (1849–1933).<ref>Encyclopedia of Transportation. New York: Rand-McNally, 1977.</ref> Fascinated by the idea of manned flight, Lilienthal and his brother made strap-on wings, but failed in their attempts to fly. He then attended the regional technical school in Potsdam for two years and trained at the Schwarzkopf Company before becoming a professional design engineer. He would later attend the Royal Technical Academy in Berlin.

In 1867, Lilienthal began experiments on the force of air in earnest, interrupted when he served in the Franco-Prussian War. As a staff engineer in various engineering companies, Lilienthal received his first patent for a mining machine. Five years later he founded his own company to make boilers and steam engines.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/edampf.htm  title=Archived copy  accessdate=2018-06-01}}</ref> Lilienthal published his famous book Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation in 1889.

Lilienthal was born to middle-class parents. They had eight children, but only three of them survived infancy: Otto, Gustav Lilienthal Gustav, and Marie.<ref>Anderson 2001, p. 156.</ref> The brothers worked together all their lives on technical, social, and cultural projects.

On 6 June 1878, Lilienthal married Agnes Fischer, daughter of a deputy. Music brought them together; she was trained in piano and voice while Lilienthal played the French horn and had a good tenor voice.<ref>Anderson 2001, p. 157.</ref> After marriage, they took up residence in Berlin and had four children: Otto, Anna, Fritz, and Frida.<ref name=FamilyTree>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Otto_Lilienthal.aspx "Otto Lilienthal."] Encyclopedia of World Biography, 2004.

Lilienthals greatest contribution was in the development of heavier-than-air flight. He made his flights from an artificial hill he built near Berlin and from natural hills, especially in the Rhinow region.

The filing of a U.S. Patent in 1894 by Lilienthal directed pilots to grip the "bar" for carrying and flying the hang glider.<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents?id=10xzAAAAEBAJ&dq=544816 "Flying-Machine Otto Lilienthal.] Patents. Retrieved: 16 November 2012.</ref> The A-frame of Percy Pilcher and Lilienthal echoes in todays control frame for hang gliders and ultralight trike ultralight aircraft.  Working in conjunction with his brother Gustav, Lilienthal made over 2,000 flights in gliders of his design starting in 1891 with his first glider version, the Derwitzer Glider Derwitzer, until his death in a gliding crash in 1896. His total flying time was five hours.<ref name=Wright>[http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/ewright.htm "From Lilienthal to the Wrights."] Otto Lilienthal Museum.  Retrieved: 8 January 2012.</ref>

At the beginning, in 1891, Lilienthal succeeded with jumps and flights covering a distance of about {{Convert 25 m ft}}. He could use the updraft of a 10&nbsp;m/s wind against a hill to remain stationary with respect to the ground, shouting to a photographer on the ground to manoeuvre into the best position for a photo. In 1893, in the Rhinow Hills, he was able to achieve flight distances as long as {{Convert 250 m ft}}.  This record remained unbeaten for him or anyone else at the time of his death.<ref name=Wright/>

Lilienthal did research in accurately describing the flight of birds, especially storks, and used Polar curve (aviation) polar diagrams for describing the aerodynamics of their wings. He made many experiments in an attempt to gather reliable aeronautical data.

File:Lilienthal hang glider.jpg thumb Restored 1894 glider displayed at the National Air and Space Museum. It is one of five surviving Lilienthal gliders in the world.
During his short flying career, Lilienthal developed a dozen models of monoplanes, ornithopter wing flapping aircraft and two biplanes.<ref name=Discovery>[http://www.yourdiscovery.com/flight/pioneers_of_flight/otto_lilienthal/index.shtml "Pioneers of Flight: Otto Lilienthal."] Discovery Channel. Retrieved: 8 January 2012.</ref> His gliders were carefully designed to distribute weight as evenly as possible to ensure a stable flight. Lilienthal controlled them by changing the center of gravity by shifting his body, much like modern hang gliders.  However they were difficult to maneuvre and had a tendency to pitch down, from which it was difficult to recover.  One reason for this was that he held the glider by his shoulders, rather than hanging from it like a modern hang glider.  Only his legs and lower body could be moved, which limited the amount of weight shift he could achieve.

Lilienthal made many attempts to improve stability with varying degrees of success.  These included making a biplane which halved the wing span for a given wing area, and by having a hinged tailplane that could move upwards to make the flare at the end of a flight easier.  He speculated that flapping wings of birds might be necessary and had begun work on such a powered aircraft.

While his lifelong pursuit was flight, Lilienthal was also an inventor and devised a small engine that worked on a system of tubular boilers.<ref>[http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/edampf.htm "Documentation of the only preserved Lilienthal engine"] Otto Lilienthal Museum. Retrieved: 12 February 2018.</ref> His engine was much safer than the other small engines of the time. This invention gave him the financial freedom to focus on aviation. His brother Gustav (1849–1933) was living in Australia at the time, and Lilienthal did not engage in aviation experiments until his brothers return in 1885.<ref>Runge and Lukasch: Erfinderleben.

==Worldwide notice==
{{unref section date=August 2018}}
Reports of Lilienthals flights spread in Germany and elsewhere, with photographs appearing in scientific and popular publications. Among those who photographed him were History of photography pioneers such as Ottomar Anschütz and American physicist Robert Williams Wood. He soon became known as the father of flight as he had successfully controlled a heavier-than-air aircraft in sustained flight.

Lilienthal was a member of the Verein zur Förderung der Luftschifffahrt, and regularly detailed his experiences in articles in its journal, the Zeitschrift für Luftschifffahrt und Physik der Atmosphäre, and in the popular weekly publication Prometheus. These were translated in the United States, France and Russia. Many people from around the world came to visit him, including Samuel Pierpont Langley from the United States, Russian Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky Nikolai Zhukovsky, Englishman Percy Pilcher and Austrian Wilhelm Kress. Zhukovsky wrote that Lilienthals flying machine was the most important invention in the aviation field. Lilienthal corresponded with many people, among them Octave Chanute, James Means, Alois Wolfmüller and other List of aviation pioneers flight pioneers.

==Final flight==
On 9 August 1896, Lilienthal went, as on previous weekends, to the Rhinow Hills. The day was very sunny and not too hot (about 20&nbsp;°C, or 68&nbsp;°F). The first flights were successful, reaching a distance of {{Convert 250 m ft}} in his normal glider. During the fourth flight Lilienthals glide pitched forward heading down quickly.  Lilienthal had previously had difficulty in recovering from this position because the glider relied on weight shift which was difficult to achieve when pointed at the ground.  His attempts failed and he fell from a height of about {{Convert 15 m ft}}, while still in the glider.<ref name=crash>Harsch, Viktor, Benny Bardrum and Petra Illig.

Retrieved: 7 January 2012.</ref>

Paul Beylich, Lilienthals glider mechanic, transported him by horse-drawn carriage to Stölln, where he was examined by a physician. Lilienthal had a fracture of the Cervical vertebra 3 third cervical vertebra and soon became unconscious. Later that day he was transported in a cargo train to Berlin Hauptbahnhof Lehrter train station in Berlin, and the next morning to the clinic of Ernst von Bergmann, one of the most famous and successful surgeons in Europe at the time. Lilienthal died there a few hours later (about 36 hours after the crash). 

There are differing accounts of Lilienthals last words. A popular account, inscribed on his tombstone, is "{{Lang de Opfer müssen gebracht werden!}}" ("Sacrifices must be made!"). The director of the Otto Lilienthal Museum doubts that these were his last words. <ref>Reichhardt, Tony.

==Legacy==
Lilienthals research was well known to the Wright brothers, and they credited him as a major inspiration for their decision to pursue manned flight. However, they abandoned his aeronautical data after two seasons of gliding and began using their own wind tunnel data.<ref>Crouch 1989, pp. 226–228.</ref>I

{{quote "Of all the men who attacked the flying problem in the 19th century, Otto Lilienthal was easily the most important.&nbsp;... It is true that attempts at gliding had been made hundreds of years before him, and that in the nineteenth century, George Cayley Cayley, Spencer, Wenham, Mouillard, and many others were reported to have made feeble attempts to glide, but their failures were so complete that nothing of value resulted."

Berlins busiest airport, Berlin Tegel Airport Berlin Tegel "Otto Lilienthal" Airport, is named after him.

In September 1909, Orville Wright was in Germany making demonstration flights at Berlin Tempelhof Airport Tempelhof aerodrome. He paid a call to Lilienthals widow and, on behalf of himself and Wilbur, paid tribute to Lilienthal for his influence on aviation and on their own initial experiments in 1899.
