==Biography==

===Early years===
Clyde Vernon Cessna was born in Hawthorne, Iowa Hawthorne, in Montgomery County, Iowa on December 5, 1879. Cessnas family was of French and German ancestry.<ref>{{cite web last1=Chance first1=Carl title=CLYDE VERNON CESSNA url=http://www.wingsoverkansas.com/profiles/a70/}}</ref> When he was 2, he and his family moved to rural Rago, Kansas Rago in Kingman County, Kansas, along the Chikaskia River. During his boyhood he used his self-taught innovation and mechanical skills to improve farm machinery and to develop new farming methods.<ref name="wok">{{cite web url=http://www.wingsoverkansas.com/profiles/article.asp?id=70 title=Aviation Pioneers - Clyde Vernon Cessna accessdate=April 28, 2007 publisher=Wings Over Kansas}}</ref> He later became a successful car dealer in Enid, Oklahoma.<ref name="wok1">{{cite web url=https://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.wingsoverkansas.com/photos/prof_3-00_pic1.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.wingsoverkansas.com/profiles/article.asp%3Fid%3D66&h=160&w=250&sz=8&hl=en&start=13&sig2=vZf2x-9cfa0BcCHhWjExhQ&tbnid=q8-x6zmbCJwoIM:&tbnh=71&tbnw=111&ei=Y1Q3RvnnPIG2hAT_reSjAw&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dclyde%2Bcessna%26gbv%3D2%26svnum%3D10%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Dactive title=Clyde Cessna - Pioneer Aviator accessdate=May 1, 2007 publisher=Wings Over Kansas last=Phillips first=Edward H.}}</ref>

Clydes interest in aviation began in 1910 after witnessing an aerial exhibition in his home state of Kansas.<ref name="aerofiles">{{cite web url=http://www.aerofiles.com/bio_c.html title=Capsule Biographies: Clyde Cessna accessdate=April 28, 2007 publisher=aerofiles.com}}</ref> It was this exhibition that led him in future years to pursue his career in aviation.<ref name="cessna">{{cite web url=http://www.cessna.com/story/milestones/index.chtml#1911 title=Cessna Story-Milestones accessdate=April 28, 2007 publisher=Cessna.com deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914132400/http://www.cessna.com/story/milestones/index.chtml#1911 archivedate=September 14, 2008 df=mdy-all}}</ref> After realizing his interest in aviation, Clyde left Oklahoma and moved to New York (state) New York where he worked for a short period at the Queen Aeroplane Company where he first learned about the construction of aircraft.<ref name="wok1"/>

===First flight===
File:Cessna Comet.jpg thumb right Cessna with his second design, "Cessna Comet The Comet", an improved version of the Silverwing, circa 1916
In 1911, he set out to build his first airplane, an airplane he named "Silverwing".<ref name="wok1"/> His first design was a monoplane, constructed of spruce and linen and which took the form of an American version of the Bleriot XI. The engine was a modified Elbridge motorboat motor, dubbed the "aero special", which was a 2-stroke, 4-cylinder engine with a maximum of {{convert 40 hp abbr=on}} and 1,050&nbsp;rpm.<ref name="wok1"/> Upon completion, he sought to test the aircraft at the Great Salt Plains (adjacent to the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge) in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma. His first attempt at flight ended in a Ground loop (aviation) ground loop, which required $100 to repair. After repairs, Cessna attempted flight 13 more times, each time ending in some sort of failure. Finally on his 13th attempt, Cessna got a glimpse of hope as his aircraft bounced up into the air for a short time before crashing into the trees as he attempted to turn it. After his crash, Cessna exclaimed in frustration, "Im going to fly this thing, then Im going to set it afire and never have another thing to do with aeroplanes!". Finally, in June 1911 Cessna had his first successful flight. The crowds that had scoffed at his failures changed their tone and began calling him a "daring hero" and nicknamed him the "Birdman of Enid".<ref name="NAHF">{{cite web url=http://www.nationalaviation.org/our-enshrinees/cessna-clyde/ title=Clyde Cessna accessdate=April 28, 2007 publisher=National Aviation Hall of Fame}}</ref> Cessna continued to teach himself how to fly over the next several months until December 1911, when he made a successful {{convert 5 mi km adj=on}} flight and a successful landing at the point of departure.<ref name="wok1"/> He was the first person to build and fly an airplane in the Heartland (United States) Heartland of the United States—between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.172guide.com/history.htm title=The Cessna Story accessdate=September 29, 2015 publisher=172guide.com}}</ref>

===The middle years===

After the success of the Silverwing, Cessna permanently quit his work with the automobile industry to pursue his interests in aviation. Between 1912 and 1915, Cessna developed several new monoplanes, all powered by an Anzani 6-cylinder with 40–60&nbsp;hp. During this time, Clyde often flew his aircraft at holiday events and county fairs, an endeavour that at the time proved to be lucrative.<ref name="wok1"/>

It was in 1916 that Clyde acquired a vacant building to begin building a new aircraft for the 1917 aviation exhibition season. His factory served a dual purpose, as he also opened a flight school in which he had five enrolled student pilots. However, in April 1917 when the United States declared war, the exhibition flying market ground to a halt. With his primary source of income grounded, Clyde returned to his old home near Kingman County, Kansas Rago, Kansas, where he resumed his duties on the family farm.<ref name="wok1"/>

===Travel Air Manufacturing Company ===
In the years following World War I public interest in private flying increased, leading Cessna in 1925, along with Walter Herschel Beech Walter Beech and Lloyd Carlton Stearman Lloyd Stearman, to found the Travel Air Manufacturing Company in Wichita, Kansas. While Cessna was president, the company soon became one of the leading US aircraft manufacturers. This success may be attributed to Cessnas advanced design concepts and aircraft that attained international recognition in the course of establishing numerous speed and distance records.<ref name="aerofiles"/><ref name="kahs">{{cite web url=http://www.kshs.org/portraits/cessna_clyde.htm title=Clyde Cessna - A Kansas Portrait accessdate=April 28, 2007 publisher=Kansas State Historical Society}}</ref> After two years, Cessna left the company with plans to start his own firm,<ref name="kahs"/> due to design disputes with his partners over the monoplane versus the biplane.

===Cessna Aircraft Corporation===

On September 7, 1927, Cessna and aviation entrepreneur Victor Roos paired to form Cessna-Roos Aircraft. Roos resigned just one month into the partnership, selling back his interest to Cessna, and the company changed its name to Cessna Aircraft Corporation in December.<ref name="cessna"/><ref>{{cite book title=Air Transportation author=Robert M. Kane}}<!--publisher, place, & year?--></ref> In the later part of 1927, Cessna struggled to design and build an efficient monoplane. The Cessna AW AW was completed near the end of 1927.<ref name="aerofiles"/>

Cessna followed the AW with the Cessna CW-6 CW-6, which flew in 1928, and the Cessna DC-6 DC-6, which flew in 1929. He then collaborated with his son, Eldon, in designing and flying the Cessna CR-3 CR-series Air racing racing aircraft.<ref name="aerofiles"/>

Despite the success of new models, the Great Depression led to a catastrophic drop in aircraft sales, a bankruptcy filing for the corporation, and the complete closure of the company in 1931. In 1934, Cessna reopened his Wichita plant, which he soon sold to his nephews—aeronautical engineer Dwane Wallace and his brother, attorney Dwight Wallace—in 1936.<ref name="kahs"/><ref name="WingsOverKansas">{{cite web url=http://www.wingsoverkansas.com/phillips/a79/ title= DWANE L.

===Later years===
After turning over the Cessna Aircraft Corporation to his nephews, Dwane and Dwight Wallace, Cessna returned to a life of farming.<ref name="kahs"/> Clyde operated an early diesel three-track tractor building ponds for local farmers.<ref>{{cite journal magazine=AOPA Pilot date=May 2014 page=32 title=Wichita recalls Clyde Cessna}}</ref> Upon Dwanes request, he agreed to participate in the company but served mostly in a ceremonial capacity and stayed out of the companys day-to-day business.<ref name="wok1"/>

He died on November 20, 1954, at the age of 74 in Wichita, Kansas.<ref name="kahs"/><ref>{{cite news  author=Associated Press  coauthors=  title=Clyde Cessna, Airplane Builder, Pioneer Manufacturer, and Aviator Dies.
