In April 1941, Geiger made his way from Lisbon to Gibraltar, where he changed from civilian clothes to his military uniform. He had lunch with the Governor at Government House, in a visit which lifted British morale in Gibraltar. He was on his way to the Western Desert, as the first U.S. military observer attached to the British 8th Army. In August, he became Commanding General, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, Fleet Marine Force, in which capacity he was found upon the United States entry into World War II.

On September 3, 1942, he was stationed at Guadalcanal to lead the Cactus Air Force during the early part of the Guadalcanal Campaign. Until November 4, he was commander of the combined Army, Navy and Marines Air Forces stationed here of which the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing was part. He was awarded a 5/16 inch star Gold Star in lieu of a second Navy Cross for his service on Guadalcanal.

His citation reads in part, "Despite almost continuous bombardment by enemy aircraft, hostile naval gunfire and shore based artillery, the combined total of Army, Navy and Marine Corps units stationed at Guadalcanal under Major General Geigers efficiently coordinated command succeeded in shooting down 268 Japanese planes in aerial combat and inflicting damage on a number estimated to be as great ... Sank six enemy vessels, including one heavy cruiser, possibly sank three destroyers and one heavy cruiser, and damaged 18 other ships, including one heavy cruiser and five light cruisers."

Geiger was recalled to Marine Corps Headquarters in May 1943, to become Director of Aviation. In November 1943, he returned to the field, this time as Commanding General of the I Amphibious Corps and led the Corps from November 9, to December 15, 1943, in the Battle of Bougainville, for which he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal Distinguished Service Medal.

Redesignated III Amphibious Corps in April 1944, he led this organization in the invasion and subsequent Battle of Guam (1944) recapture of Guam during July and August 1944, and in the assault and capture of the southern Palau Islands in September and October of the same year. For those operations he was awarded two Gold Stars in lieu of a second and third Distinguished Service Medal.

Geiger led this Corps into action for the fourth time as part of the Tenth United States Army Tenth Army in the invasion and capture of Okinawa. On June 18, 1945, Geiger assumed command of the Tenth Army following the death in combat of Lt. General Simon Bolivar Buckner for the final five days of the battle.  He was relieved by General Joseph Stilwell.  To this day, Geiger remains the only Marine Corps officer to ever hold command of a field army.{{citation needed date=June 2018}} Geiger was appointed Commanding General of the Fleet Marine Force, Pacific in July 1945 and was promoted to Lieutenant general (United States) lieutenant general.<ref>Camp, Giants Of The Corps: "Rugged Roy" Geiger And The Northern Bombing Group, May 2006.</ref> Geiger was the only Marine Corps representative at the surrender of Japan aboard the {{USS Missouri BB-63}} on September 2, 1945.<ref>Wellons, James B., General Roy S.
