===U.S. Air Force===
He began his military career joining the United States Air Force Air Force Aviation Cadet Program at age 19, later becoming an Air Force lieutenant. Rutan served during the Vietnam War as one of the founding members of the “Mistys” of 416th Fighter Squadron#Vietnam War Operation Commando Sabre,<ref name=Newman/> pioneering the use of tactical jets as a “Forward air controllers in the Vietnam War#Fast FACs FastFAC” (known as forward air control) for the FAC Airborne mission, which searched for and marked targets with white phosphorus rockets ahead of the strike package. He flew 325 missions but had to ejection seat eject when his “Hun” F-100 Super Sabre aircraft was hit. Rutan had to eject a second time in his Air Force career when his aircraft suffered an engine failure over England.

During his career with the Air Force, Rutan was awarded the Silver Star, five Distinguished Flying Cross (USA) Distinguished Flying Crosses, 16 Air Medals, and a Purple Heart. He retired from the Air Force in 1978 with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel (United States) lieutenant colonel.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.dickrutan.com/biography.html title=Biography website=www.dickrutan.com}}</ref>

===Post military career===
Rutan also acted as a test pilot throughout his career, flying multiple designs such as the Fairchild T-46 in 1981 and the XCOR EZ-Rocket in 2001.

From December 14 to December 23, 1986, Rutan flew with Jeana Yeager on the first unrefueled non-stop flight around the world in the Rutan Voyager, a design by his brother Burt. The flight attracted world wide media coverage and set multiple records.

In 1997, Dick Rutan and Mike Melvill flew two Rutan Long-EZ Long-Eze aircraft that they built side-by-side around the world. This "around the world in 80 nights" flight was called The Spirit of Experimental Aircraft Association EAA Friendship World Tour, and some legs of it lasted for over 14 hours.<ref>{{cite web url=http://airportjournals.com/dick-rutan-the-frontiers-of-flight-the-last-great-world-record/ title=Dick Rutan The Frontiers of Flight – The Last Great World Record date=10 October 2014 publisher=}}</ref>

==Campaign for congress==
In 1992 Rutan ran as a conservative Republican Party (United States) Republican against Democratic congressman George Brown, Jr. in Californias 42nd congressional district; comprised mostly by the San Bernardino region of southern California and viewed as a swing district. In the Republican primary, Rutan upset San Bernardino County, California San Bernardino County Supervisor Rob Hammock, who had run a strong race against Brown in 1990. In the general election, Rutan ran on a platform that called for reforming congress and lowering taxes. Brown, first elected in 1962, was long known for surviving close elections and prevailed once more with 79,780 votes (50.7%) to Rutans 69,251 (44%). Fritz Ward, a Libertarian Party (United States) Libertarian, received 8,424 votes or 5.3% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1992/92Stat.htm#5 title=92 PRESIDENTIAL and CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION STATISTICS website=clerk.house.gov}}</ref>

==Records==
Besides the records Rutan set while flying Voyager (which consisted of multiple distance records, a speed record and being the first plane to fly non-stop and unrefueled around the world, more than doubling the old Flight distance record distance record set by a Boeing B-52 bomber in 1962),<ref name=distance>"[http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=8389 FAI Record ID #8389 - Distance] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924045338/http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=8389  date=2015-09-24 }}" Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).
