Charles Elwood "Chuck" Yeager ({{IPAc-en ˈ j eɪ ɡ ər}}; born {{nowrap February 13}}, 1923) is a former United States Air Force officer, flying ace, and record-setting test pilot. In 1947, he became the first pilot confirmed to have exceeded the speed of sound in level flight.

Yeagers career began in World War II as a Private (rank) private in the United States Army Air Forces.
After serving as an aircraft mechanic, in September 1942 he entered Enlisted rank enlisted pilot training and upon graduation was promoted to the rank of flight officer (the World War II USAAF equivalent to Warrant Officer (United States) warrant officer) and became a North American P-51 Mustang P-51 fighter pilot.

After the war, Yeager became a test pilot of many types of aircraft, including experimental rocket-powered aircraft. As the first human to officially break the sound barrier, on {{nowrap October 14}}, 1947, he flew the experimental Bell X-1 at Mach number Mach 1 at an altitude of {{nowrap 45,000 ft}} ({{nowrap 13,700 m}}). He then went on to break several other speed and altitude records.

Yeager later commanded fighter squadrons and wings in Germany, and in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, and in recognition of the outstanding performance ratings of those units he was promoted to brigadier general. Yeagers flying career spans more than 60 years and has taken him to many parts of the world, including the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War.

==Early life and education==
Yeager was born {{nowrap February 13}}, 1923, to farming parents Susie Mae and Albert Hal Yeager in Myra, West Virginia, and graduated from high school in Hamlin, West Virginia, in June 1941. He had two brothers, Roy and Hal Jr., and two sisters, Doris Ann (accidentally killed at age 2 by 6-year-old Roy playing with a shotgun)
and Pansy Lee. His first experience with the military was as a teen at the Citizens Military Training Camp at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis, Indiana, during the summers of 1939 and 1940. On {{nowrap February 26}}, 1945, Yeager married Glennis Dickhouse, and the couple had four children. Glennis died in 1990.
The name "Yeager" ({{IPAc-en ˈ j eɪ ɡ ər}}) is an Anglicized form of the German name Jäger or Jaeger (German: "hunter"). He is the cousin of former baseball catcher Steve Yeager.
{{refn Chuck Yeager is not related to Jeana Yeager, one of the two pilots of the Rutan Voyager aircraft, which circled the world without landing or refueling.

==Career==

===World War II===
Yeager enlisted as a private in the United States Army Air Forces U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) on {{nowrap September 12}}, 1941, and became an aircraft mechanic at George Air Force Base, Victorville, California. At enlistment, Yeager was not eligible for flight training because of his age and educational background, but the entry of the U.S. into World War II less than three months later prompted the USAAF to alter its recruiting standards. Having unusually sharp vision (a visual acuity visual acuity rated 20/10), which once enabled him to shoot a deer at {{convert 600 yd}},
Yeager displayed natural talent as a pilot and was accepted for flight training.

He received his wings and a promotion to Warrant Officer (United States)#Flight Officer flight officer at Luke Air Force Base Luke Field, Arizona, where he graduated from class 43C on {{nowrap March 10}}, 1943. Assigned to the 357th Fighter Group at Tonopah, Nevada, he initially trained as a fighter pilot, flying Bell P-39 Airacobras (being grounded for seven days for clipping a farmers tree during a training flight),
and shipped overseas with the group on {{nowrap November 23}}, 1943.

File:P51-1 300.jpg thumb North American P-51 Mustang P-51D-20NA, Glamorous Glen III, is the aircraft in which Yeager achieved most of his aerial victories.
Stationed in the United Kingdom at RAF Leiston, Yeager flew North American P-51 Mustang P-51 Mustangs in combat with the 363d Fighter Squadron. He named his aircraft Glamorous Glen
after his girlfriend, Glennis Faye Dickhouse, who became his wife in February 1945. Yeager had gained one victory before he was shot down over France in his first aircraft (P-51B-5-NA s/n 43-6763) on {{nowrap March 5}}, 1944 during his eighth mission.
He escaped to Spain on {{nowrap March 30}} with the help of the Maquis (World War II) Maquis (French Resistance) and returned to England on {{nowrap May 15}}, 1944. During his stay with the Maquis, Yeager assisted the guerrillas in duties that did not involve direct combat; he helped construct bombs for the group, a skill that he had learned from his father.
He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal Bronze Star for helping a B-24 navigator, "Pat" Patterson, who was shot in the knee during the escape attempt, to cross the Pyrenees. Yeager cut off the tendon by which Pattersons leg was hanging below the knee, then tied off the leg with a spare shirt made of parachute silk.
Despite a regulation prohibiting "evaders" (escaped pilots) from flying over enemy territory again, the purpose of which was to prevent a second capture from compromising resistance groups, Yeager was reinstated to flying combat. He had joined another evader, fellow P-51 pilot 1st Lt Fred Glover,
in speaking directly to the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, on {{nowrap June 12}}, 1944. With Glover pleading their case, they argued that because the Allies had invaded France and the Maquis were by then openly fighting the Nazis alongside Allied troops, if Yeager or Glover were shot down again, there was little about those who had previously helped them evade capture that could be revealed to the enemy.

Eisenhower, after gaining permission from the War Department to decide the requests, concurred with Yeager and Glover. Yeager later credited his postwar success in the Air Force to this decision, saying that his test pilot career followed naturally from his having been a decorated combat pilot, along with having been an aircraft mechanic before attending pilot school. In part, because of his maintenance background, he also frequently served as a maintenance officer in his flying units.

Yeager demonstrated outstanding flying skills and combat leadership. On {{nowrap October 12}}, 1944, he became the first pilot in his group to make "ace in a day," downing five enemy aircraft in a single mission. Two of these kills were scored without firing a single shot: when he flew into firing position against a Messerschmitt Bf 109, the pilot of the aircraft panicked, breaking to starboard and colliding with his wingman. Yeager said both pilots bailed out. He finished the war with 11.5 official victories, including one of the first air-to-air victories over a jet fighter, a German Messerschmitt Me 262 that he shot down as it was on final approach for landing.
In his 1986 memoirs, Yeager recalled with disgust that "atrocities were committed by both sides" said he went on a mission with orders from the Eighth Air Force to "strafe anything that moved."
During the mission briefing, he whispered to Major Donald H. Bochkay, "If we are going to do things like this, we sure as hell better make sure we are on the winning side."
Yeager said, "I’m certainly not proud of that particular strafing mission against civilians. But it is there, on the record and in my memory."
He has also expressed bitterness at his treatment in England during WWII, describing the British as "arrogant" and "nasty".
Yeager was commissioned a US Second Lieutenant second lieutenant while at Leiston, and was promoted to Captain (U.S. Air Force) captain before the end of his tour. He flew his 61st and final mission on {{nowrap January 15}}, 1945, and returned to the United States in early February. As an evader, he received his choice of assignments and, because his new wife was pregnant, chose Wright Field to be near his home in West Virginia. His high number of flight hours and maintenance experience qualified him to become a functional test pilot of repaired aircraft, which brought him under the command of Colonel Albert Boyd, head of the Aeronautical Systems Flight Test Division.
===Post-World War II===

====Test pilot – breaking the sound barrier====
File:Yeager supersonic flight 1947.ogv thumb Yeager broke the sound barrier on {{nowrap October 14}}, 1947, in the X-1.
Yeager remained in the United States Air Force Air Force after the war, becoming a test pilot at Muroc Army Air Field (now Edwards Air Force Base), following graduation from U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School Air Materiel Command Flight Performance School (Class 46C).
After Bell Aircraft test pilot Chalmers "Slick" Goodlin demanded $150,000 ($1.6 million in 2015 dollars) to break the sound "barrier," the USAAF selected Yeager to fly the rocket-powered Bell X-1 Bell XS-1 in a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics NACA program to research high-speed flight.
File:Chuck Yeager.jpg thumb Yeager in front of the Bell X-1, which, as with all of the aircraft assigned to him, he named Glamorous Glennis (or some variation thereof), after his wife.
File:Chuck Yeager X-1 (color).jpg thumb Yeager in the Bell X-1 cockpit
Such was the difficulty in this task that the answer to many of the inherent challenges was along the lines of "Yeager better have paid-up insurance."
Two nights before the scheduled date for the flight, Yeager broke two ribs when he fell from a horse. He was worried that the injury would remove him from the mission and reported that he went to a civilian doctor in nearby Rosamond, California Rosamond, who taped his ribs.
{{refn In some versions of the story, the doctor was a veterinarian; however, local residents have noted that Rosamond was so small that it had neither a medical doctor nor a veterinarian.
group=Note}} Yeager told only his wife, as well as friend and fellow project pilot Jack Ridley (pilot) Jack Ridley, about the accident. On the day of the flight, Yeager was in such pain that he could not seal the X-1s hatch by himself. Ridley rigged up a device, using the end of a broom handle as an extra lever, to allow Yeager to seal the hatch.

Yeager broke the sound barrier on {{nowrap October 14}}, 1947, flying the X-1 Glamorous Glennis at Mach number Mach 1.07 at an altitude of {{nowrap 45,000 ft}} ({{nowrap 13,700 m}}).
{{refn There is anecdotal evidence that American pilot George Welch (pilot) George Welch may have broken the sound barrier two weeks before Yeager, while diving an North American F-86 Sabre XP-86 Sabre on {{nowrap October 1}}, 1947, and again on {{nowrap October 14}}, just 30 minutes before Yeagers X-1 flight. However, the precision instruments used to carefully document the speed of Yeagers flight were not used during Welchs flights.
Even earlier, German pilot Lothar Sieber was estimated to have broken the speed of sound during his fatal test-flight of the rocket-powered Bachem Natter on March 1, 1945, although the speed was not officially measured.
In his 1990 book Me-163, former Messerschmitt Me 163 "Komet" pilot Mano Ziegler claims that his friend, test pilot Heini Dittmar, broke the sound barrier and that on 6 July 1944 he reached 1,130 km/h in dive, and that several people on the ground heard the sonic booms. There was also a disputed claim by German pilot Hans Guido Mutke that he was the first person to break the sound barrier, on {{nowrap April 9}}, 1945, in a Messerschmitt Me 262 Me 262.
group=Note}} over the Rogers Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert.
Yeager was awarded the Mackay Trophy and the Collier Trophy in 1948 for his mach-transcending flight, and the Harmon International Trophy in 1954. The X-1 he flew that day was later put on permanent display at the Smithsonian Institutions National Air and Space Museum.

Yeager went on to break many other speed and altitude records. He was also one of the first American pilots to fly a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 MiG-15, after its pilot, No Kum-sok, defected to South Korea.
Returning to Muroc, during the latter half of 1953, Yeager was involved with the USAF team that was working on the Bell X-1#X-1A X-1A, an aircraft designed to surpass Mach 2 in level flight. That year, he flew a chase plane chase aircraft for the civilian pilot Jacqueline Cochran Jackie Cochran as she became the first woman to fly faster than sound.
On {{nowrap November 20}}, 1953, the U.S. Navy program involving the Douglas Skyrocket D-558-II Skyrocket and its pilot, Albert Scott Crossfield Scott Crossfield, became the first team to reach twice the speed of sound. After they were bested, Ridley and Yeager decided to beat rival Crossfields speed record in a series of test flights that they dubbed "Operation NACA Weep." Not only did they beat Crossfield by setting a new record at Mach 2.44 on {{nowrap December 12}}, 1953, but they did it in time to spoil a celebration planned for the Wright brothers 50th anniversary of flight in which Crossfield was to be called "the fastest man alive."
The new record flight, however, did not entirely go to plan, since shortly after reaching Mach 2.44, Yeager lost control of the X-1A at about {{convert 80000 ft m abbr=on}} due to inertia coupling, a phenomenon largely unknown at the time. With the aircraft simultaneously rolling, pitching, and yawing out of control, Yeager dropped {{convert 51000 ft m}} in less than a minute before regaining control at around {{convert 29000 ft m}}. He then managed to land without further incident.
For this achievement, Yeager was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army) Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) in 1954.{{Refn Yeager received the DSM in the Army design, since the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal was not awarded until 1965. group=Note}}

====Military command====
File:Charles Yeager photo portrait head on shoulders left side.jpg thumb upright Chuck Yeager in 1950
Yeager was foremost a fighter pilot and held several squadron and wing commands. From May 1955 to July 1957 he commanded the North American F-86 Sabre F-86H Sabre-equipped 417th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (50th Fighter-Bomber Wing) at Frankfurt-Hahn Airport Hahn AB, Germany, and Toul-Rosieres Air Base, France; and from 1957 to 1960 the North American F-100 Super Sabre F-100D Super Sabre-equipped 1st Fighter Squadron (United States) 1st Fighter Day Squadron (later, while still under Yeagers command, re-designated the 306th Tactical Fighter Squadron) at George Air Force Base, California, and Morón Air Base, Spain.

Now a full colonel
in 1962, after completion of a years studies at the Air War College, Yeager became the first commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School, which produced astronauts for National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA and the USAF, after its redesignation from the USAF Flight Test Pilot School. (Yeager himself had only a high school education, so he was not eligible to become an astronaut like those he trained.) Between December 1963 and January 1964,
Yeager completed five flights in the NASA M2-F1 lifting body. An accident during a Lockheed NF-104A#Third NF-104A December 1963 test flight in one of the schools Lockheed NF-104A NF-104s eventually put an end to his record attempts.

In 1966 Yeager took command of the 405th Tactical Fighter Wing at Clark Air Base, the Philippines, whose squadrons were deployed on rotational temporary duty (TDY) in South Vietnam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. There he accrued another 414 hours of combat time in 127 missions, mostly in a Martin B-57 Canberra light bomber. In February 1968, Yeager was assigned command of the 4th Fighter Wing 4th Tactical Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, and led the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II wing in South Korea during the USS Pueblo (AGER-2) Pueblo crisis.

On {{nowrap June 22}}, 1969, Yeager was promoted to Brigadier general (United States) brigadier general and was assigned in July as the vice-commander of the Seventeenth Air Force.

From 1971 to 1973, at the behest of Ambassador Joe Farland, Yeager was assigned to Pakistan to advise the Pakistan Air Force.
In one of the numerous raids carried out by Indian pilots against Pakistani airfields, Yeagers plane was destroyed while it was parked at Islamabad airport.
Edward C. Ingraham, a U.S diplomat who had served as political counselor to Ambassador Farland in Islamabad recalled this incident in the Washington Monthly of October, 1985: "After Yeager’s Beechcraft was destroyed during an Indian air raid, he raged to his cowering colleagues that the Indian pilot had been specifically instructed by Indira Gandhi to blast his plane. It was, he later wrote, the Indian way of giving Uncle Sam the finger."
===Post-retirement career===
File:ChuckYeager.jpeg thumb upright Brigadier General Yeager in 2000

On {{nowrap March 1}}, 1975, following assignments in Germany and Pakistan, Yeager retired from the Air Force at Norton Air Force Base after serving over 33 years on active duty, although he continued to occasionally fly for the USAF and NASA as a consulting test pilot at Edwards AFB.{{refn For his consultant work to the Test Pilot School Commander at Edwards Air Force Base, Yeager was paid one dollar annually, along with all the flying time he wanted. The $1 allowed him to be covered by workers compensation insurance. group=Note}}

Yeager made a cameo appearance in the movie The Right Stuff (film) The Right Stuff (1983). He played "Fred," a bartender at Happy Bottom Riding Club "Panchos Place", which was most appropriate, as Yeager said, "if all the hours were ever totaled, I reckon I spent more time at her place than in a cockpit over those years."
His own role in the movie was played by Sam Shepard.

For several years in the 1980s, Yeager was connected to General Motors, publicizing AC Delco, the companys automotive parts division.
In 1986 he was invited to drive the Chevrolet Corvette pace car for the 1986 Indianapolis 500 70th running of the Indianapolis 500. In 1988 Indianapolis 500 1988, Yeager was again invited to drive the pace car, this time at the wheel of an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. In 1986, President Reagan appointed Yeager to the Rogers Commission that investigated the explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger Space Shuttle Challenger.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Yeager set several light general aircraft performance records for speed, range, and endurance. Most notable were flights conducted on behalf of Piper Aircraft. On one such flight, Yeager performed an emergency landing as a result of fuel exhaustion. On another, he piloted Pipers turboprop Piper PA-42 Cheyenne Cheyenne 400LS to a time-to-height record: FL350 (35,000 feet) in 16 minutes, exceeding the climb performance of a Boeing 737 at gross weight.

During this time Yeager also served as a technical adviser for three Electronic Arts flight simulator video games. The games include Chuck Yeagers Advanced Flight Trainer, Chuck Yeagers Advanced Flight Trainer 2.0, and Chuck Yeagers Air Combat. The game manuals featured quotes and anecdotes from Yeager, and were well received by players. Missions featured several of Yeagers accomplishments and let players attempt to top his records. Chuck Yeagers Advanced Flight Trainer was Electronic Arts top selling game for 1987.
In 2009, Yeager participated in the documentary The Legend of Pancho Barnes and the Happy Bottom Riding Club, a profile of his friend Pancho Barnes. The documentary was screened at film festivals, aired on public television in the United States and won an Emmy Award.
Yeager is fully retired from military test flying, after having maintained that status for three decades after his official retirement from the Air Force. On {{nowrap October 14}}, 1997, on the 50th anniversary of his historic flight past Mach 1, he flew a new Glamorous Glennis III, an McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle F-15D Eagle, past Mach 1. The chase plane for the flight was an General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon F-16 Fighting Falcon piloted by Bob Hoover, a longtime test, fighter and aerobatic pilot who had been Yeagers wingman for the first supersonic flight. This was Yeagers last official flight with the U.S. Air Force. At the end of his speech to the crowd, Yeager concluded, "All that I am ... I owe to the Air Force." Later that month, he was the recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for his achievements.

On {{nowrap October 14}}, 2012, on the 65th anniversary of breaking the sound barrier, Yeager did it again at the age of 89, riding in a McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle piloted by Captain David Vincent out of Nellis Air Force Base.
==Awards and decorations==
File:Yeager congressional silver medal.jpg thumb Special Congressional Silver Medal awarded to Yeager in 1976
In 1973, Yeager was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame, arguably aviations highest honor. In December 1975, the U.S. Congress awarded Yeager a silver medal "equivalent to a noncombat Medal of Honor ... for contributing immeasurably to aerospace science by risking his life in piloting the X-1 research airplane faster than the speed of sound on {{nowrap October 14}}, 1947." President Gerald Ford presented the medal to Yeager in a ceremony at the White House on {{nowrap December 8}}, 1976.
{{refn This is apparently a unique award, as the law that created it states it is equivalent to a noncombat Medal of Honor. It is referred to as a Special Congressional Silver Medal in the Presidents Daily Diary (also see for a list of ceremony attendees).
group=Note}}

Yeager, who never attended college and was often modest about his background, is considered by many, including Flying Magazine, the California Hall of Fame, the State of West Virginia, National Aviation Hall of Fame, a few U.S. presidents, and the United States Army Air Force, to be one of the greatest pilots of all time. Despite his lack of higher education, he has been honored in his home state. Marshall University has named its highest academic scholarship, the Society of Yeager Scholars, in his honor. Yeager was also the chairman of Experimental Aircraft Associations Young Eagles Young Eagle Program from 1994–2004, and has been named the programs chairman emeritus.
In 1966, Yeager was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.
Yeager Airport in Charleston, West Virginia, is named in his honor. The Interstate 64/Interstate 77 bridge over the Kanawha River in Charleston is named in his honor. On {{nowrap October 19}}, 2006, the state of West Virginia also honored Yeager with a marker along Corridor G (Appalachian Development Highway System) Corridor G (part of U.S. Route 119 U.S. 119) in his home Lincoln County, and also renamed part of the highway the Yeager Highway.
Yeager is an honorary board member of the humanitarian organization Wings of Hope (charity) Wings of Hope.
On {{nowrap August 25}}, 2009, Governor Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver announced that Yeager would be one of 13 California Hall of Fame inductees in The California Museums yearlong exhibit. The induction ceremony was on {{nowrap December 1}}, 2009, in Sacramento, California. Flying Magazine ranked Yeager number 5 on its 2013 list of The 51 Heroes of Aviation; he is the highest-ranked living person on the list.
The Civil Air Patrol, the volunteer auxiliary of the USAF, awards the Charles E. "Chuck" Yeager Award to its Senior Members as part of its Aerospace Education program.
The General Chuck Yeager Cadet Squadron (SER-FL-237), associated with the Florida Wing, Civil Air Patrol, and based in Brandon, Florida, is also named in his honor.

==Personal life==
Yeager named his plane after his wife Glennis as a good-luck charm; "Youre my good-luck charm, hon. Any airplane I name after you always brings me home".
Yeager and Glennis moved to Grass Valley, California, after his retirement from the Air Force in 1975. The couple prospered because of Yeagers best-selling autobiography, speaking engagements and commercial ventures.
Glennis Yeager died of ovarian cancer in 1990. They had four children (Susan, Don, Mickey and Sharon).
In 2000, Yeager met actress Victoria Scott DAngelo on a hiking trail in Nevada County. The pair started dating shortly thereafter, and married in August 2003.
