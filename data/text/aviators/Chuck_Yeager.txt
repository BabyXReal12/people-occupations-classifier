Charles Elwood "Chuck" Yeager ({{IPAc-en ˈ j eɪ ɡ ər}}; born {{nowrap February 13}}, 1923) is a former United States Air Force officer, flying ace, and record-setting test pilot. In 1947, he became the first pilot confirmed to have exceeded the speed of sound in level flight.

Yeagers career began in World War II as a Private (rank) private in the United States Army Air Forces.<ref>Yeager had not been in an airplane prior to January 1942, when his Engineering Officer invited him on a test flight after maintenance of an Beechcraft Model 18 AT-11. He related that he got really sick on the flight: "After puking all over myself I said, Yeager, you made a big mistake". My First Time, Air & Space/Smithsonian, Vol. 17 No. 2 (June/July 2002), p. 48</ref> After serving as an aircraft mechanic, in September 1942 he entered Enlisted rank enlisted pilot training and upon graduation was promoted to the rank of flight officer (the World War II USAAF equivalent to Warrant Officer (United States) warrant officer) and became a North American P-51 Mustang P-51 fighter pilot.

After the war, Yeager became a test pilot of many types of aircraft, including experimental rocket-powered aircraft. As the first human to officially break the sound barrier, on {{nowrap October 14}}, 1947, he flew the experimental Bell X-1 at Mach number Mach 1 at an altitude of {{nowrap 45,000 ft}} ({{nowrap 13,700 m}}). He then went on to break several other speed and altitude records.

Yeager later commanded fighter squadrons and wings in Germany, and in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, and in recognition of the outstanding performance ratings of those units he was promoted to brigadier general. Yeagers flying career spans more than 60 years and has taken him to many parts of the world, including the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War.

==Early life and education==
Yeager was born {{nowrap February 13}}, 1923, to farming parents Susie Mae and Albert Hal Yeager in Myra, West Virginia, and graduated from high school in Hamlin, West Virginia, in June 1941. He had two brothers, Roy and Hal Jr., and two sisters, Doris Ann (accidentally killed at age 2 by 6-year-old Roy playing with a shotgun)<ref name="yeagerEsquire">[http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/chuck-yeager-quotes-0109 Esquire Magazine – Chuck Yeager: What Ive Learned]</ref><ref name="yeagerbio_6">Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 6.</ref> and Pansy Lee. His first experience with the military was as a teen at the Citizens Military Training Camp at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis, Indiana, during the summers of 1939 and 1940. On {{nowrap February 26}}, 1945, Yeager married Glennis Dickhouse, and the couple had four children. Glennis died in 1990.<ref name="Dickhouse">Houvouras, John H.

==Career==

===World War II===
Yeager enlisted as a private in the United States Army Air Forces U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) on {{nowrap September 12}}, 1941, and became an aircraft mechanic at George Air Force Base, Victorville, California. At enlistment, Yeager was not eligible for flight training because of his age and educational background, but the entry of the U.S. into World War II less than three months later prompted the USAAF to alter its recruiting standards.

He received his wings and a promotion to Warrant Officer (United States)#Flight Officer flight officer at Luke Air Force Base Luke Field, Arizona, where he graduated from class 43C on {{nowrap March 10}}, 1943. Assigned to the 357th Fighter Group at Tonopah, Nevada, he initially trained as a fighter pilot, flying Bell P-39 Airacobras (being grounded for seven days for clipping a farmers tree during a training flight),<ref>Take Off magazine, Issue 36, p. 991.</ref> and shipped overseas with the group on {{nowrap November 23}}, 1943.

Despite a regulation prohibiting "evaders" (escaped pilots) from flying over enemy territory again, the purpose of which was to prevent a second capture from compromising resistance groups, Yeager was reinstated to flying combat. He had joined another evader, fellow P-51 pilot 1st Lt Fred Glover,<ref>Disney 2016.</ref> in speaking directly to the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, on {{nowrap June 12}}, 1944. With Glover pleading their case, they argued that because the Allies had invaded France and the Maquis were by then openly fighting the Nazis alongside Allied troops, if Yeager or Glover were shot down again, there was little about those who had previously helped them evade capture that could be revealed to the enemy.

Eisenhower, after gaining permission from the War Department to decide the requests, concurred with Yeager and Glover. Yeager later credited his postwar success in the Air Force to this decision, saying that his test pilot career followed naturally from his having been a decorated combat pilot, along with having been an aircraft mechanic before attending pilot school. In part, because of his maintenance background, he also frequently served as a maintenance officer in his flying units.

Yeager demonstrated outstanding flying skills and combat leadership. On {{nowrap October 12}}, 1944, he became the first pilot in his group to make "ace in a day," downing five enemy aircraft in a single mission. Two of these kills were scored without firing a single shot: when he flew into firing position against a Messerschmitt Bf 109, the pilot of the aircraft panicked, breaking to starboard and colliding with his wingman. Yeager said both pilots bailed out. He finished the war with 11.5 official victories, including one of the first air-to-air victories over a jet fighter, a German Messerschmitt Me 262 that he shot down as it was on final approach for landing.<ref>{{cite web url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/wwii/chuck-yeager-fighter-pilot/ last=Niderost first=Eric title=Chuck Yeager: Fighter Pilot website=Warfare History Network access-date=29 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.chuckyeager.com/yeager-destroys-an-me-262 title=Encounter Report date=6 November 1944}}</ref>

In his 1986 memoirs, Yeager recalled with disgust that "atrocities were committed by both sides" said he went on a mission with orders from the Eighth Air Force to "strafe anything that moved."<ref name="Wolfgang W. E p454">Samuel 2004, p. 454.</ref><ref name="J. Coady p.13">Coady 2008, p. 13.</ref> During the mission briefing, he whispered to Major Donald H.

Yeager was commissioned a US Second Lieutenant second lieutenant while at Leiston, and was promoted to Captain (U.S. Air Force) captain before the end of his tour. He flew his 61st and final mission on {{nowrap January 15}}, 1945, and returned to the United States in early February. As an evader, he received his choice of assignments and, because his new wife was pregnant, chose Wright Field to be near his home in West Virginia. His high number of flight hours and maintenance experience qualified him to become a functional test pilot of repaired aircraft, which brought him under the command of Colonel Albert Boyd, head of the Aeronautical Systems Flight Test Division.<ref name="yeagerbio_60">Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 60.</ref>

====Military command====
File:Charles Yeager photo portrait head on shoulders left side.jpg thumb upright Chuck Yeager in 1950
Yeager was foremost a fighter pilot and held several squadron and wing commands. From May 1955 to July 1957 he commanded the North American F-86 Sabre F-86H Sabre-equipped 417th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (50th Fighter-Bomber Wing) at Frankfurt-Hahn Airport Hahn AB, Germany, and Toul-Rosieres Air Base, France; and from 1957 to 1960 the North American F-100 Super Sabre F-100D Super Sabre-equipped 1st Fighter Squadron (United States) 1st Fighter Day Squadron (later, while still under Yeagers command, re-designated the 306th Tactical Fighter Squadron) at George Air Force Base, California, and Morón Air Base, Spain.

Now a full colonel<ref>[http://www.chuckyeager.com/1961-1975-to-new-heights Yeager (n.d.). To New Heights: 1961–1975]</ref> in 1962, after completion of a years studies at the Air War College, Yeager became the first commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School, which produced astronauts for National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA and the USAF, after its redesignation from the USAF Flight Test Pilot School. (Yeager himself had only a high school education, so he was not eligible to become an astronaut like those he trained.) Between December 1963 and January 1964,<ref name=Crash>[http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/NF-104A_crash_site.htm "The Crash of Chuck Yeagers NF-104A".] check-six.com, December 10, 1963.</ref> Yeager completed five flights in the NASA M2-F1 lifting body. An accident during a Lockheed NF-104A#Third NF-104A December 1963 test flight in one of the schools Lockheed NF-104A NF-104s eventually put an end to his record attempts.

In 1966 Yeager took command of the 405th Tactical Fighter Wing at Clark Air Base, the Philippines, whose squadrons were deployed on rotational temporary duty (TDY) in South Vietnam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. There he accrued another 414 hours of combat time in 127 missions, mostly in a Martin B-57 Canberra light bomber. In February 1968, Yeager was assigned command of the 4th Fighter Wing 4th Tactical Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, and led the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II wing in South Korea during the USS Pueblo (AGER-2) Pueblo crisis.

On {{nowrap June 22}}, 1969, Yeager was promoted to Brigadier general (United States) brigadier general and was assigned in July as the vice-commander of the Seventeenth Air Force.

From 1971 to 1973, at the behest of Ambassador Joe Farland, Yeager was assigned to Pakistan to advise the Pakistan Air Force.<ref name="yeagerbio_391">Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 391.</ref>  In one of the numerous raids carried out by Indian pilots against Pakistani airfields, Yeagers plane was destroyed while it was parked at Islamabad airport.<ref name="yeagerbio_398">Yeager and Janos 1985, pp. 398.</ref>  Edward C.

===Post-retirement career===

On {{nowrap March 1}}, 1975, following assignments in Germany and Pakistan, Yeager retired from the Air Force at Norton Air Force Base after serving over 33 years on active duty, although he continued to occasionally fly for the USAF and NASA as a consulting test pilot at Edwards AFB.{{refn For his consultant work to the Test Pilot School Commander at Edwards Air Force Base, Yeager was paid one dollar annually, along with all the flying time he wanted. The $1 allowed him to be covered by workers compensation insurance. group=Note}}

Yeager made a cameo appearance in the movie The Right Stuff (film) The Right Stuff (1983). He played "Fred," a bartender at Happy Bottom Riding Club "Panchos Place", which was most appropriate, as Yeager said, "if all the hours were ever totaled, I reckon I spent more time at her place than in a cockpit over those years."<ref>Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 172.</ref> His own role in the movie was played by Sam Shepard.

For several years in the 1980s, Yeager was connected to General Motors, publicizing AC Delco, the companys automotive parts division.<ref name="yeagerbio_418">Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 418.</ref> In 1986 he was invited to drive the Chevrolet Corvette pace car for the 1986 Indianapolis 500 70th running of the Indianapolis 500. In 1988 Indianapolis 500 1988, Yeager was again invited to drive the pace car, this time at the wheel of an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. In 1986, President Reagan appointed Yeager to the Rogers Commission that investigated the explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger Space Shuttle Challenger.<ref>[http://www.456fis.org/CHUCK_YEAGER_BIOGRAPHY.htm "Brigadier General Charles E. Yeager."] The 456th Fighter Interceptor Squadron. Retrieved: December 8, 2010.</ref>

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Yeager set several light general aircraft performance records for speed, range, and endurance. Most notable were flights conducted on behalf of Piper Aircraft. On one such flight, Yeager performed an emergency landing as a result of fuel exhaustion. On another, he piloted Pipers turboprop Piper PA-42 Cheyenne Cheyenne 400LS to a time-to-height record: FL350 (35,000 feet) in 16 minutes, exceeding the climb performance of a Boeing 737 at gross weight.

During this time Yeager also served as a technical adviser for three Electronic Arts flight simulator video games. The games include Chuck Yeagers Advanced Flight Trainer, Chuck Yeagers Advanced Flight Trainer 2.0, and Chuck Yeagers Air Combat. The game manuals featured quotes and anecdotes from Yeager, and were well received by players. Missions featured several of Yeagers accomplishments and let players attempt to top his records. Chuck Yeagers Advanced Flight Trainer was Electronic Arts top selling game for 1987.<ref>[http://www.mobygames.com/game/chuck-yeagers-advanced-flight-simulator "Moby Games"] Chuck Yeagers Advanced Flight Trainer Retrieved: June 9th, 2017.</ref>

In 2009, Yeager participated in the documentary The Legend of Pancho Barnes and the Happy Bottom Riding Club, a profile of his friend Pancho Barnes. The documentary was screened at film festivals, aired on public television in the United States and won an Emmy Award.<ref>{{Cite web  url=http://www.legendofpanchobarnes.com/  title=Archived copy  access-date=2013-08-03  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523111947/http://www.legendofpanchobarnes.com/  archive-date=2013-05-23  dead-url=yes  df= }}</ref>

Yeager is fully retired from military test flying, after having maintained that status for three decades after his official retirement from the Air Force. On {{nowrap October 14}}, 1997, on the 50th anniversary of his historic flight past Mach 1, he flew a new Glamorous Glennis III, an McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle F-15D Eagle, past Mach 1. The chase plane for the flight was an General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon F-16 Fighting Falcon piloted by Bob Hoover, a longtime test, fighter and aerobatic pilot who had been Yeagers wingman for the first supersonic flight. This was Yeagers last official flight with the U.S. Air Force. At the end of his speech to the crowd, Yeager concluded, "All that I am ... I owe to the Air Force." Later that month, he was the recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for his achievements.

On {{nowrap October 14}}, 2012, on the 65th anniversary of breaking the sound barrier, Yeager did it again at the age of 89, riding in a McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle piloted by Captain David Vincent out of Nellis Air Force Base.<ref>Rogers, Keith.

In 1973, Yeager was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame, arguably aviations highest honor. In December 1975, the U.S. Congress awarded Yeager a silver medal "equivalent to a noncombat Medal of Honor ... for contributing immeasurably to aerospace science by risking his life in piloting the X-1 research airplane faster than the speed of sound on {{nowrap October 14}}, 1947." President Gerald Ford presented the medal to Yeager in a ceremony at the White House on {{nowrap December 8}}, 1976.<ref>s:Page:United States Statutes at Large Volume 89.djvu/1094 "Public Law 94-179." United States Statutes. Retrieved: September 10, 2012.</ref>{{refn This is apparently a unique award, as the law that created it states it is equivalent to a noncombat Medal of Honor. It is referred to as a Special Congressional Silver Medal in the Presidents Daily Diary (also see for a list of ceremony attendees).<ref>[http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0036/pdd761208.pdf "The Daily Diary of President Gerald R.

Yeager, who never attended college and was often modest about his background, is considered by many, including Flying Magazine, the California Hall of Fame, the State of West Virginia, National Aviation Hall of Fame, a few U.S. presidents, and the United States Army Air Force, to be one of the greatest pilots of all time. Despite his lack of higher education, he has been honored in his home state. Marshall University has named its highest academic scholarship, the Society of Yeager Scholars, in his honor. Yeager was also the chairman of Experimental Aircraft Associations Young Eagles Young Eagle Program from 1994–2004, and has been named the programs chairman emeritus.<ref>Ford, Harrison.

In 2000, Yeager met actress Victoria Scott DAngelo on a hiking trail in Nevada County. The pair started dating shortly thereafter, and married in August 2003.<ref name=LAT/> Subsequent to the commencement of their relationship, a bitter dispute arose between Yeager, his children and DAngelo. The children contended that DAngelo, 41 years Yeagers junior, had married him for his fortune.  Yeager and DAngelo both denied the charge. Litigation ensued, in which his children accused DAngelo of "undue influence" on Yeager, and Yeager accused his children of diverting hundreds of thousands of dollars from his pension fund.<ref name="Tresniowski"/><ref name=LAT>Hubler, Shawn.
