Longing to be an actor since the age of five, Lamas first studied acting in Tony Barrs Film Actors Workshop and quickly thereafter obtained his first TV acting role in 1976. As a last-minute replacement for Steven Ford, Lamas secured a non-speaking role as a jock in the 1978 film Grease (film) Grease in which he dyed his hair blond.<ref>Gliatto, Tom; and ONeill Anne-Marie. [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20124959,00.html "Grease Is the Word: Twenty Years Later, the Stars Are Still True to Their School"], People (magazine), April 13, 1998. Accessed September 13, 2011. "I always felt Jan was the person most like the audience, says Jamie Donnelly, 50, who dyed her prematurely gray hair to play the pigtailed Pink Lady. She wasnt as cool as the other ones. The Teaneck, N.J., native now lives in La Canada, Calif., with her husband, screenwriter Stephen Foreman, son Sevi, 10, and daughter Madden Rose, 8."</ref> Early in his career, he also had guest-starring roles in Switch (TV series) Switch, Sword of Justice (TV series) Sword of Justice, Dear Detective, Secrets of Midland Heights, Fantasy Island, The Love Boat and Hotel (U.S. TV series) Hotel.<ref name="imdb">{{IMDb name 1444}}</ref>

In 1980, Lamas auditioned for and won the role of Lance Cumson, for the pilot of a new series entitled The Vintage Years. The pilot was later retooled to become the hit prime time drama series Falcon Crest. During a 2006 TV interview with a Norwegian television team, Lamas said that to get the role on Falcon Crest, he had auditioned twice and beat out five other guys for the part. During his stint on Falcon Crest, Lamas was nominated for two Soap Opera Digest Awards and a Golden Globe Award. He was the only actor to appear in all 227 episodes of the series. In an interview, Lamas said that Jane Wymans persona was more of a hard-working legend, not a diva, who referred to her as a friendly woman on Falcon Crest: "With Jane, she expected you to know your lines, but she played poker with the crew at lunch. She was just a great gal; and I think that set the tone for the rest of us. She wasnt a spoiled diva, and believe me, if anybody had a right to be a spoiled diva, it was Jane because she has done so much, Oscar Award-winner, I mean, incredible actress, and she was just like clockwork, right there on time, always knew her lines, always ready to rehearse and she had this great affable quality. You just never talked about (Wymans ex-husband and the then-current U.S. President) Ronald Reagan, thats all. That was one thing we never did; everything else was opened." At the beginning of the ninth and final season of Falcon Crest, off-camera, Lamas received some devastating news about his TV grandmother when she was sent to the hospital that he paid visit to see her to offer her some words of comfort. After cancellation, he kept in touch with her for years; and on September 10, 2007, he lost his TV grandmother and decades-long friend. Prior to Wymans death, Lamas released a statement: "Next to my parents, Jane was the most influential person in my young career," he added, "She has left an incredible body of work and accomplishments that cannot go without being recognized and celebrated. I will miss her greatly."<ref>{{cite web author=Meredy url=http://www.meredy.com/janewyman/janewymanobituary.htm title=Johnny Belinda Actress Jane Wyman Dies publisher=Meredy.com accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref>
