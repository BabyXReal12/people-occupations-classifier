Mathias Rust (born 1 June 1968) is a German aviator known for his illegal landing near Red Square in Moscow on 28 May 1987. An amateur pilot, the teenager flew from Helsinki, Finland, to Moscow, being tracked several times by Soviet air defence and interceptors. The Soviet fighters never received permission to shoot him down, and several times his aeroplane was mistaken for a friendly aircraft. He landed on Vasilevsky Descent next to Red Square near the Moscow Kremlin Kremlin in the capital of the Soviet Union.

Rust said he wanted to create an "imaginary bridge" to Eastern Bloc the East, and he has said that his flight was intended to reduce tension and suspicion between the two Cold War sides.<ref name="airspacemag">{{cite news  last=LeCompte  first=Tom  date=July 2005  title=The Notorious Flight of Mathias Rust  url=http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/the-notorious-flight-of-mathias-rust-7101888/?all  newspaper=Air & Space/Smithsonian  location=Washington, D.C.  publisher=Smithsonian Institution  accessdate=4 April 2009}}</ref><ref name="BBCNews">{{cite news  last=Hadjimatheou  first=Chloe  date=7 December 2012  title=Mathias Rust: German teenager who flew to Red Square  url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20609795  publisher=BBC World Service  accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref>

Rusts flight through a supposedly impenetrable air defence system had great effect on the Soviet military and led to the dismissal of many senior officers, including Minister of Defence (Soviet Union) Minister of Defence Marshal of the Soviet Union Sergey Leonidovich Sokolov Sergei Sokolov and the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Air Defence Forces, former World War II fighter ace pilot Chief Marshal Alexander Koldunov. The incident aided Mikhail Gorbachev in the implementation of Perestroika his reforms, by allowing him to dismiss numerous military officials opposed to his policies. Rust was sentenced to four years in prison (for violation of border crossing and air traffic regulations, and provoking an emergency situation upon his landing). He was officially pardoned by the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Andrei Gromyko, and released after 14 months in prison.<ref name="airspacemag" /><ref name="BBCNews" />

Rust, aged 18, was an inexperienced pilot, with about 50 hours of flying experience at the time of his flight. On 13 May 1987, Rust left Uetersen Airport Uetersen near Hamburg and his home town Wedel in his rented Cessna 172 Reims Cessna F172P D-ECJB, which was modified by removing some of the seats and replacing them with auxiliary fuel tanks. He spent the next two weeks travelling across Northern Europe, visiting the Faroe islands, spending a week in Iceland, and then visiting Bergen on his way back. He was later quoted as saying that he had the idea of attempting to reach Moscow even before the departure, and he saw the trip to Iceland (where he visited Hofdi House, the site of Reykjavík Summit unsuccessful talks between the United States and the Soviet Union in October 1986) as a way to test his piloting skills.<ref name="airspacemag" />

On the morning of 28 May 1987, Rust refuelled at Helsinki-Malmi Airport. He told air traffic control that he was going to Stockholm, and took off at 12:21&nbsp;p.m. Immediately after his final communication with traffic control he turned his plane to the east near Nummela (Vihti) Nummela. Air traffic controllers tried to contact him as he was moving around the busy Helsinki–Moscow route, but Rust turned off all his communications equipment.<ref name="airspacemag"/><ref>{{cite web url = http://www.coptercrazy.scsuk.net/production/rcessna/172/f172-42.htm  title = Listing of Production Reims F172 accessdate = 23 December 2007 last = coptercrazy authorlink =  date = n.d. archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050314122837/http://www.coptercrazy.scsuk.net/production/rcessna/172/f172-42.htm  archivedate = 14 March 2005}}</ref>

Rust disappeared from the Finnish air traffic radar near Espoo.<ref name="airspacemag"/> Control personnel presumed an emergency and a rescue effort was organized, including a Finnish Border Guard patrol boat. They found an oil patch near Sipoo where Rust disappeared from radar, and performed an underwater search with no results.

Rust crossed the Baltic Sea Baltic coastline over Estonia and turned towards Moscow. At 14:29 he appeared on Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO) radar and, after failure to reply to an Identification friend or foe IFF signal, was assigned combat number 8255. Three Surface-to-air missile SAM battalions of 54th Air Defense Corps 54th Air Defence Corps tracked him for some time, but failed to obtain permission to launch at him.<ref>{{Cite news url=https://www.gazeta.ru/army/2017/05/28/10696505.shtml title=Руста прикрыли облака last=Khodarenok first=Mikhail date=28 May 2017 work=Gazeta.ru access-date=25 November 2017 language=Russian trans-title=Rust hidden by clouds}}</ref> All air defences were brought to readiness and two Interceptor aircraft interceptors were sent to investigate. At 14:48 near Gdov one of the pilots observed a white sport plane similar to a Yakovlev Yak-12 and asked for permission to engage, but was denied.<ref name="airspacemag"/>

The fighters lost contact with Rust soon after this. While they were being directed back to him he disappeared from radar near Staraya Russa. West German magazine Bunte speculated that he might have landed there for some time, noting that he changed his clothes during his flight and that he took too much time to fly to Moscow considering his planes speed and the weather conditions.

Air defence re-established contact with Rusts plane several times but confusion followed all of these events. The PVO system had shortly before been divided into several districts, which simplified management but created additional overhead for tracking officers at the districts borders. The local air regiment near Pskov was on maneuvers and, due to inexperienced pilots tendency to forget correct Identification friend or foe IFF designator settings, local control officers assigned all traffic in the area friendly status, including Rust.<ref name="airspacemag"/>

Near Torzhok there was a similar situation, as increased air traffic was created by a rescue effort for an air crash the previous day. Rust, flying a slow propeller-driven aircraft, was confused with one of the helicopters taking part in the rescue. He was spotted several more times and given false friendly recognition twice. Rust was considered as a domestic training plane defying regulations, and was issued least priority.<ref name="airspacemag"/>

Around 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Rust appeared above Moscow. He had initially intended to land in the Moscow Kremlin Kremlin, but he reasoned that landing inside, hidden by the Kremlin walls, would have allowed the KGB to arrest him and deny the incident. Therefore, he changed his landing spot to Red Square.<ref name="airspacemag"/> Heavy pedestrian traffic did not allow him to land there either, so after circling about the square one more time, he was able to land on Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge by St. Basils Cathedral. A later inquiry found that trolleybus wires normally strung over the bridge—which would have  prevented his landing there—had been removed for maintenance that morning, and were replaced the next day.<ref name="airspacemag"/> After taxiing past the cathedral he stopped about {{convert 100 m}} from the square, where he was greeted by curious passersby and was asked for autographs. When asked where he was from, he replied "Germany" making the bystanders think he was from East Germany; but when he said West Germany, they were surprised.<ref name=FAZ/> A British doctor videotaped Rust circling over Red Square and landing on the bridge.<ref name=FAZ/> Rust was arrested two hours later.<ref>{{cite news  last=Rehrmann  first=Marc-Oliver  date=26 June 2009  title=Der Kremlflieger Mathias Rust kehrt zurück  trans-title=The Kremlin Flyer Mathias Rust returns  url=http://www.ndr.de/geschichte/mathiasrust2.html  language=German  location=Hamburg  publisher=Norddeutscher Rundfunk  accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref>

==Aftermath==

Rusts trial began in Moscow on 2 September 1987. He was sentenced to four years in a general-regime labour camp for hooliganism, for disregard of aviation laws, and for breaching the Soviet border.<ref>{{cite news  last=Barringer  first=Felicity  date=9 December 1987  title=German in Red Square Flight Is Denied a Pardon  url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/09/world/german-in-red-square-flight-is-denied-a-pardon.html  newspaper=The New York Times  accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref> He was never transferred to a labour camp, and instead served his time at the high security Lefortovo Prison Lefortovo temporary detention facility in Moscow. Two months later, Reagan and Gorbachev agreed to sign a Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty treaty to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe, and the Supreme Soviet ordered Rust to be released in August 1988 as a goodwill gesture to the Western Bloc West.<ref name="airspacemag" />

Rusts return to Germany on 3 August 1988 was accompanied by huge media attention, but he did not talk to the assembled journalists; his family had sold the exclusive rights to the story to the German magazine Stern (magazine) Stern for Deutsche Mark DM 100,000.<ref name=FAZ /> He reported that he had been treated well in the Soviet prison. Journalists described him as "psychologically unstable and unworldly in a dangerous manner".<ref name=FAZ />

William Eldridge Odom William E. Odom, former director of the U.S. National Security Agency and author of The Collapse of the Soviet Military, says that Rusts flight irreparably damaged the reputation of the Soviet military. This enabled Gorbachev to remove many of the strongest opponents to his reforms. Minister of Defence Sergey Sokolov (commander) Sergei Sokolov and the head of the Soviet Air Defence Forces Alexander Koldunov were dismissed along with hundreds of other officers. This was the biggest turnover in the Soviet military since Great Purge Stalins purges 50 years earlier.<ref name="airspacemag" /><ref>{{Cite journal   doi = 10.1080/14682740701197631  title = Perestroika and the End of the Cold War  journal = Cold War History  volume = 7  pages = 1  year = 2007  last1 = Brown   first1 = A. }}</ref>

==Later life==
While doing his obligatory community service (Zivildienst) in a West German hospital in 1989, Rust stabbed a female co-worker who had rejected him. The victim barely survived. He was convicted of attempted manslaughter and sentenced to two and a half years in prison, but was released after 15 months.<ref name = "wz"/> Since then he has lived a fragmented life, describing himself as a "bit of an oddball."<ref name="guardianmay14" /> After being released from court, he converted to Hinduism in 1996 to become engaged to a daughter of an Indian tea merchant.<ref>{{cite news  last=Connolly  first=Kate  date=21 April 2001  title=German daredevil grounded by court  url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/21/kateconnolly  newspaper=The Guardian  location=London  accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref> In 2001, he was convicted of stealing a cashmere wool cashmere pullover and ordered to pay a fine of Deutsche Mark DM 10,000, which was later reduced to DM 600.<ref name=FAZ>{{cite news  last=Locke  first=Stefan  date=12 May 2012  title=Der lange Irrflug der Friedenstaube  trans-title=The long erratic flight of the peace dove  url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/kreml-flieger-mathias-rust-der-lange-irrflug-der-friedenstaube-11749475.html  language=German  newspaper=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  location=Frankfurt  accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref><ref name = "wz"/> A further brush with the law came in 2005, when he was convicted of fraud and had to pay €1,500 for stolen goods.<ref name="wz">{{cite news  last1=Krüger  first1=Ralf E.  last2=Grages  first2=Anna  date=25 May 2007  title=Moskau-Flug: Der Kremlflieger pokert hoch  trans-title=The Kremlin Flyer raises the stakes  url=http://www.wz-newsline.de/home/gesellschaft/leute/moskau-flug-der-kremlflieger-pokert-hoch-1.465404  language=German  newspaper=Westdeutsche Zeitung accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref>  In 2009 Rust described himself as a professional poker player.<ref name="spiegel">{{cite news  author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  date=6 June 2009  title=Kreml-Flieger Rust: "750.000 Euro beim Pokern gewonnen"  trans-title=Kremlin Flyer Rust: "I won 750,000 Euros playing poker"  url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leute/kreml-flieger-rust-750-000-euro-beim-pokern-gewonnen-a-628964.html  language=German  newspaper=Spiegel Online  accessdate=6 June 2009}}</ref> Most recently, in 2012, he described himself as an Financial analyst analyst at a Zurich-based investment bank.<ref name="guardianmay14">{{cite news  last=Connolly  first=Kate  date=14 May 2012  title=German who flew to Red Square during cold war admits it was irresponsible  url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/14/german-red-square-cold-war  newspaper=The Guardian  location=London  accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref>

=== Peace activism ===

In October 2015, The Hindu published an interview with Mathias Rust to mark the 25th anniversary of German reunification. Mathias Rust surmised that Government failure institutional failures in Western countries to preserve moral standards and uphold the primacy of democratic ideals was creating mistrust between peoples and governments. Pointing to the genesis of a Cold War II New Cold War between Russia and the Western powers, Mathias Rust suggested that India should tread with caution and avoid entanglement: "India will be better served if it follows a policy of neutrality while interacting with EU member countries as the big European powers at present are following the foreign policy of the U.S. unquestioningly". Mathias Rust drew attention to the casus belli which is fuelling Euroscepticism: "Governments have been dominated by the corporate entities and citizens have ceased to matter in public policy".<ref>{{cite news title=contributed to ending the Cold War, with his daring url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cold-war-is-back-peace-activist/article7720749.ece newspaper=The Hindu date=4 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news title=The Teenage Pilot Who Could Have Caused a Global Crisis url=http://time.com/3889327/drones-mathias-rust-red-square/ magazine=Time (magazine) Time date=28 May 2015}}</ref>

== In popular culture ==
Because Rusts flight seemed like a blow to the authority of the Soviet regime, it was the source of numerous jokes and urban legends. For a while after the incident, Red Square was jokingly referred to by Muscovites as Sheremetyevo-3 (Sheremetyevo-1 and -2 being the two terminals at Moscows main international airport).<ref>{{cite news  last=Bushansky  first=Valentin  date=28 May 2008  title=10 фактов о Матиасе Русте ко Дню пограничника  trans-title=10 Facts about Mathias Rust on Border Guards Day  url=http://fraza.ua/news/28.05.08/51446.html  language=Russian  publisher=Fraza  accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref>  At the end of 1987, the Ten-code police radio code used by law enforcement officers in Moscow was allegedly updated to include a code for an aircraft landing.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.internet-law.ru/info/humour/mb15.htm script-title=ru:Милицейские байки. 15-й десяток language=Russian}}</ref>

Shortly after the incident, SubLogic, the original publishers of the Microsoft Flight Simulator Flight Simulator franchise, issued a scenery disk that expanded the original programs coverage area to include the Eastern Bloc. A challenge in the expansion pack was to land in Red Square as Rust had just done.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/scenery-disk-western-european-tour  title=Scenery Disk "Western European Tour"  author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  publisher=MobyGames  accessdate=16 March 2014}}</ref>

==In the media==
Following the 20th anniversary of his flight on 28 May 2007, the international media interviewed Rust about the flight and its aftermath.

The Washington Post and Bild both have online editions of their interviews.<ref>{{cite news  last=Finn  first=Peter  date=27 May 2007  title=A Dubious Diplomat  url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/26/AR2007052601262.html  newspaper=The Washington Post  accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref> The most comprehensive televised interview available online is produced by the DR (broadcaster) Danish Broadcasting Corporation.
