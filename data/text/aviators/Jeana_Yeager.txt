Jeana and Dick Rutan decided to attempt to fly around the world without refueling. They formed Voyager Aircraft, Inc., and Burt Rutan began designing the aircraft. Initially unable to find a commercial sponsor, Jeana started the Voyager Impressive People (VIP) program which became the major source of money to build, test, and fly the aircraft. By mid-1986, Voyager was ready for the flight. She flew as copilot on the 216-hour flight and set a worlds absolute distance record. And, it was the first time a woman had been listed in an absolute category.

==Awards==
In recognition of the Voyager flight, she received the Harmon Trophy, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale FAI De la Vaulx Medal, the Presidential Citizens Medal from President Ronald Reagan (1986) and is the first woman to have received the Collier Trophy--receiving the latter two honors along with Dick and Burt Rutan.  She was also awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1988.<ref name="LongstrethMedal_Laureates">{{cite web url=https://www.fi.edu/laureates/jeana-yeager  title=Jeanna Yeager  publisher=Franklin Institute  accessdate=April 24, 2017}}</ref>
