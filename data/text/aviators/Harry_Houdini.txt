Harry Houdini (born Erik Weisz, later Ehrich Weiss or Harry Weiss; March 24, 1874 – October 31, 1926) was a Hungarian-born American  illusionist and stunt performer, noted for his sensational Escapology escape acts. He first attracted notice in vaudeville in the US and then as "Harry Handcuff Houdini" on a tour of Europe, where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up. Soon he extended his repertoire to include chains, ropes slung from skyscrapers, straitjackets under water, and having to escape from and apnea hold his breath inside a sealed milk can with water in it.

In 1904, thousands watched as he tried to escape from special handcuffs commissioned by Londons Daily Mirror, keeping them in suspense for an hour. Another stunt saw him Premature burial buried alive and only just able to claw himself to the surface, emerging in a state of near-breakdown. While many suspected that these escapes were faked, Houdini presented himself as the scourge of fake spiritualists. As President of the Society of American Magicians, he was keen to uphold professional standards and expose fraudulent artists. He was also quick to sue anyone who imitated his escape stunts.

Houdini made several movies, but quit acting when it failed to bring in money. He was also a keen aviator, and aimed to become the first man to fly a plane in Australia.

==Early life==
Erik Weisz was born in Budapest to a Jewish family.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2011/03/137-years-ago-in-budapest.html  title=137 years ago in Budapest... publisher=Wild About Harry  accessdate=March 24, 2011}}</ref> His parents were Rabbi Mayer Sámuel Weisz (1829–1892) and Cecília Steiner (1841–1913). Houdini was one of seven children: Herman M. (1863–1885) who was Houdinis half-brother, by Rabbi Weiszs first marriage; Nathan J. (1870–1927); Gottfried William (1872–1925); Theodore Hardeen Theodore (1876–1945);<ref>{{cite news  title=Hardeen Dead, 69. Houdinis Brother. Illusionist, Escape Artist, a Founder of Magicians Guild.

Weisz arrived in the United States on July 3, 1878, on the SS Fresia with his mother (who was pregnant) and his four brothers.<ref>US National Archives Microfilm serial: M237; Microfilm roll: 413; Line: 38; List number: 684.</ref> The family changed their name to the German spelling Weiss, and Erik became Ehrich. The family lived in Appleton, Wisconsin, where his father served as Rabbi of the Zion Reform Jewish Congregation.

According to the 1880 US Census 1880 census, the family lived on Appleton Street.<ref>1880 US Census with Samuel M. Weiss, Cecelia (wife), Armin M.<!-- Is this supposed to be Herman? -->, Nathan J., Ehrich, Theodore, and Leopold.</ref> On June 6, 1882, Rabbi Weiss became an American citizen. Losing his job at Zion in 1882, Rabbi Weiss and family moved to Milwaukee and fell into dire poverty.<ref>http://www.houdinifile.com/2014/02/houdinis-forgotten-years.html</ref> In 1887, Rabbi Weiss moved with Ehrich to New York City, where they lived in a boarding house on 79th Street (Manhattan) East 79th Street. He was joined by the rest of the family once Rabbi Weiss found permanent housing. As a child, Ehrich Weiss took several jobs, making his public début as a 9-year-old trapeze artist, calling himself "Ehrich, the Prince of the Air". He was also a champion cross country running cross country runner in his youth. When Weiss became a professional magic (illusion) magician he began calling himself "Harry Houdini", after the French magician Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, after reading Robert-Houdins autobiography in 1890. Weiss incorrectly believed that an i at the end of a name meant "like" in French. In later life, Houdini claimed that the first part of his new name, Harry, was an homage to Harry Kellar, whom he also admired, though it was more likely adapted from "Ehri," a nickname for "Ehrich," which is how he was known to his family.<ref>{{cite web url=http://taramarion.vpweb.com/upload/Harry%20Houdini.pdf title=Harry Houdini publisher=American Decades date=December 16, 1998 accessdate=February 4, 2016}} Also at [http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?zid=2a3b8a0573f3c6eeab667966408317da&action=2&catId=&documentId=GALE%7CK1602000557&userGroupName=tlc199095657&jsid=8d70ce38fc654bb5c3842e043b6782b7 Biography In Context].</ref> When he was a teenager, Houdini was coached by the magician Joseph Rinn at the Pastime Athletic Club.<ref name="Loxton 2013">{{cite web last=Loxton first=Daniel authorlink=Daniel Loxton title=The Remarkable Mr. Rinn  date=January 30, 2013  url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/13-01-30/#feature   publisher=Skeptic (U.S. magazine) Skeptic Magazine   accessdate=January 16, 2016 }}</ref>

In 1893, while performing with his brother "Theodore Hardeen Dash" (Theodore) at Coney Island as "The Brothers Houdini", Houdini met a fellow performer, Bess Houdini Wilhelmina Beatrice "Bess" Rahner. Bess was initially courted by Dash, but she and Houdini married in 1894, with Bess replacing Dash in the act, which became known as "The Houdinis". For the rest of Houdinis performing career, Bess worked as his stage assistant.

Houdinis big break came in 1899 when he met manager Martin Beck (vaudeville) Martin Beck in St. Paul, Minnesota. Impressed by Houdinis handcuffs act, Beck advised him to concentrate on escape acts and booked him on the Orpheum Circuit Orpheum vaudeville circuit. Within months, he was performing at the top vaudeville houses in the country. In 1900, Beck arranged for Houdini to tour Europe. After some days of unsuccessful interviews in London, Houdinis British agent Harry Day (politician) Harry Day helped him to get an interview with C. Dundas Slater, then manager of the Alhambra Theatre.

Houdini became widely known as "The Handcuff King." He toured England, Scotland, the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Russia. In each city, Houdini challenged local police to restrain him with shackles and lock him in their jails. In many of these challenge escapes, he was first strip search stripped nude and searched. In Moscow, he escaped from a Siberian prison transport van, claiming that, had he been unable to free himself, he would have had to travel to Siberia, where the only key was kept. In Cologne, he sued a police officer, Werner Graff, who alleged that he made his escapes via bribery.<ref>Silverman, p. 81.</ref> Houdini won the case when he opened the judges safe (he later said the judge had forgotten to lock it). With his new-found wealth, Houdini purchased a dress said to have been made for Queen Victoria. He then arranged a grand reception where he presented his mother in the dress to all their relatives. Houdini said it was the happiest day of his life. In 1904, Houdini returned to the U.S. and purchased a house for $25,000 ({{Inflation US 25000 1904 fmt=eq}}), a brownstone at 278&nbsp;W. 113th Street in Harlem, New York City.<ref>Silverman, p. 109.</ref>

Whilst on tour in Europe in 1902, Houdini visited Blois with the aim of meeting the widow of Emile Houdin, the son of Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, for an interview and permission to visit his grave. He did not receive permission but still visited the grave.<ref name="Steinmeyer 152-153">Jim Steinmeyer Steinmeyer, Jim. (2004). Hiding The Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible.

Holt. p. 136</ref> It was a competitor to The Sphinx: An Independent Magazine for Magicians The Sphinx, but was short-lived and only two volumes were released until August 1908.

From 1907 and throughout the 1910s, Houdini performed with great success in the United States. He freed himself from jails, handcuffs, chains, ropes, and straitjackets, often while hanging from a rope in sight of street audiences. Because of imitators, Houdini put his "handcuff act" behind him on January 25, 1908, and began escaping from a locked, water-filled milk can. The possibility of failure and death thrilled his audiences. Houdini also expanded his repertoire with his escape challenge act, in which he invited the public to devise contraptions to hold him. These included nailed packing crates (sometimes lowered into water), riveted boilers, wet sheets, mail bags,<ref>{{cite book  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_-UQ8pUg_4C&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=Houdini+Mailbag+escape#v=onepage&q=Houdini%20Mailbag%20escape&f=false  first1=J.

Many of these challenges were arranged with local merchants in one of the first uses of mass tie-in marketing. Rather than promote the idea that he was assisted by spirits, as did the Davenport Brothers and others, Houdinis advertisements showed him making his escapes via Teleportation dematerializing, although Houdini himself never claimed to have supernatural powers.<ref name="secret">{{cite book  last1=Kalush  first1=William  first2=Larry  last2=Sloman  date=October 2006  title=The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of Americas First Superhero  publisher=Simon & Schuster  isbn=978-0-7432-7207-0  url=https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Life-Houdini-Americas-Superhero/dp/0743272080/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1447089136&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Secret+Life+of+Houdini%3A+The+Making+of+America%27s+First+Superhero&pebp=1447089139631&perid=085T6DT7FGGR0YVZRS7Y#reader_0743272080  accessdate=November 9, 2015  subscription=yes}}</ref>

After much research, Houdini wrote a collection of articles on the history of magic, which were expanded into The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin published in 1908. In this book he attacked his former idol Robert-Houdin as liar and a fraud for having claimed the invention of automata and effects such as Aerial suspension (illusion) aerial suspension, which had been in existence for many years.<ref>Jim Steinmeyer Steinmeyer, Jim. (2004). Hiding The Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible.

Houdini had developed a hatred for his spiritual father. In 1908 his collection of articles was gathered together, expanded and sold to a London publisher. By comparing the original articles with the finished book, its clear that Houdini employed a ghost writer to polish the language and clarify his points. Other surviving manuscripts from Houdini demonstrate that most of Houdinis writing depended on ghostwriters. The theme of his book on Robert-Houdin was sharpened to a razors edge, and was now titled The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin."</ref><ref>Goto-Jones, Chris. (2016). Conjuring Asia.

In 1913, Houdini introduced the Chinese Water Torture Cell, in which he was suspended upside-down in a locked glass-and-steel cabinet full to overflowing with water, holding his breath for more than three minutes. He would go on performing this escape for the rest of his life.

During his career, Houdini explained some of his tricks in books written for the magic brotherhood. In Handcuff Secrets (1909), he revealed how many locks and handcuffs could be opened with properly applied force, others with shoestrings. Other times, he carried concealed lock picking lockpicks or keys. When tied down in ropes or straitjackets, he gained wiggle room by enlarging his shoulders and chest, moving his arms slightly away from his Human body body.<ref name="secret"/>

His straitjacket escape was originally performed behind curtains, with him popping out free at the end. Houdinis brother, (who was also an escape artist, billing himself as Theodore Hardeen), discovered that audiences were more impressed when the curtains were eliminated so they could watch him struggle to get out. On more than one occasion, they both performed straitjacket escapes while dangling upside-down from the roof of a building in the same city.<ref name="secret"/>

For most of his career, Houdini was a headline act in vaudeville. For many years, he was the highest-paid performer in American vaudeville. One of Houdinis most notable non-escape stage illusions was performed at the New York Hippodrome, when he vanished a full-grown elephant from the stage.<ref>[http://www.thegreatharryhoudini.com/vanishingelephant.html "The Vanishing Elephant"].

Retrieved June 30, 2016.</ref> In 1923, Houdini became president of Martinka & Co., Americas oldest magic company. The business is still in operation today.

He also served as President of the Society of American Magicians ({{aka}} S.A.M.) from 1917 until his death in 1926. Founded on May 10, 1902, in the back room of Martinkas magic shop in New York, the Society expanded under the leadership of Harry Houdini during his term as National President from 1917 to 1926. Houdini was magics greatest visionary. He sought to create a large, unified national network of professional and amateur magicians. Wherever he traveled, he gave a lengthy formal address to the local magic club, made speeches, and usually threw a banquet for the members at his own expense. He said "The Magicians Clubs as a rule are small: they are weak...but if we were amalgamated into one big body the society would be stronger, and it would mean making the small clubs powerful and worthwhile. Members would find a welcome wherever they happened to be and, conversely, the safeguard of a city-to-city hotline to track exposers and other undesirables."

For most of 1916, while on his vaudeville tour, Houdini had been recruiting&mdash;at his own expense&mdash;local magic clubs to join the S.A.M. in an effort to revitalize what he felt was a weak organization. Houdini persuaded groups in Buffalo, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City to join. As had happened in London, he persuaded magicians to join. The Buffalo club joined as the first branch, (later assembly) of the Society. Chicago Assembly No. 3 was, as the name implies, the third regional club to be established by the S.A.M., whose assemblies now number in the hundreds. In 1917, he signed Assembly Number Threes charter into existence, and that charter and this club continue to provide Chicago magicians with a connection to each other and to their past. Houdini dined with, addressed, and got pledges from similar clubs in Detroit, Rochester, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Cincinnati and elsewhere. This was the biggest movement ever in the history of magic. In places where no clubs existed, he rounded up individual magicians, introduced them to each other, and urged them into the fold.

By the end of 1916, magicians clubs in San Francisco and other cities that Houdini had not visited were offering to become assemblies. He had created the richest and longest-surviving organization of magicians in the world. It now embraces almost 6,000 dues-paying members and almost 300 assemblies worldwide. In July 1926, Houdini was elected for the ninth successive time President of the Society of American Magicians. Every other president has only served for one year. He also was President of the Magicians Club of London.<ref name="Houdini!">{{cite book  first=Kenneth  last=Silverman  title=Houdini!

==Notable escapes==

===Mirror  challenge===
File:HandCuffHarryHoudini.jpg thumb left upright "Handcuff" Harry Houdini, c. 1905
In 1904, the London Daily Mirror newspaper challenged Houdini to escape from special handcuffs that it claimed had taken Nathaniel Hart, a locksmith from Birmingham, five years to make. Houdini accepted the challenge for March 17 during a matinée performance at Londons Hippodrome theater. It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event. The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his "ghost house" (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times. On one occasion he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take off his coat. The Mirror representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked. Houdini promptly took out a pen-knife and, holding the knife in his teeth, used it to cut his coat from his body. Some 56&nbsp;minutes later, Houdinis wife appeared on stage and gave him a kiss. Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs. However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due to the size of the 6-inch key<ref>The Secret Life of Houdini, Kaulush & Sloman, 2006.</ref> Houdini then went back behind the curtain. After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free. As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept. Houdini later said it was the most difficult escape of his career.<ref>{{cite web  title=Houdinis Mirror Handcuff Challenge, Getting Closer to the Truth  first=Mick  last=Hanzlik  year=2007  quote=reproduction in full of Daily Mirror article "Houdinis Great Victory" March 18, 1904  url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/09/mick-hanzlik-completes-mirror-handcuff.html}}</ref>

After Houdinis death, his friend Martin Beck was quoted in Will Goldstons book, Sensational Tales of Mystery Men, as admitting that Houdini was bested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help. Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the Mirror representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book The Secret Life of Houdini that the key required to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was 6 inches long, and could not have been smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the Mirror challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship.<ref>Silverman, pp.&nbsp;59–62.</ref>

This escape was discussed in depth on the Travel Channels Mysteries at the Museum in an interview with Houdini expert, magician and escape artist Dorothy Dietrich of Scrantons Houdini Museum.<ref name=mysteries>{{cite web  title=Keys To Houdinis Secrets  publisher=Travel Channel  series=Mysteries at the Museum  date=November 23, 2010  accessdate=November 9, 2015  url=http://www.travelchannel.com/shows/mysteries-at-the-museum/video/the-secret-to-houdini-s-tricks}}</ref>

===Milk Can Escape===
In 1908, Houdini introduced his own original act, the Milk Can Escape.<ref>Randi, pp. 175–178.</ref> In this act, Houdini was handcuffed and sealed inside an oversized milk can filled with water and made his escape behind a curtain. As part of the effect, Houdini invited members of the audience to hold their breath along with him while he was inside the can. Advertised with dramatic posters that proclaimed "Failure Means A Drowning Death", the escape proved to be a sensation.<ref>Randi, Milk Can poster on page&nbsp;177.</ref> Houdini soon modified the escape to include the milk can being locked inside a wooden chest, being chained or padlocked. Houdini performed the milk can escape as a regular part of his act for only four years, but it has remained one of the acts most associated with him. Houdinis brother, Theodore Hardeen, continued to perform the milk can escape and its wooden chest variant<ref>{{cite book  last=Christopher  first=Milbourne  title=Houdini: A Pictorial Life  date=October 1976  isbn=978-0690011524  page=54  publisher=Ty Crowell Co.}}</ref> into the 1940s.

===Chinese water torture cell===
{{main Chinese Water Torture Cell}}

Around 1912, the vast number of imitators prompted Houdini to replace his milk can act with the Chinese water torture cell. In this escape, Houdinis feet were locked in stocks, and he was lowered upside down into a tank filled with water. The mahogany and metal cell featured a glass front, through which audiences could clearly see Houdini. The stocks were locked to the top of the cell, and a curtain concealed his escape. In the earliest version of the torture cell, a metal cage was lowered into the cell, and Houdini was enclosed inside that. While making the escape more difficult – the cage prevented Houdini from turning – the cage bars also offered protection should the front glass break. The original cell was built in England, where Houdini first performed the escape for an audience of one person as part of a one-act play he called "Houdini Upside Down". This was so he could copyright the effect and have grounds to sue imitators, which he did. While the escape was advertised as "The Chinese Water Torture Cell" or "The Water Torture Cell", Houdini always referred to it as "the Upside Down" or "USD". The first public performance of the USD was at the Circus Busch in Berlin, on September 21, 1912. Houdini continued to perform the escape until his death in 1926.<ref name="secret"/>

===Suspended straitjacket escape===
One of Houdinis most popular publicity stunts was to have himself strapped into a regulation straitjacket and suspended by his ankles from a tall building or crane. Houdini would then make his Straitjacket#Escape techniques escape in full view of the assembled crowd. In many cases, Houdini drew tens of thousands of onlookers who brought city traffic to a halt. Houdini would sometimes ensure press coverage by performing the escape from the office building of a local newspaper. In New York City, Houdini performed the suspended straitjacket escape from a crane being used to build the New York subway. After flinging his body in the air, he escaped from the straitjacket. Starting from when he was hoisted up in the air by the crane, to when the straitjacket was completely off, it took him two minutes and thirty-seven seconds. There is film footage in the Library of Congress of Houdini performing the escape.<ref>"[http://lccn.loc.gov/94505242 Thousands see Harry Houdini escape from a straitjacket while hanging in mid-air, Chicago, Ill.]", International news [1923 or 1924?]</ref> Films of his escapes are also shown at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, PA. After being battered against a building in high winds during one escape, Houdini performed the escape with a visible safety wire on his ankle so that he could be pulled away from the building if necessary. The idea for the upside-down escape was given to Houdini by a young boy named Randolph Osborne Douglas (March 31, 1895&nbsp;– December 5, 1956), when the two met at a performance at Sheffields Empire Theatre.<ref name="secret"/>

===Overboard box escape===
File:HoudiniSubmergedCrate.jpg thumb left Houdini prepares to do the overboard box escape c. 1912
Another of Houdinis most famous publicity stunts was to escape from a nailed and roped packing crate after it had been lowered into water. He first performed the escape in New Yorks East River on July 7, 1912. Police forbade him from using one of the piers, so he hired a tugboat and invited press on board. Houdini was locked in handcuffs and leg-irons, then nailed into the crate which was roped and weighed down with two hundred pounds of lead. The crate was then lowered into the water. He escaped in 57 seconds. The crate was pulled to the surface and found still to be intact, with the manacles inside.

Houdini performed this escape many times, and even performed a version on stage, first at Hamersteins Roof Garden where a {{convert 5,500 USgal l adj=on}} tank was specially built, and later at the New York Hippodrome.<ref>{{cite book  title=Houdini His Legend and His Magic  last=Henning  first=Doug  authorlink=Doug Henning  date=December 1, 1977  publisher=Times Books  page=1960  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtMTAQAAIAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=hamerstein%27s+roof  subscription=yes}}</ref>

===Buried alive stunt===
Houdini performed at least three variations on a Premature burial buried alive stunt during his career. The first was near Santa Ana, California in 1915, and it almost cost Houdini his life. Houdini was buried, without a casket, in a pit of earth six feet deep. He became exhausted and panicked while trying to dig his way to the surface and called for help. When his hand finally broke the surface, he fell unconscious and had to be pulled from the grave by his assistants. Houdini wrote in his diary that the escape was "very dangerous" and that "the weight of the earth is killing."<ref>{{cite book  last=Christopher  first=Milbourne  title=Houdini: The Untold Story  date=1969  isbn=978-0891909811  page=140  publisher=Ty Crowell Co.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2011/01/digging-into-buried-alive.html  title=Digging into Houdinis Buried Alive  accessdate=January 6, 2011}}</ref>

Houdinis second variation on buried alive was an endurance test designed to expose mystical Egyptian performer Rahman Bey, who had claimed to use supernatural powers to remain in a sealed casket for an hour. Houdini bettered Bey on August 5, 1926, by remaining in a sealed casket, or coffin, submerged in the swimming pool of New Yorks Hotel Shelton for one and a half hours. Houdini claimed he did not use any trickery or supernatural powers to accomplish this feat, just controlled breathing.<ref>Silverman, pp.&nbsp;397–403.</ref> He repeated the feat at the YMCA in Worcester, Massachusetts on September 28, 1926, this time remaining sealed for one hour and eleven minutes.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/01/uncovering-houdinis-forgotten-second.html  title=Uncovering Houdinis second underwater test  accessdate=January 26, 2010}}</ref>

Houdinis final buried alive was an elaborate stage escape that featured in his full evening show. Houdini would escape after being strapped in a straitjacket, sealed in a casket, and then buried in a large tank filled with sand. While posters advertising the escape exist (playing off the Bey challenge by boasting "Egyptian Fakirs Outdone!"), it is unclear whether Houdini ever performed buried alive on stage. The stunt was to be the feature escape of his 1927 season, but Houdini died on October 31, 1926. The bronze casket Houdini created for buried alive was used to transport Houdinis body from Detroit to New York following his death on Halloween.<ref>Silverman, p. 406.</ref>

In 1906, Houdini started showing films of his outside escapes as part of his vaudeville act. In Boston, he presented a short film called Houdini Defeats Hackenschmidt. Georg Hackenschmidt was a famous wrestler of the day, but the nature of their contest is unknown as the film is lost.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/01/houdini-defeats-hackenschmidt-and-other.html  title=Houdini Defeats Hackenschmidt and other revelations from Disappearing Tricks  accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref> In 1909, Houdini made a film in Paris for Cinema Lux titled Merveilleux Exploits du Célébre Houdini à Paris (Marvellous Exploits of the Famous Houdini in Paris).<ref>Disappearing Tricks by Matthew Solomon, 2010, p. 95.</ref> It featured a loose narrative designed to showcase several of Houdinis famous escapes, including his straitjacket and underwater handcuff escapes. That same year Houdini got an offer to star as Captain Nemo in a silent version of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, but the project never made it into production.<ref>Silverman, p. 205.</ref>
It is often erroneously reported that Houdini served as special-effects consultant on the Wharton/International cliffhanger serial, The Mysteries of Myra, shot in Ithaca, New York, because Harry Grossman, director of The Master Mystery also filmed a serial in Ithaca at about the same time. The consultants on the serial were pioneering Hereward Carrington and Aleister Crowley.<ref>{{cite book  last1=Stedman  first1=Eric  title=The Mysteries of Myra  year=2010  page=8}}</ref>

In 1918, Houdini signed a contract with film producer B. A. Rolfe to star in a 15-part serial (film) serial, The Master Mystery (released in November 1918). As was common at the time, the film serial was released simultaneously with a novel. Financial difficulties resulted in Rolfe Photoplays Inc. B. A. Rolfe Productions going out of business, but The Master Mystery led to Houdini being signed by Famous Players-Lasky Corporation/Paramount Pictures, for whom he made two pictures, The Grim Game (1919) and Terror Island (1920).<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/12/adroit-harry-and-ancient-hokum.html  title=Adroit Harry and ancient hokum  accessdate=December 30, 2012}}</ref>

The Grim Game was Houdinis first full-length movie and is reputed to be his best. Because of the flammable nature of nitrate film and the inherent chemical instability of the Safety film#Decay and the .22vinegar syndrome.22 acetate "safety" film that supplanted it, only 10 percent of old silent movies exist. Film historians considered the film lost. One copy did exist hidden in the collection of a private collector only known to a tiny group of magicians that saw it. Dick Brookz and Dorothy Dietrich of The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania had seen it twice on the invitation of the collector. After many years of trying, they finally got him to agree to sell the film to Turner Classic Movies<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.turner.com/pressroom/tcm-fest-present-lost-houdini-film  title=Turner Classic Movies to Host World Premiere Screening of Long Lost Harry Houdini Classic The Grim Game at 2015 TCM Classic Film Festival  date=January 23, 2015  publisher=TCM  accessdate=November 9, 2015}}</ref> who restored the complete 71-minute film.

While filming an aerial stunt for The Grim Game, two biplanes collided in mid-air with a stuntman doubling Houdini dangling by a rope from one of the planes. Publicity was geared heavily toward promoting this dramatic "caught on film" moment, claiming it was Houdini himself dangling from the plane. While filming these movies in Los Angeles, Houdini rented a home in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California Laurel Canyon. Following his two-picture stint in Hollywood, Houdini returned to New York and started his own film production company called the "Houdini Picture Corporation". He produced and starred in two films, The Man from Beyond (1921) and Haldane of the Secret Service (1923). He also founded his own film laboratory business called The Film Development Corporation (FDC), gambling on a new process for developing motion picture film. Houdinis brother, Theodore Hardeen, left his own career as a magician and escape artist to run the company. Magician Harry Kellar was a major investor.<ref>Silverman, pp. 226–249.</ref>

Neither Houdinis acting career nor FDC found success, and he gave up on the movie business in 1923, complaining that "the profits are too meager".

In April 2008, Kino International released a DVD box set of Houdinis surviving silent films, including The Master Mystery, Terror Island, The Man From Beyond, Haldane of the Secret Service, and five minutes from The Grim Game. The set also includes newsreel footage of Houdinis escapes from 1907 to 1923, and a section from Merveilleux Exploits du Célébre Houdini à Paris, although it is not identified as such.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2008/04/houdini-movie-star-dvd-collection.html  title=Houdini The Movie Star DVD collection released  accessdate=April 8, 2008}}</ref>

==Aviator==
In 1909, Houdini became fascinated with aviation. He purchased a French Voisin 1907 biplane Voisin biplane for $5,000 and hired a full-time mechanic, Antonio Brassac. After crashing once, he made his first successful flight on November 26 in Hamburg, Germany. The following year, Houdini toured Australia. He brought along his Voisin biplane with the intention to be the first person in Australia to fly.

=== Falsely reported as pioneer ===
On March 18, 1910, he made three flights at Diggers Rest, Victoria, near Melbourne. It was reported at the time that this was the first aerial flight in Australia,<ref>{{cite news  url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=EP19100319.2.62  work=The Evening Post (New Zealand) The Evening Post  location=Wellington  date=March 19, 1910  title=AERIAL FLIGHT IN AUSTRALIA  volume=LXXIX  issue=66  agency=Press Association  accessdate=November 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name=smh>{{cite news  url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/houdinis-australian-dream-one-for-the-record-books/2008/05/09/1210131263951.html  title=Houdinis Australian dream: one for the record books  work=Sydney Morning Herald  date=May 10, 2008  first=Max  last=Prisk  accessdate=November 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.aarg.com.au/Aviation-EarlyAustralian.htm  title=Australian National Aviation Museum&nbsp;– Early Australian Aviation  publisher=Aarg.com.au  accessdate=April 1, 2011  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719022731/http://www.aarg.com.au/Aviation-EarlyAustralian.htm  archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}</ref> and a century later, some major news outlets still credit him with this feat.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/10/31/sunday/main7008518.shtml  title=The Art and Magic of Harry Houdini  work=CBS News  date=November 2, 2010  accessdate=November 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/article/2010/03/18/166815_entertainment-news.html Entertainment Houdinis flight into history].

Wing Commander Harry Cobby wrote in Aircraft in March 1938 that "the first aeroplane flight in the Southern Hemisphere was made on December 9, 1909 by Mr Colin Defries, a Londoner, at Victoria Park Racecourse, Sydney, in a Wilbur Wright aeroplane".<ref>While this was possibly the first flight in Australia, the first flight in the Southern Hemisphere was probably made by Richard Pearse in New Zealand several years earlier, either in 1903 or 1904.</ref> Colin Defries was a trained pilot, having learnt to fly in Cannes, France. By modern standards his flight time was minimal, but in 1909 he had accumulated enough to become an instructor. On his first flight he took off, maintained straight and level flight, albeit briefly, and landed safely. His crash landing on his second flight, when he tried to retrieve his hat which was blown off, demonstrated what a momentary lack of attention could cause while flying a Wright Model A.

It is accepted by Australian historians<ref>The Powerhouse Museum is the major branch of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences in Sydney. [http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/blog/index.php/2009/12/first-powered-flight-in-australia-episode-4/ First Powered Flight in Australia- Episode 4 « Inside the collection – Powerhouse Museum]. Powerhousemuseum.com. Retrieved February 28, 2012.</ref> and the Aviation Historical Society of Australia that the definition of flight established by the Gorell Committee on behalf of the Aero Club of Great Britain dictates the acceptance of a flight or its rejection, giving Colin Defries credit as the first to make an aeroplane flight in Australia, and the Southern Hemisphere.

Additionally, aviation pioneer Richard Pearse is believed by many New Zealand historians to have undertaken his first flight as early as 1902, which would give him not only the Southern Hemisphere but the World record, although this is disputed.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/richard-pearse title=Richard Pearse accessdate=June 10, 2015 work=New Zealand History}}</ref>

In 1965, aviation journalist Stanley Brogden formed the view that the first powered flight in Australia took place at Bolivar in South Australia; the aircraft was a Bleriot monoplane with Fred Custance as the pilot. The flight took place on March 17, 1910. The next day when Houdini took to the air, the Herald newspaper reported Custances flight, stating it had lasted 5&nbsp;minutes 25&nbsp;seconds at a height of between 12 and 15&nbsp;feet.<ref name=smh/>

In 2010, Australia Post issued stamps commemorating Colin Defries, Houdini and John Robertson Duigan, crediting only Defries and Duigan with historical firsts.<ref>[http://auspost.com.au/about-us/harry-houdini-cant-escape-being-part-of-australias-history.html Australia Post – Harry Houdini cant escape being part of Australias history].

Australia Post did acknowledge the part Houdini played (Harry Houdini cant escape being part of Australias history) but did not attribute any record to him.

===After Australia===
After completing his Australia tour, Houdini put the Voisin into storage in England. He announced he would use it to fly from city to city during his next Music Hall tour, and even promised to leap from it handcuffed, but he never flew again.<ref>Silverman, pp. 137–154.</ref>

In the 1920s, Houdini turned his energies toward debunking parapsychology psychics and mediumship mediums, a pursuit that inspired and was followed by latter-day stage magicians.<ref name="Conjure">{{cite encyclopedia  first1=Ricky  last1=Jay  date=March 3, 2011  url=http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/14/117891/conjuring  title=Conjuring  encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica  accessdate=November 9, 2015}}</ref>

Houdinis training in magic allowed him to expose frauds who had successfully fooled many scientists and academics. He was a member of a Scientific American committee that offered a cash prize to any medium who could successfully demonstrate supernatural abilities. None was able to do so, and the prize was never collected. The first to be tested was medium George Valiantine of Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. As his fame as a "ghostbuster" grew, Houdini took to attending séances in disguise, accompanied by a reporter and police officer. Possibly the most famous medium whom he debunked was Mina Crandon, also known as "Margery".<ref>{{cite web  series=American Experience  title="Margery" the Medium Exposed  publisher=PBS  year=2011  accessdate=November 9, 2015  url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/houdini/sfeature/margery1.html}}</ref>

Joaquín Argamasilla known as the "Spaniard with X-ray Eyes" claimed to be able to Dermo-optical perception read handwriting or numbers on dice through closed metal boxes. In 1924, he was exposed by Houdini as a fraud.

Houdini chronicled his debunking exploits in his book, A Magician Among the Spirits, co-authored with C. M. Eddy, Jr., who was not credited. These activities cost Houdini the friendship of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Doyle, a firm believer in Spiritualism (religious movement) spiritualism during his later years, refused to believe any of Houdinis exposés. Doyle came to believe that Houdini was a powerful spiritualist medium, and had performed many of his stunts by means of paranormal abilities and was using these abilities to block those of other mediums that he was "debunking".<ref>see Conan Doyles The Edge of The Unknown, published in 1931.</ref> This disagreement led to the two men becoming public antagonists, and Sir Arthur came to view Houdini as a dangerous enemy.<ref name="secret"/>

Before Houdini died, he and his wife agreed that if Houdini found it possible to communicate after death, he would communicate the message "Rosabelle believe", a secret code which they agreed to use. Rosabelle was their favorite song. Bess held yearly Seances séances on Halloween for ten years after Houdinis death. She did claim to have contact through Arthur Ford (psychic) Arthur Ford in 1929 when Ford conveyed the secret code, but Bess later said the incident had been faked. The code seems to have been such that it could be broken by Ford or his associates using existing clues.<ref name="secret"/>    Evidence to this effect was discovered by Fords biographer after he died in 1971.<ref>{{cite book  first1=Allen  last1=Spragget  first2= William V.  last2=Rauscher  title=Arthur Ford: The Man Who Talked with the Dead  year=1974  publisher=New American Library  page=246}}</ref> In 1936, after a last unsuccessful séance on the roof of the Knickerbocker Hotel (Los Angeles) Knickerbocker Hotel, she put out the candle that she had kept burning beside a photograph of Houdini since his death. In 1943, Bess said that "ten years is long enough to wait for any man."

The tradition of holding a séance for Houdini continues, held by magicians throughout the world.

In 1926, Harry Houdini hired H. P. Lovecraft and his friend C. M. Eddy, Jr., to write an entire book about debunking religious miracles, which was to be called The Cancer of Superstition. Houdini had earlier asked Lovecraft to write an article about astrology, for which he paid $75. The article does not survive. Lovecrafts detailed synopsis for Cancer does survive, as do three chapters of the treatise written by Eddy.

==Appearance and voice recordings==
File:Jack Dempsey, Harry Houdini and Benny Leonard2.jpg thumb Heavyweight boxer Jack Dempsey mock-punching Houdini (held back by lightweight boxer Benny Leonard)Unlike the image of the classic magician, Houdini was short and stocky and typically appeared on stage in a long frock coat and tie. Most biographers give his height as {{nowrap 5&nbsp;ft 5 in}}, but descriptions vary. Houdini was also said to be slightly bow-legged, which aided in his ability to gain slack during his rope escapes. In the 1997 biography Houdini!!!: The Career of Ehrich Weiss, author Kenneth Silverman summarizes how reporters described Houdinis appearance during his early career:

{{quote They stressed his smallness—"somewhat undersized"—and angular, vivid features: "He is smooth-shaven with a keen, sharp-chinned, sharp-cheekboned face, bright blue eyes and thick, curly, black hair." Some sensed how much his complexly expressive smile was the outlet of his charismatic stage presence. It communicated to audiences at once warm amiability, pleasure in performing, and, more subtly, imperious self-assurance. Several reporters tried to capture the charming effect, describing him as "happy-looking", "pleasant-faced", "good natured at all times", "the young Hungarian magician with the pleasant smile and easy confidence".<ref>Silverman, p. 31.</ref>}}

Houdini made the only known recordings of his voice on Edison Phonograph cylinder wax cylinders on October 29, 1914, in Flatbush, New York. On them, Houdini practices several different introductory speeches for his famous Chinese Water Torture Cell Chinese water torture cell. He also invites his sister, Gladys, to recite a poem. Houdini then recites the same poem in German. The six wax cylinders were discovered in the collection of magician John Mulholland (magician) John Mulholland after his death in 1970. They are part of the David Copperfield (illusionist) David Copperfield collection.<ref name="Wild About Harry">{{cite web  url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/11/houdini-speaks-in-1970.html  title=Houdini speaks in 1970  accessdate=November 13, 2010}}</ref>

Harry Houdini died of peritonitis, secondary to a appendicitis ruptured appendix, at 1:26&nbsp;p.m. on October 31, 1926, in Room 401 at Detroits Grace Hospital, aged 52. In his final days, he optimistically held to a strong belief that he would recover, but his last words before dying were reportedly, "Im tired of fighting."<ref name="secret"/> Eyewitnesses to an incident at Houdinis dressing room in the Princess Theatre in Montreal gave rise to speculation that Houdinis death was caused by a McGill University student, Jocelyn Gordon Whitehead (b. 1895 – d. 1954), who delivered a surprise attack of multiple blows to Houdinis abdomen.<ref name=Snopes>{{cite web  last=Mikkelson  first=Barbara and David P.  date=September 2, 2014  title=Punched Out  url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/freakish/houdini.asp  publisher=Snopes.com}}</ref>

The eyewitnesses, students named Jacques Price and Sam Smilovitz (sometimes called Jack Price and Sam Smiley), proffered accounts of the incident that generally corroborated one another. Price describes Whitehead asking Houdini "if he believed in the miracles of the Bible" and "whether it was true that punches in the stomach did not hurt him". He then delivered "some very hammer-like blows below the belt". Houdini was reclining on a couch at the time, having broken his ankle while performing several days earlier. Price states that Houdini winced at each blow and stopped Whitehead suddenly in the midst of a punch, gesturing that he had enough, and adding that he had no opportunity to prepare himself against the blows, as he did not expect Whitehead to strike him so suddenly and forcefully. Had his ankle not been broken, he would have risen from the couch into a better position to brace himself.<ref name=Snopes/><ref>{{cite book  title=Edge of the Unknown  last=Conan Doyle  first=Arthur  url=https://www.amazon.com/Edge-Sir-Arthur-Conan-Doyle/dp/B00AZSCMA8/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1447096312&sr=1-1&keywords=edge+of+the+unknown&pebp=1447096314933&perid=0P11K5GHK33608SN7VBH#reader_B00AZSCMA8  year=1930  isbn=978-1409235149  subscription=yes}}</ref>

Throughout the evening, Houdini performed in great pain. He was unable to sleep and remained in constant pain for the next two days, but did not seek medical help. When he finally saw a doctor, he was found to have a fever of {{convert 102 °F °C abbr=on}} and acute appendicitis, and was advised to have immediate surgery. He ignored the advice and decided to go on with the show.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite book  title=The Man Who Killed Houdini  first=Don  last=Bell  publisher=Véhicule Press  date=September 28, 2005  isbn=978-1550651874}}</ref><ref name=Benoit>{{cite book  last=Benoit  first=Tod  title=Where Are They Buried?

Despite the diagnosis, Houdini took the stage. He was reported to have passed out during the show, but was revived and continued. Afterwards, he was hospitalized at Detroits Sinai-Grace Hospital#History Grace Hospital.<ref name=Snopes/>

It is not entirely clear what relationship the encounter in the dressing room had on Houdinis eventual death, as the relationship between blunt trauma and appendicitis is uncertain.<ref name=Snopes/> One theory suggests that Houdini was unaware that he was suffering from appendicitis, which would have been clearer to him had he not received blows to the abdomen.<ref name=Snopes/>

After taking statements from Price and Smilovitz, Houdinis insurance company concluded that the death was due to the dressing-room incident and paid double indemnity (insurance) double indemnity.<ref name="autogenerated3" />

==Houdini grave site==
Houdinis funeral was held on November 4, 1926, in New York City, with more than 2,000 mourners in attendance.<ref>{{cite news  last=Goldenberg  first=Suzanne  url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/24/usa.suzannegoldenberg1  title=Final Escape for the Master of Illusion?

A statuary bust was added to the exedra in 1927, a rarity, because graven images are forbidden in Jewish cemeteries. In 1975, the bust was destroyed by vandals. Temporary busts were placed at the grave until 2011 when a group who came to be called The Houdini Commandos from the Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania placed a permanent bust with the permission of Houdinis family and of the cemetery.<ref name="Houdini Returns">{{cite news  url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/houdini-returns-of-course/  title=Houdini Returns  accessdate=October 24, 2011   work=The New York Times  first=David W.  last=Dunlap  date=October 24, 2011}}</ref> The Society of American Magicians took responsibility for the upkeep of the site, as Houdini had willed a large sum of money to the organization he had grown from one club to 5,000-6,000 dues-paying membership worldwide. The payment of upkeep was abandoned by the societys dean George Schindler, who said "Houdini paid for perpetual care, but theres nobody at the cemetery to provide it", adding that the operator of the cemetery, David Jacobson, "sends us a bill for upkeep every year but we never pay it because he never provides any care." Members of the Society tidy the grave themselves.<ref name="Houdinis Final Trick">{{cite news  url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/houdinis-final-trick-a-tidy-grave/  title=Houdinis Final Trick, a Tidy Grave  accessdate=October 31, 2008   work=The New York Times  first=Corey  last=Kilgannon  date=October 31, 2008}}</ref>

Machpelah Cemetery operator Jacobson said, they "never paid the cemetery for any restoration of the Houdini family plot in my tenure since 1988", claiming that the money came from the cemeterys dwindling funds.

He is not only a magical icon; his gravesite bears the seal of The Society of American Magicians. That seal is our brand and we should be proud to protect it. This gravesite is clearly our responsibility and Im proud to report that the National Council unanimously voted to maintain Houdinis final resting place."<ref name="Abracadabra: Houdinis grave to get a facelift">{{cite web  url=http://www.qchron.com/editions/central/abracadabra-houdini-s-grave-to-get-a-facelift/article_8c97412d-b791-5add-b1a2-89caaad00dde.html  title=Houdinis grave to get a facelift  accessdate=October 9, 2014  work=Queens Chronicle  first=Christopher  last=Barca  date=October 9, 2014}}</ref>

The Houdini Gravesite Restoration Committee under the Chairmanship of National President David Bowers, is working closely with National President Kenrick "Ice" McDonald to see this project to completion. Bowers said it is a foregone conclusion that the Society will approve the funding request, because  "Houdini is responsible for the Society of American Magicians being what it is today. We owe a debt of gratitude to him." Like Bowers, McDonald said the motivation behind the repairs is to properly honor the grave of the "Babe Ruth of magicians". "This is hallowed ground," he said. "When you ask people about magicians, the first thing they say is Harry Houdini." While the actual plot will remain under the control of Machpelah Cemetery management, the Society of American Magicians, with the help of the Houdini Museum in Pennsylvania, will be in charge of the restoration.<ref name="Houdinis gravesite to get a magic fix in Queens">{{cite web  url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/houdini-queens-grave-site-magic-fix-article-1.1989172  title=Houdinis gravesite to get a magic fix in Queens  accessdate=October 27, 2014   work=Daily News (New York) New York Daily News  first=Eli  last=Rosenberg  date=October 27, 2014}}</ref>

Magicians Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brookz have been caring for the escape artists Queens grave over the years.  "This is a monument where people go and visit on a daily basis," said Dietrich who is spearheading restoration efforts. "The nearly 80-year-old popular plot at the Machpelah Cemetery has fallen into disrepair over the years."  "The Houdini Museum has teamed with The Society of American Magicians, one of the oldest fraternal magic organizations in the world, to give the beloved site a facelift."  The organization has a specific Houdini gravesite committee made up of nine members headed up by President elect David Bowers who brought this project to the Societys attention. Kenrick "Ice" McDonald, the current president of the Society of American Magicians said "You have to know the history. Houdini served as President from 1917 until his death in 1926. Houdinis burial site needs an infusion of cash to restore it to its former glory." Magician Dietrich said the repairs could cost "tens of thousands of dollars", after consulting with glass experts and grave artisans. "Its a wonderful project, but its taken a lifetime to get people interested," she said. "Its long overdue, and its great that its happening." Houdini was a living superhero," Dietrich said. "He wasnt just a magician and escape artist, he was a great humanitarian." To this day, the Society holds a broken wand ceremony at the grave every November.

Houdinis widow, Bess Houdini Bess, died of a heart attack on February 11, 1943, aged 67, in Needles, California while on a train en route from Los Angeles to New York City. She had expressed a wish to be buried next to her husband, but instead was interred 35&nbsp;miles due north at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Westchester County, New York, as her Catholic family refused to allow her to be buried in a Jewish cemetery.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://houdini.net/besshoudinideath.php  title=Bess Houdini dies in 1943  publisher=Houdini.net  accessdate=April 1, 2011}}</ref>

===Proposed exhumation===
On March 22, 2007, Houdinis grand-nephew (the grandson of his brother Theo), George Hardeen, announced that the courts would be asked to allow exhumation of Houdinis body, to investigate the possibility of Houdini being murdered by spiritualists, as suggested in the biography The Secret Life of Houdini.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/grandnephew-seeks-to-set-record-straight-about-houdini-s-death-1.660397  title=Grandnephew seeks to set record straight about Houdinis death  work=CBC News  accessdate=March 23, 2007  date=March 23, 2007}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Houdinis brother, Theodore Hardeen, who returned to performing after Houdinis death, inherited his brothers effects and props. Houdinis will stipulated that all the effects should be "burned and destroyed" upon Hardeens death. Hardeen sold much of the collection to magician and Houdini enthusiast Sidney Hollis Radner during the 1940s, including the water torture cell.<ref>{{cite news  title=In Sadness, Prime Houdini Artifact Collector Puts Items on Auction Block  quote=... Mr. Radner, aka Rendar the Magician, owns one of the worlds biggest and most valuable collections of Harry Houdini artifacts, including the Chinese Water Torture Cell, one of Houdinis signature props from 1912 until his death in 1926. Most of the items were given to Mr. Radner in the 1940s by Houdinis brother, Theodore Hardeen. Hardeen considered Radner, then a student at Yale with a reputation for jumping from diving boards in handcuffs, as his protégé. Until early this year, the collection was on display at the Outagamie Museum in Appleton, Wisconsin, where Houdinis father was the town rabbi in the 1870s. But after a rancorous falling out between Mr. Radner and museum officials, the 1,000-piece collection was packed-up and shipped here, where it will be auctioned on Saturday in the windowless back room at the Liberace Museum and on eBay.  work=The New York Times  date=October 29, 2004}}</ref> Radner allowed choice pieces of the collection to be displayed at The Houdini Magical Hall of Fame in Niagara Falls, Ontario. In 1995, a fire destroyed the museum. The water torture cells metal frame remained, and it was restored by illusion builder John Gaughan.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2007/02/mystery-of-two-torture-cells.html  title=The Mystery of the Two Torture Cells  accessdate=May 14, 2007  work=Wild About Harry}}</ref> Many of the props contained in the museum such as the mirror handcuffs, Houdinis original packing crate, a milk can, and a straitjacket, survived the fire and were auctioned in 1999 and 2008.

Radner loaned the bulk of his collection for archiving to the History Museum at the Castle Outagamie Museum in Appleton, Wisconsin but reclaimed it in 2003 and auctioned it in Las Vegas, on October 30, 2004.<ref name="houdini">{{cite web  url=http://www.houdini.com/houdiniauction.htm  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515020225/http://www.houdini.com/houdiniauction.htm  dead-url=yes  archive-date=May 15, 2006  title=Houdini&#039;s Magic Shop &#124; Easy Tricks &#124; Illusions &#124; Gags &#124; Novelties  publisher=houdini.com  accessdate=January 27, 2014}}</ref>

In 1934, the bulk of Houdinis collection of American and British theatrical material, along with a significant portion of his business and personal papers, and some of his collections of other magicians were sold to pay off estate debts to theatre magnate Messmore Kendall.

It is not open to the public, but tours are available by invitation to magicians, scholars, researchers, journalists and serious collectors.

In a posthumous ceremony on October 31, 1975, Houdini was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7001 Hollywood Blvd.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.walkoffame.com/harry-houdini  title=Harry Houdini  work=walkoffame.com  accessdate=May 13, 2015  publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce  quote=Address: 7001 Hollywood Blvd. Ceremony: October 31, 1975.}}</ref>

The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania, bills itself as "the only building in the world entirely dedicated to Houdini". It is open to the public year-round by reservation.

== In popular culture ==
* Houdini appeared as himself in Weird Tales magazine in three ghostwritten fictionalizations of sensational events from his career (issues of March, April, and May-June-July 1924). The third story, "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs," was written by horror writer H. P. Lovecraft based on Houdinis notes. The Houdini-Lovecraft collaboration was envisioned to continue, but the magazine ceased publication for financial reasons. When it resumed later in 1924, Houdini no longer figured in its plans.<ref>"The Magicians Ghostwriters" in The Things Incredible!
