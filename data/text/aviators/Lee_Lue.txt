==Biography==
Lee Lue was born in 1935 to Chong Ger Lee and his wife Pa Vang in the village of Phou Pheng in Xiangkhoang Province, Laos. In 1953, Lee Lues family moved to Xieng Khouang city after the Vietnamese invaded Laos. After the war ended in 1955, Lee Lue married Jou and two years later their first child, a son named Ze, was born. Lee Lue studied in Xieng Khouang city and later enrolled in teacher training school. In 1959, he took a position as an elementary school teacher in Lat Houng. He was among a handful of Hmong teachers in the entire country.  As the Secret War was escalating in 1967, Touby Lyfoung and General Vang Pao requested volunteers for flight training in T-28s. The training took place in Thailand. With six months of flight training, Lee Lue and another volunteer, Vang Toua, became the first two Hmong T-28 fighter pilots. Lee Lue successfully flew aerial support for ground troops and built a record number of sorties.

Away from the war, Lee Lue devoted his time to studying maps, and playing cards with his comrades. Prior to his death, Lee Lue had purchased his military uniform and was waiting to receive the rank of major. "He was excited about the promotion," said his wife Jou.  Hours before his death, the area of Muang Soui was under heavy enemy attack.  Gen. Vang Pao then telephoned Lee Lue, who was flying from Vientiane, to see if he carried any bombs with him as he was on his way to Long Cheng. Lee Lues North American T-28 Trojan T-28 was armed. Vang Pao needed Lee Lue to attack the Pathet Lao troops in Muang Soui as they were losing ground as well as troops. On that day, Lee Lues T-28 was hit and his plane was later found in debris. "His death is among a few soldiers I cried to," stated Vang Pao in 2006. According to Christopher Robbins book, The Ravens, respect for Lee Lue and his skills was shared by not just the Hmong but also seasoned American pilots.<ref>[http://www.learnabouthmong.org/presentation/hmonghistory_files/frame.htm#slide0007.htm HMONG HISTORICAL FIGURES PRESENTATION] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927095233/http://www.learnabouthmong.org/presentation/hmonghistory_files/frame.htm  date=2007-09-27 }}</ref>  Meanwhile, Vang Toua was lost among thick clouds and never seen again.
