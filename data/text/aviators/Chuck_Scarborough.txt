==Life and career==
A native of Pittsburgh and a graduate of the University of Southern Mississippi, Scarborough served in the United States Air Force
and currently has a commercial aviator pilot certificate. His career in television began in Mississippi as a reporter at WLOX-TV in Biloxi, Mississippi Biloxi and later WDAM-TV in Laurel, Mississippi Laurel, before moving to WAGA-TV in Atlanta.

Scarboroughs first major market anchoring job came in 1972, at WNAC-TV (defunct) WNAC-TV in Boston. He was originally hired as part of a two-man anchor team with respected New England journalist Lee Nelson, but was soon made the solo anchor of the stations news broadcasts. In addition to his anchor work, he was called on to host a weekly program called Mass Reaction, in which the public was invited to the studio to question news broadcasters and newsmakers.

In his final broadcast on WNAC-TV, Scarborough ended the newscast with a commentary in which he identified the issue of race as the most important challenge facing Boston. A scant few months later, Boston erupted into racial unrest as the result of a federal court order to end its policy of de facto racial segregation in the public schools. While WNAC had been the perennial trailer among Bostons three VHF television news broadcasts, with Scarborough as anchor the station managed to best its rivals in the 6pm newscast ratings.

Scarborough joined NBC News in March 1974 as sole anchor of WNBC-TVs then-new 5:00 PM newscast, NewsCenter 4 (later renamed News 4 New York).
Eventually, he became the stations lead anchor at 6pm and 11pm. In 2003, he became the unofficial "dean" of New York-area television news anchors when WABC-TV anchor Bill Beutel retired after 37 years. He surpassed Beutel as New Yorks most tenured English-language news anchor in 2011. Five years later, Scarborough succeeded Rafael Pineda (television journalist) Rafael Pineda of Spanish-language WXTV as the longest-serving anchor in New York television history. For much of his first 20 years with NBC, he occasionally appeared on the network as a correspondent and often anchored the networks prime-time news updates.

At WNBC, he has worked alongside Marv Albert, Len Berman, Jack Cafferty, Frank Field (meteorologist) Dr. Frank Field, John Hambrick, Pat Harper, Pia Lindstrom, Sue Simmons, Michele Marsh (reporter) Michele Marsh, Al Roker, and Tom Snyder, among others.

Scarborough was the host of the Television syndication syndicated programs Images â€“ A Year in Review and Memories...Then and Now in the late 1980s-early 1990s, and also co-anchored the NBC network documentary series Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow with Maria Shriver and Mary Alice Williams.

The 11:00 pm broadcast on July 14, 2017, marked Scarboroughs last in that time slot after 42 years, as he cut back on his schedule to working only the 6pm. Taking his place at 11 will be Stefan Holt, the son of NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt.
