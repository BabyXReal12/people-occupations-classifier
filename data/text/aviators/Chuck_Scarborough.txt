==Life and career==
A native of Pittsburgh and a graduate of the University of Southern Mississippi, Scarborough served in the United States Air Force<ref>https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2011/september/pilot/pilots</ref> and currently has a commercial aviator pilot certificate. His career in television began in Mississippi as a reporter at WLOX-TV in Biloxi, Mississippi Biloxi and later WDAM-TV in Laurel, Mississippi Laurel, before moving to WAGA-TV in Atlanta.

Scarboroughs first major market anchoring job came in 1972, at WNAC-TV (defunct) WNAC-TV in Boston. He was originally hired as part of a two-man anchor team with respected New England journalist Lee Nelson, but was soon made the solo anchor of the stations news broadcasts. In addition to his anchor work, he was called on to host a weekly program called Mass Reaction, in which the public was invited to the studio to question news broadcasters and newsmakers.

In his final broadcast on WNAC-TV, Scarborough ended the newscast with a commentary in which he identified the issue of race as the most important challenge facing Boston. A scant few months later, Boston erupted into racial unrest as the result of a federal court order to end its policy of de facto racial segregation in the public schools. While WNAC had been the perennial trailer among Bostons three VHF television news broadcasts, with Scarborough as anchor the station managed to best its rivals in the 6pm newscast ratings.

Scarborough joined NBC News in March 1974 as sole anchor of WNBC-TVs then-new 5:00 PM newscast, NewsCenter 4 (later renamed News 4 New York).<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/74-OCR/1974-03-18-BC-0085.pdf "New anchor at WNBC-TV."
