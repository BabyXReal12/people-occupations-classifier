Please only add notable occupations, i.e. things for which he is famous--> He is the lead singer of the Heavy metal music heavy metal band Iron Maiden and is renowned for his wide-ranging operatic vocal style and energetic stage presence.

Born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, Dickinson began his career in music fronting small pub bands in the 1970s while attending school in Sheffield and university in London. In 1979, he joined the new wave of British heavy metal band Samson (band) Samson, with whom he gained some popularity under the stage name "Bruce Bruce" and performed on two studio records. He left Samson in 1981 to join Iron Maiden, replacing Paul DiAnno, and debuted on their 1982 album The Number of the Beast (album) The Number of the Beast. During his first tenure in the band, they issued a series of US and UK platinum and gold albums in the 1980s.

Dickinson quit Iron Maiden in 1993 (being replaced by Blaze Bayley) to pursue his solo career, which saw him experiment with a wide variety of heavy metal and rock styles. He rejoined the band in 1999, along with guitarist Adrian Smith, with whom he has released five subsequent studio albums. Since his return to Iron Maiden, he issued one further solo record in 2005, Tyranny of Souls. His younger cousin, Rob Dickinson, is the former lead singer of British alternative rock band Catherine Wheel (band) Catherine Wheel, while his son, Austin, fronted the metalcore band Rise to Remain.

Outside his career in music, Dickinson is well known for his wide variety of other pursuits. Most notably, he undertook a career as a commercial pilot for Astraeus Airlines, which led to a number of media-reported ventures such as captaining Iron Maidens converted charter aeroplane, Iron Maiden#Ed Force One Ed Force One, during their world tours. Following Astraeus closure, he created his own aircraft maintenance and pilot training company in 2012, Cardiff Aviation. Dickinson presented his own radio show on BBC Radio 6 Music from 2002–2010, and has also hosted television documentaries, authored novels and film scripts, created a successful beer with Robinsons Brewery and competed at fencing internationally.

==Early life==
Paul Bruce Dickinson was born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=198}} His mother, Sonia, worked part-time in a shoe shop, and his father, Bruce, was a mechanic in the army.{{Sfnm 1a1=Wall 1y=2004 1p=198 2a1=Shooman 2y=2007 2p=11}} Dickinsons birth hurried the young couple, then just teenagers, into marriage.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=198}} Initially, he was brought up by his grandparents; his grandfather was a coal-face worker at the local colliery and his grandmother was a housewife.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=198}} This is referred to in his song "Born In 58" from the album Tattooed Millionaire.{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=119}}

Dickinson started school at Manton Primary in Worksop while his parents moved away to Sheffield.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=198}} Soon afterwards, when he was six, he was also despatched to Sheffield,{{sfn Wall 2004 p=200}} where he attended a primary school in Manor, South Yorkshire Manor Top.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=201}} After six months, his parents decided to move him to a small private school called Sharrow Vale Junior.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=201}} Due to constant moving, Dickinson states that this period of his life taught him to be self-reliant as he was unable to make close friends.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=202}} Dickinson has a younger sister, professional showjumper :de:Helena Stormanns Helena Stormanns, who was born in 1963.{{Sfnm 1a1=Shooman 1y=2007 1p=12 2a1=DSouza 2y=2005}} He tried to isolate himself from her as much as he could when he was young, supposedly out of spite because she, unlike him, was a planned pregnancy and birth.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=203}}

Dickinsons first musical experience was dancing in his grandparents front room to Chubby Checkers "The Twist (song) The Twist", when he still lived with them in Worksop.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=199}} The first record Dickinson recalls owning was The Beatles single "She Loves You", which he managed to persuade his grandfather to buy him, which made him more interested in music.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=199}} He tried to play an acoustic guitar belonging to his father, but it blistered his fingers.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=201}}

By the time he moved to Sheffield, Dickinsons parents were earning a good living from buying property, refurbishing it and then selling it for a profit.{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=12}} As a result, much of Dickinsons childhood was spent living on a building site, until his parents bought a boarding house and a bankrupt garage where his father began selling second-hand cars.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=201}} The income from their business success gave them the opportunity to give Dickinson—then 13 years old—a boarding school education and they chose Oundle School Oundle, a public school (UK) public school in Northamptonshire.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=201}} Dickinson was not opposed to moving away from home because he had not built "any real attachment" to his parents, having been raised by his grandparents in Worksop until he was six.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=201}}

At Oundle, Dickinson was picked on and routinely bullied by the older boys of Sidney House, the boarding house that he belonged to,{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=13}} which he described as "like systematic torture" and meant that he became an outsider.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=203}} His interests at Oundle were often military; he co-founded the school wargames society with Mike Jordan, and he rose to a position of some power in the schools cadet force,{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=13}} with which he was allowed to handle live ammunition, which he used to create explosions as booby-traps.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=204}}

Oundle was where Dickinson became attracted to hard rock, after hearing Deep Purples "Child in Time" being played in another students room.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=204}} As a result, the first album he ever bought was Deep Purple in Rock Deep Purples In Rock, which created his interest in rock music.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=205}} After In Rock, he went on to buy Black Sabbaths Black Sabbath (album) debut, Jethro Tull (band) Jethro Tulls Aqualung (Jethro Tull album) Aqualung and Tarkus by Emerson, Lake & Palmer.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=205}} Every term, a band would play at the school, the first of these which Dickinson saw was called Wild Turkey, featuring former Jethro Tull bassist Glenn Cornick.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=205}} After that, he saw Van der Graaf Generator and Arthur Brown (musician) Arthur Brown.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=205}}

Dickinson initially wanted to play the drums,{{sfn Wall 2004 p=205}} later obtaining a pair of bongo drums from the music room for practice.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=206}} He remembers playing "Let It Be (song) Let It Be" with his friend Mike Jordan, during which Dickinson discovered his singing voice while encouraging Jordan to sing the high-notes.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=206}} Shortly afterwards Dickinson was expelled from Oundle for participating in a prank in which he urinated in the headmasters dinner.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=206}}

Returning home to Sheffield in 1976, Dickinson enrolled at King Edward VII School, Sheffield King Edward VII School, at which he joined his first band.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=207}} He had overheard two other pupils talking about their band and that they needed a singer and so volunteered immediately.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=207}} They rehearsed in the garage of the drummers father, and the band were impressed by Dickinsons singing, encouraging him to buy his first microphone.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=207}} Their first gig took place at the Broadfield Tavern in Sheffield.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=207}} Originally called "Paradox", the band changed their name on Dickinsons suggestion to "Styx", unaware of the Styx (band) American act with the same name.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=208}} They made local newspaper headlines when a steel worker was awoken by their performance and tried to smash the bands drum kit.{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=17}} Soon afterwards the band split up.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=208}}

==University==
After leaving school with GCE Advanced Level A-levels in English, History and Economics, Dickinson confessed, "I didnt really know what I wanted to do."{{sfn Wall 2004 p=208}} The first thing he did was join the Territorial Army (United Kingdom) Territorial Army for six months.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=208}} Although he enjoyed his time in the TA, Dickinson realised that it was not a career choice, and so he applied for a place to read history at Queen Mary University of London Queen Mary College, London.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=208}} His parents wanted him in the army, but he told them that he wanted to get a degree first, which acted as his "cover story", and immediately began playing in bands.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=208}}

At university, Dickinson got involved in the Entertainments Committee: "one day youd be a roadie for The Jam, the next youd be putting up the Stonehenge backdrop for Hawkwind or whatever."{{sfn Wall 2004 p=209}} In 1977, Dickinson met Paul "Noddy" White, a multi-instrumentalist who owned a PA and other equipment, with whom Dickinson, along with drummer Steve Jones, would form a band together called Speed.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=209}} According to Dickinson, the band was called Speed because of the way in which they played, rather than a reference to drug-taking. {{sfn Wall 2004 p=209}} In Speed, Dickinson began writing his own material after White taught him how to play three chords on the guitar.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=209}}

Although Speed would play several gigs at the Green Man pub in Plumstead, the band did not last long, but it encouraged Dickinson to continue to work towards being a musician.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=209}} Dickinson spotted an advertisement in Melody Maker with the caption "Singer wanted for recording project" and replied immediately.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=209}} He recorded a demo tape and sent it with a note which read: "By the way, if you think the singings crap, theres some John Cleese stuff recorded on the other side you might find amusing."{{sfn Wall 2004 p=209}} They liked what they heard and invited Dickinson down to the studio to make "Dracula", the first song he would ever record, with a band called "Shots",{{sfn Wall 2004 p=209}} formed by two brothers, Phil and Doug Siviter.{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=21}} The song would later appear on the second disc of The Best of Bruce Dickinson compilation.  The brothers were impressed with Dickinsons vocal abilities and asked him to join their group.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=210}}

Dickinson played pubs with Shots on a regular basis to small audiences.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=210}} One particular night, Dickinson suddenly stopped in the middle of a song and started interviewing a man in the audience, heckling for not paying enough attention.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=210}} He got such a good response he started doing it every night until it became a regular routine used to catch the audiences attention. Dickinson states that this experience taught him how to be a frontman.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=210}}

The next step in Dickinsons career was taken in a pub called the Prince of Wales in Gravesend, Kent, where Shots were playing regularly, when Thunderstick Barry Graham ("Thunderstick") and Paul Samson paid a visit.{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=33}} Impressed with his stage-act, they talked with Dickinson afterwards and invited him to be their new singer.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=211}} Dickinson agreed to join their band, Samson (band) Samson, but only once hed finished taking his History finals two weeks later.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=211}} Until that point, he had been neglecting his University education.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=211}} As a result, the University had tried to kick him out for failing his Second Year exams and not paying his accommodation fees, but was saved because of his role as Entertainments Officer.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=211}} After writing 6 months worth of essays in the space of two weeks and some last minute cramming for his exams, Dickinson achieved a British undergraduate degree classification#Lower second-class honours 2:2.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=211}}

On 19 July 2011, Dickinson was presented with an honorary Doctor of Music music doctorate from his alma mater, in honour of his contribution to the music industry.{{sfnm 1a1=Dome 1y=2011 2a1=Queen Mary University of London 2y=2011}}

After meeting Paul Samson and Barry Purkis at the Prince of Wales, and while still undertaking his final university exams, Dickinson joined Samson onstage at Bishops Stortford to perform one of their songs, "Rock Me Baby", cementing his role as their new lead vocalist.{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=35}}

The band had already released their debut album, Survivors (Samson album) Survivors, in 1979 on an independent music independent label, two months before Dickinson joined.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=211}} Immediately following the completion of his University work, he met up with the band at Greenwichs Wood Wharf studios to learn the Survivors album.{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=36}} Although the tracks did not suit his vocal style,{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=40}} the band soon wrote the majority of the following Head On (Samson album) Head On album in their earliest rehearsal sessions,{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=38}} some of which were immediately incorporated into their live set.{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=40}}

It was during these early rehearsals that the nickname "Bruce Bruce" came about, derived from Monty Pythons "Bruces sketch".{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=38}} The name became very tiresome as the bands management continually wrote dud cheques, made payable to "Bruce Bruce", as a joke.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=213}} Dickinson later commented that he did not like it but considered it "a sort of stage name" and accepted it.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=213}}

Dickinson was dismayed to learn that not all rock performers were "great artists"; he felt that some, such as Samson, were only interested in women, drugs and alcohol, which he was unable to relate to.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=212}} Although he had smoked joint (cannabis) joints before,{{sfn Wall 2004 p=212}} Dickinson discovered that it was impossible to communicate with other band members if he was sober, deciding that it was "the price that had to be paid".{{sfn Wall 2004 p=213}}

While fronting the band, Dickinson also came across Iron Maiden for the first time, who were supporting Samson at the Music Machine in 1980.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=214}} As Dickinson recalls; "I was watching them, and they were good, really fucking good, and at that moment, I remember thinking, I wanna fucking sing for that band. In fact, Im going to sing for that band! I know Im going to sing for that band! ... I just thought, This is really me. Not Samson."{{sfn Wall 2004 p=214}}

Dickinson remained in the band for another year, recording two studio albums with them—Head On and Shock Tactics.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=213}} However, Samson soon ran into difficulties with their record label, Gem, who went out of business and failed to finance their European tour in support of Iron Maiden.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=216}} The band were turned over to RCA, which began neglecting the group, and so they promptly fired their management team and the resulting injunction meant that their equipment was reclaimed and they could not be paid for their concert performances.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=216}} The bands last gig was at Reading and Leeds Festivals Reading Festival, after which Dickinson was approached by Iron Maidens manager, Rod Smallwood, who asked him to audition to be their new lead vocalist.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=217}}

===Beginnings and success: 1981–1985===

Dickinson went to audition for Iron Maiden at a rehearsal room in Hackney in September 1981 and immediately discovered that this was a much more professional operation than he was used to with Samson.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=218}} In the practice rooms, the band played through "Prowler", "Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song) Sanctuary", "Running Free" and "Remember Tomorrow", before asking Dickinson to sing the same songs again in a recording studio, and he was immediately inducted into the group.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=218}}

Iron Maiden had a strict and organised routine that suited the bands writing style, which Dickinson described as a "time table".{{sfn Book of Hours 1996}} After a few gigs, they began writing new material for their third album, The Number of the Beast (album) The Number of the Beast, released in 1982. In the wake of Samsons contractual problems, Dickinson could not legally be credited on any of the records songs,{{sfn Wall 2004 p=224}} having to make, what he called, a "moral contribution", later revealing that he had contributed limited creative input to "The Prisoner", "Children of the Damned" and "Run to the Hills".{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=82}} The album was a major success, topping the UK charts,{{sfn Official Charts Company}} and earning platinum status in the UK and the US.{{Sfnm 1a1=BPI 2a1=RIAA}} Following the release, the band embarked on a The Beast on the Road supporting tour around the globe.

On the following albums, 1983s Piece of Mind and 1984s Powerslave, Steve Harris (musician) Steve Harriss song-writing monopoly was pushed aside in favour of other members ideas, with Dickinson contributing to a number of tracks, including the singles "Flight of Icarus" and "2 Minutes to Midnight".{{sfn Prato}} Throughout the World Slavery Tour, as part of the new theatrical elements incorporated into the bands stage-show, Dickinson wore a feathered mask during "Powerslave".{{sfn EMI 2008}} This was the bands longest tour to date, during which Dickinson considered going home mid-tour, due to the high number of shows.{{sfn Stenning 2006}} Iron Maidens management were continually adding dates, until Dickinson demanded that they stop or he would leave the group.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=255}}

===Growing tensions and departure: 1986–1993===
After a six-month break, which Dickinson mostly spent practising fencing,{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=100}} Iron Maiden began writing their next album, Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album) Somewhere in Time. Dickinson was disappointed with the effort as he felt that the band needed a more dramatic stylistic departure from past records to remain relevant, despite its introduction of synthesizer synthesised bass and guitars.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=260}} He has no writing credits on the release, as his material, based on his own suggestion that the album should be more acoustic-focused, was rejected by the rest of the band.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=260}} Steve Harris, on the other hand, stated that his material was rejected because it was not good enough, and that Dickinson "was probably more burnt out than anyone at the end of the last tour".{{sfn Wall 2004 p=261}}

After a Somewhere on Tour subsequent tour, Iron Maiden started working on their next studio effort, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which featured more progressive rock elements than the bands previous records.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=264}} Although it became their second release to top the UK charts,{{sfn Official Charts Company}} it was also Dickinsons first album with the band that did not achieve platinum status in the US.{{sfn RIAA}} Unlike Somewhere in Time, Dickinson was much more enthusiastic about this album due to its concept and has several song-writing credits.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=265}} After Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour the following tour in 1988, the band decided to take a year off.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=273}}

If youre like, Wow, this is really fucking cool tonight, man, theyre all gonna sit there going, What a wanker. Hes leaving. How can it be cool?

During the next albums writing stage, Adrian Smith left Iron Maiden, and was replaced by Janick Gers. Iron Maidens eighth studio release, 1990s No Prayer for the Dying, had a raw sound that, according to AllMusic, did not "hold up well" compared to past efforts,{{sfn Prato(3)}} as it was recorded in a barn which Steve Harris owned, with Rolling Stones Mobile Studio a mobile studio owned by the Rolling Stones.{{sfn Berelian 2000}} The record featured Dickinsons "Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter", originally composed for A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child a film soundtrack, which despite receiving a Golden Raspberry Award for Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song worst original song 10th Golden Raspberry Awards in 1989, became the bands first and only single to top the UK Singles Chart.{{sfn Official Charts Company}} By 1992, Harris had converted his barn into a proper studio, and the new album, Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album) Fear of the Dark, was recorded there,{{sfn Wall 2004 p=289}} resulting in a better overall sound than No Prayer for the Dying,{{sfn Prato(4)}} although Dickinson still claims it had limitations due to its size.{{sfn Berelian 2000}}

After the Fear of the Dark Tour, Dickinson decided to leave Iron Maiden to concentrate on his solo career.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=293}} At that point the band had already booked Real Live Tour a following tour in 1993, which Dickinson did not enjoy. Throughout the tour, Dickinson drew a lot of criticism from his bandmates, with Steve Harris in particular saying, "I really wanted to kill him."{{sfn Wall 2004 p=296}} According to Harris, Dickinson would only perform when the press was there,{{sfn Wall 2004 p=297}}  whereas at other concerts he would only mumble his way through songs.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=296}} Dickinson has since denied the accusations that he was deliberately under-performing, arguing that it was impossible to give a decent performance some nights because of the atmosphere.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=297}} His last performance with the band was filmed by the BBC at Pinewood Studios and released as a live video, entitled Raising Hell (video) Raising Hell.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=298}}

===Return: 1999–present===

Along with Adrian Smith, Dickinson rejoined Iron Maiden in 1999 with Janick Gers remaining in the band, after he was approached by manager Rod Smallwood.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=328}} Smallwood also spoke to Steve Harris about Dickinsons return, who initially had reservations about the prospect, but soon came round to the idea, deliberating that they knew of his abilities and that it was a case of "better the devil you know".{{sfn Wall 2004 p=328}} Harris and Dickinson agreed to meet at Smallwoods home in Brighton in January 1999 for the first conversation they would have with each other since 1993.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=329}} Although both men were nervous about the encounter, upon seeing each other the tension immediately dissipated and both agreed that Dickinson should return to the group.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=329}}

After embarking on The Ed Hunter Tour a small tour, the band set about recording Brave New World (Iron Maiden album) Brave New World, their first studio album with Dickinson since 1992. Dickinson insisted that they find a replacement for the now retired Martin Birch, the bands regular producer, and record in a different studio than the one in which they made No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark, to which Harris agreed.{{sfn Wall 1999}} The album was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris with producer Kevin Shirley,{{sfn Wall 2004 p=342}} after which Iron Maiden undertook a Brave New World Tour supporting tour culminating with a performance at the Rock in Rio festival before a crowd of 250,000.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=349}}

In 2003 they recorded and released Dance of Death (album) Dance of Death at Londons Sarm West Studios SARM Studios with Kevin Shirley, now the bands new regular producer.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=368}} After two further stints on the road (Dance of Death World Tour and Eddie Rips Up the World Tour) Iron Maiden returned to SARM in 2006 to record their next studio album, A Matter of Life and Death (album) A Matter of Life and Death,{{sfn Lane 2006}} and embarked on A Matter of Life and Death Tour a supporting tour. In 2008 and 2009, the band set out on the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour,{{sfn Bezer 2008}} which has since been described as "groundbreaking"{{sfn Bezer 2011}} for its use of Ed Force One, the bands customised Boeing 757, flown by Dickinson himself,{{sfn Bezer 2008}} and led to the documentary film Iron Maiden: Flight 666, which had a limited cinema release in April 2009.{{sfn Michaels 2009}} Iron Maiden held The Final Frontier World Tour another world tour in 2010 and 2011 in support of The Final Frontier,{{sfn Bezer 2010}} their first album recorded at Compass Point Studios, Nassau, Bahamas Nassau, Bahamas since 1986s Somewhere in Time,{{sfn Lawson 2010}} and which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in 28 countries.{{sfn Coleman 2011}}

In September 2014, Iron Maiden began recording their sixteenth studio album, The Book of Souls, at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris.{{sfn Ferguson 2015}} The release features two songs written solely by Dickinson for the first time since Powerslave, "If Eternity Should Fail" and "Empire of the Clouds",{{sfn Childers 2015}} the former originally penned for a possible solo record.{{sfn Lombardelli 2015}} "Empire of the Clouds" is notable for being the bands longest ever song, at over 18 minutes in length,{{sfn Grow 2015}} and features Dickinson on piano for the first time, which is how the song was written.{{sfn Lombardelli 2015}} The band The Book of Souls World Tour toured the album in 2016, during which Dickinson once again piloted the bands private plane, Ed Force One (now a Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet).{{sfn Lach 2015}}

In Eddie Rips Up the World Tour 2005, Iron Maiden co-headlined the US festival tour, Ozzfest, with Black Sabbath. Lead singer Ozzy Osbournes wife, Sharon Osbourne Sharon, encouraged family friends and members of other bands to sabotage Iron Maidens last performance at Hyundai Pavilion in San Bernardino, California, on 20 August,{{Sfnm 1a1=Sullivan 1y=2005 2a1=Blabbermouth.net 2y=2005b}} in an attack which Rod Smallwood criticised as "vile, dangerous, criminal and cowardly", as well as disrespectful to fans who had paid to see the band perform "a full unhindered performance".{{sfn KNAC 2005}} Osbourne ordered interference with the bands PA, delayed the entrance of Eddie (mascot) Eddie, the bands mascot,{{sfn Sullivan 2005}} and encouraged members of the Osbourne camp to throw eggs, lighters and bottle tops from the front of the audience.{{sfn Wilde 2008}} According to Dickinson, the attack was in response to his "disparaging remarks about Reality television reality-TV shows that she took personally",{{sfn Wilde 2008}} although The Guardian reported that he slated the Osbournes reality series and accused Ozzy Osbourne of using a teleprompter.{{sfn Sullivan 2005}} Dickinson has since denied making comments against Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath,{{sfn Dome 2006}} but admitted that he criticised Ozzfest throughout the tour, attacking their "corporate" seating layout and saying, "Most of the bands are there because they paid to be there."{{sfn Blabbermouth.net 2006c}}

Following the concert at San Bernardino, Osbourne released a further statement which accused Dickinson of making several anti-American comments,{{sfn Blabbermouth.net 2005a}} of which Classic Rock stated that "nobody can present any cast-iron evidence".{{sfn Classic Rock 2005}} In addition, Osbourne claimed that the flag-waving during "The Trooper" was disrespectful to American troops,{{sfn Blabbermouth.net 2005a}} at the time fighting alongside the British in Iraq War Iraq, even though Dickinson had always held a Union Flag during the song, being based on the Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War.{{sfn Classic Rock 2005}} It was also reported that Steve Harris had spoken to Ozzy Osbourne in San Bernardino, apologising for Dickinsons comments,{{Sfnm 1a1=Classic Rock 1y=2005 2a1=Blabbermouth.net 2y=2005a}} which Harris denies, stating that his words had been "twisted".{{sfn Dome 2006}}

==Solo career==
In early 1989, Zomba Label Group Zomba asked Dickinson to produce a track for the movie A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child,{{sfn Nightmare on Elm Street Films}} providing a budget, a studio, and a producer, Chris Tsangarides. Dickinson took up the opportunity and called an old friend of his, former Gillan (band) Gillan guitarist, Janick Gers, and, shortly after meeting up, they had "Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter" ready for the studio,{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=116}} then recorded with the assistance of bassist Andy Carr, and drummer Fabio del Rio.{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=117}} "I wrote it in about three minutes", states Dickinson, "I dont know where the title Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter came from, but it just popped into my head. I thought, Bloody hell, straight out of AC/DC! And I thought, Nightmare on Elm Street. Yeah, thatll do.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=281}} Impressed with the results, Zomba asked Dickinson if he was willing to record a whole album as well.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=281}} With the same line-up and producer, Dickinsons solo debut, Tattooed Millionaire, was written and recorded within two weeks, and released in May 1990,{{sfn Wall 2004 p=281}} followed by a supporting tour.{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=122}}

Later that year, Dickinson participated on a re-recording of Deep Purples "Smoke on the Water", as part of the humanitarian effort Rock Aid Armenia.{{sfn ProgArchives.com}} Backed by the band Skin (UK band) Skin, he produced a cover version of Alice Coopers "Elected (song) Elected", along with Rowan Atkinson (in character as Mr. Bean#Mr. Bean Mr. Bean), which was used in 1992 for Comic Relief,{{sfn Discogs}} and five years later, on Bean (film)#Soundtrack Bean Soundtrack.{{sfn AllMusic}}

For his second solo effort, Dickinson received the collaboration of American producer, Keith Olsen, and, while working on the record in LA, decided to leave Iron Maiden.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=293}} Unhappy with the direction he was taking with Olsen, Dickinson began working with Tribe of Gypsies guitarist Roy Z and started the album again from scratch.{{sfn Book of Hours 1996}} Balls to Picasso was recorded with Tribe of Gypsies as the backing band,{{sfn Book of Hours 1996}} and was released in 1994.

After the Balls to Picasso supporting tour finished, he started working on a new studio record, Skunkworks (album) Skunkworks. Dickinson decided that Skunkworks would be the title of the band as well, but the record company refused to release the album without his name on the cover.{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=155}} Dickinson hired producer Jack Endino, most noted for producing the first Nirvana (band) Nirvana album. The "Skunkworks" entity ceased to be when the tour ended. "I was devastated by the Skunkworks thing", stated Dickinson, "Skunkworks was a record which I tore myself apart to make and nobody seemed to give a shit."{{sfn Book of Hours 1998}}

After a short period of inactivity, Dickinson once again teamed up with Roy Z and Tribe of Gypsies to record his next album, Accident of Birth; "It was actually Roy that dragged me back into some assemblance, because he called up and he said, Listen, Ive got some stuff and its like a metal record. And I wasnt thrilled, I wasnt really sure that I had anything to offer&nbsp;... Then he played me some backing-tracks hed done for what was to become Accident of Birth down the phone and I thought There is something there."{{sfn Book of Hours 1998}} Former Iron Maiden guitarist, Adrian Smith, was asked to guest on the record, but remained as a full-time member of Dickinsons solo outfit.{{sfn Stagno 2006d}} The album marked a return to heavy metal for Dickinson, with Sputnikmusic remarking, "The albums heavy feel is very satisfying, and definitely fills that void left by Maiden during the 90s."{{sfn Stagno 2006d}} The follow-up, The Chemical Wedding (Bruce Dickinson album) The Chemical Wedding, was a semi-concept album on alchemy, which drew inspiration from William Blakes writings; with some songs, such as "Book of Thel", having The Book of Thel the same title as some of his poems, and the cover artwork featuring The Ghost of a Flea one of his paintings.{{sfn Book of Hours 1998}} The record was even more successful than its predecessor, with Sputnikmusic commenting, "Bruce had shattered all expectations to create an album that might even be better than the previous one."{{sfn Stagno 2006e}} During The Chemical Weddings supporting tour, the live album, Scream for Me Brazil was recorded in São Paulo, after which Dickinson and Smith returned to Iron Maiden in February 1999.

In 2000, Dickinson performed vocals on the song, "Into the Black Hole", for Ayreons Universal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator.{{sfn Aardschok 2000}} Later that year, he collaborated with Judas Priests front-man, Rob Halford, recording, "The One You Love to Hate", for Halford (band) Halfords debut, Resurrection (Halford album) Resurrection.{{sfn Adams 2000}} A compilation, entitled The Best of Bruce Dickinson, was released in late 2001, including two new songs and a bonus disc of rarities.{{sfn dmme.net 2001}} His latest solo album, Tyranny of Souls was released in May 2005. This time the song-writing was all split between Roy Z and Dickinson and many songs were composed by Z sending recordings of riffs to Dickinson while he was on tour with Iron Maiden.{{sfn Book of Hours 2005}} On 21 June 2005, Dickinsons complete solo discography was re-released, featuring bonus discs with rare and remastered tracks. That same year, Dickinson contributed to the song, "Beast in the Light", from Tribuzys album, Execution (album) Execution, and their Execution – Live Reunion subsequent live album.{{sfn AllMovie}} A three-DVD box set, entitled Anthology (Bruce Dickinson video) Anthology, was released on 19 June 2006, containing concerts and promo videos from throughout his solo career, as well as an old Samson (band) Samson video, entitled "Biceps of Steel".{{sfn Blabbermouth.net 2006b}}

In December 2017, Dickinson said that he has tentative plans for his next solo album to be "a whole concept album", with the title being If Eternity Should Fail, the same song name from Iron Maidens album The Book of Souls, in which he confirmed that it was originally penned as a solo track, "So if I did do another solo album, which I think I will, I might just stick to my original plan and have that as the title track. I mean, I did write it — it was the first track that I wrote for it. So, yeah, Id probably still include that song. But it would be… the feel would be slightly different — not very much, though — from the Maiden version."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-singer-bruce-dickinsons-next-solo-album-will-probably-include-reworked-version-of-if-eternity-should-fail/ title=IRON MAIDEN Singer BRUCE DICKINSONs Next Solo Album Will Probably Include Reworked Version Of If Eternity Should Fail publisher=Blabbermouth.net accessdate=8 December 2017}}</ref>

===Writing===
{{Quote box width=30em align=right quote="I always fancied the idea of writing a book, and I was bored on the road, so I sat down and started at page one! I had an idea for this character called Lord Iffy Boatrace, whos an upper class chinless wonder. I wrote it the same way I write a song. Write the first note, and dont know what the second ones going to be. About halfway through you suddenly realise what it is youre writing about." source=Dickinson on writing his first novel.{{sfn Hotten 1990}}}}

During a 1986–1987 Somewhere on Tour Iron Maiden tour, and in the wake of a divorce, Dickinson started writing his first book.{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=102}} Inspired by the novels of Tom Sharpe, in addition to Biggles and Penthouse (magazine) Penthouse, he created The Adventures of Lord Iffy Boatrace,{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=104}} which Kerrang! describes as "a satirical swipe at fetishism among the upper classes",{{sfn Hotten 1990}} and whose title character is a "semi-Transvestism transvestite" British land owner.{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=104}}

Following its completion, Dickinson approached Sidgwick & Jackson, who, according to Dickinson, agreed to publish the book before reading it based on Iron Maidens album sales alone.{{sfn Hotten 1990}} Released in 1990 <small>({{ISBN 0-283-06043-3}})</small>, the novel sold more than 40,000 copies almost immediately.{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=105}} Due to the high demand, Sidgwick & Jackson asked Dickinson to produce a sequel,{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=105}} which became 1992s The Missionary Position <small>({{ISBN 0-283-06092-1}})</small>, a satire of televangelism.{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=105}} No further additions to the series have been published, although Dickinson did write the first 60 pages to a prequel, set during "Lord Iffys schooldays", which he "just thought was rubbish and ripped it all up. I didnt think it was funny."{{sfn Shooman 2007 p=125}}

Dickinson has turned his hand to scriptwriting, co-authoring Chemical Wedding (film) Chemical Wedding with director Julian Doyle (filmmaker) Julian Doyle. The film, in which Dickinson played a few small cameo roles and composed the soundtrack, was released in 2008 and starred Simon Callow.{{sfn Tookey 2008}}

On 15 October 2015, HarperCollins and Dey Street announced that they would publish Dickinsons memoirs.{{sfn Hendicott 2015}} What Does This Button Do?{{sfn Dickinson 2017}} was released on 19 October 2017.{{sfn Munro 2017}}

===Beer===
In 2013, Iron Maiden collaborated with Robinsons Brewery in Stockport, England to create Trooper, a 4.8% cask/4.7% bottled ale{{sfn Boshoff 2013}} whose recipe Dickinson formulated with head brewer Martyn Weeks.{{sfn Bell 2014}} As of May 2014, the beer has sold 2.5&nbsp;million pints in 40 countries, making it Robinsons most successful export.{{sfn Bell 2014}}

Following Troopers success, Dickinson, a fan of traditional English cask beer,{{sfn Boshoff 2013}} stated that he intends to develop more beers in the future, although new products will be "under the umbrella of Trooper and not Iron Maiden [as] Trooper has taken on a life of its own. People drink it because they like the beer, not because they are Maiden fans."{{sfn Bravewords 2014}} Additional beers have included Trooper Red N Black Porter (5.8 per cent ABV), Trooper Hallowed (6.0 per cent ABV), and a limited edition "666" (at 6.66 per cent ABV).

==Singing style and stage performance==
Although Dickinson never received formal training, he still possesses a wide vocal range which was trademarked by his quasi-operatic tenor.{{sfn Petridis 2015}} Along with Ronnie James Dio and Rob Halford, Dickinson is one of the pioneers of the operatic vocal style later to be adopted by power metal vocalists and regularly appears near the top in lists of the greatest rock vocalists/front-men of all time.{{Sfnm 1a1=Roadrunner Records 1y=2011 2a1=Hit Parader 2y=2010 3a1=Blabbermouth.net 3y=2009 4a1=Graham 4y=2009}} Dickinson says that his style was influenced primarily by Arthur Brown (musician) Arthur Brown, Peter Hammill (Van der Graaf Generator), Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull (band) Jethro Tull) and Ian Gillan (Deep Purple).{{sfn dmme.net 2001}}

Dickinsons singing varied notably in the 1990s in the recording of albums such as No Prayer for the Dying, Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album) Fear of the Dark and his first solo work Tattooed Millionaire, making use of a much more raspy and unpolished sound,{{sfn Stagno 2006c}} befitting their stripped down style.{{sfn Wall 2004 p=283}} Since returning to Iron Maiden in 1999, his singing style has returned to much like it was in the 1980s,{{sfn Stagno 2006a}} though his voice has lowered with age.{{sfn Stagno 2006b}} According to a report published in the Daily Mirror, Dickinson has an estimated vocal range of 4.25 octaves.{{sfn Beech Scott 2014}} His voice led to the nickname "The Air Raid Siren", which Billboard (magazine) Billboard states is "due to the ferocious power of his singing",{{sfn Wall 1985}} although Dickinson claims it actually originated from a fan complaint.{{sfn Eagle Vision 2001}}

In addition to his vocal ability, Dickinson is known for his energetic stage performances, which he delivers consistently despite his age.{{Sfnm 1a1=Labrador 1y=2013 2a1=Ramirez 2y=2013}} He considers including the audience "the essence of the Maiden experience" and that his role is to "shrink the venue ... to turn that football stadium into the worlds smallest club".{{sfn Sexton 2008}} To achieve this, Dickinson insists on gaining eye contact with audience members{{sfn Beaumont 2014}} and urges them to join in with the phrase "scream for me" (followed by the concerts location).{{Sfnm 1a1=Cashmere 1y=2008 2a1=Thomson 2y=2008}} He is critical of performers who do not connect with their fans, particularly those who "[hide] behind the amps" and use an autocue, remarking that "people pay good money and [they] cant even remember the sodding words".{{sfn Beaumont 2014}}
