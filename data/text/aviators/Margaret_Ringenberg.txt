==Books==
Tom Brokaw devoted a chapter to Margaret Ringenberg in his book The Greatest Generation.<ref name="APObituary" /> During an interview with Brokaw she said, “I started out flying because I wanted to be a stewardess—you call them flight attendants nowadays—and I thought ‘what if the pilot gets sick or needs help? I don’t know the first thing about airplanes’ and that’s where I found my challenge. I never intended to solo or be a pilot. I found it was wonderful.” Following her death, Brokaw said, in a telephone interview "Margaret was one of my favorites".<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.journalgazette.net/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID%3D%2F20080729%2FLOCAL%2F807290306  title=Archived copy  accessdate=2005-11-25  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522122351/http://www.journalgazette.net/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080729%2FLOCAL%2F807290306  archivedate=2011-05-22  df= }}</ref>
