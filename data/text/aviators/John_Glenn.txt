Colonel (United States) Colonel John Herschel Glenn Jr. (July 18, 1921 – December 8, 2016) was a United States Marine Corps Aviation United States Marine Corps aviator, engineer, astronaut, and United States Senate United States Senator from Ohio. In 1962, he became the first American to orbit the Earth, circling it three times.

Before joining NASA, Glenn was a distinguished fighter pilot in World War II, Operation Beleaguer China and Korean War Korea. He shot down three MiG-15 aircraft, and was awarded six Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Distinguished Flying Crosses and eighteen Air Medals. In 1957, he made the first supersonic transcontinental flight across the United States. His on-board camera took the first continuous, panoramic photograph of the United States.

He was one of the Mercury Seven, military test pilots selected in 1959 by NASA as the United States first astronauts. On February 20, 1962, Glenn flew the Mercury-Atlas 6 Friendship 7 mission, becoming the first American to orbit the Earth, and the fifth person and third American in space. He received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1962 and the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978, was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1990, and was the last surviving member of the Mercury Seven.

Glenn resigned from NASA in January 1964. He planned to run for a List of United States Senators from Ohio U.S. Senate seat from Ohio, but an injury in February 1964 forced his withdrawal. He retired from the United States Marine Corps Marine Corps the following year. He lost a close Primary elections in the United States primary election in 1970. A member of the Democratic Party (United States) Democratic Party, Glenn first United States Senate election in Ohio, 1974 won election to the Senate in 1974 and served for 24 years until January 1999. In 1998, while still a sitting Senator, Glenn became the oldest person to fly in space as a crew member of the Space Shuttle Discovery Discovery space shuttle and the only person to fly in both the Mercury and Space Shuttle programs. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012.

==Early life and education==
John Herschel Glenn Jr. was born on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, the son of John Herschel Glenn Sr., who worked for a plumbing firm, and Clara Teresa {{nee Sproat}}, a teacher.
His parents had married shortly before his father, a member of the American Expeditionary Force, left for the Western Front (World War I) Western Front during World War I. The family moved to New Concord, Ohio, soon after his birth, and his father started his own business, the Glenn Plumbing Company.{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=43–46}}{{sfn Kupperberg 2003 pp=15, 35}} He took his first flight in an airplane with his father when he was eight years old. He became fascinated by flight, and built model airplanes from balsa wood kits.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=13–16}} Along with his adopted sister Jean,{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=43–46}} he attended New Concord Elementary School.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=25}} He washed cars and sold rhubarb to earn money to buy a bicycle, after which he took a job delivering The Columbus Dispatch newspaper.{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=46–47}} He was a member of the Boy Rangers of America Ohio Rangers, an organization similar to the Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America) Cub Scouts.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=24–29}} His boyhood home in New Concord has been Building restoration restored as a historic house museum and education center.
Glenn attended John Glenn High School (New Concord, Ohio) New Concord High School, where he played on the Varsity team varsity American football football team as a Center (gridiron football) center and linebacker. He also made the varsity basketball and tennis teams, and was involved with Hi-Y, a junior branch of the YMCA.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=47}} After graduating in 1939, Glenn entered Muskingum College, where he studied engineering,
and Annie majored in music, with minors in secretarial studies and physical education, as she was on the Swimming (sport) swimming and volleyball teams.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=58–59}} Glenn was a member of the Stag Club fraternity there,
and played on the football team.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=58–59}} He earned a private pilot license under the Civilian Pilot Training Program in 1941,{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=60}} gaining credit in his physics course,
since the course included aerodynamics, combustion and heat transfer.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=60}} He did not complete his senior year in residence or take a proficiency exam, both required by the school for its Bachelor of Science degree. Muskingum awarded his degree in 1962, after Glenns Mercury Atlas 6 Mercury space flight.
==Military career==
===World War II===
When the Attack on Pearl Harbor Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, Glenn quit college to voluntarily enlist in the United States Army Air Corps U.S. Army Air Corps.
Never called to duty, he enlisted as a U.S. Navy Aviation Cadet Training Program (USN) aviation cadet in March 1942. Glenn attended the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa Iowa City for pre-flight training and continued at Naval Air Station Olathe in Kansas for primary training, where he made his first solo flight in a military aircraft. During advanced training at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas, he accepted an offer to transfer to the U.S. Marine Corps.
Having completed his flight training in March 1943, Glenn was commissioned as a second lieutenant. After advanced training at Camp Kearny, California, he was assigned to Marine Squadron VMJ-353, which flew R4D transport planes from there.{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=51–55}} Also at Camp Kearny there was a Fighter aircraft fighter squadron, VMO-155, which flew the Grumman F4F Wildcat. Glenn approached the squadrons commander, Major J. P. Haines, who suggested that he could put in for a transfer. This was approved, and Glenn was posted to VMO-155 on July 2, 1943. Two days later, the squadron moved to Marine Corps Air Station El Centro in California.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=93-96}} The Wildcat was obsolete by this time, and VMO-155 re-equipped with the Vought F4U Corsair F4U Corsair in September 1943.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=103–107}} He was promoted to First lieutenant#U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force first lieutenant in October 1943, and shipped out to Hawaii in January 1944.{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=51–55}} It was intended that VMO-155 would move to the Marshall Islands but this was delayed, and on February 21 it moved to Midway Atoll and became part of the garrison. This had been the site of the Battle of Midway in 1942, but was a backwater by this time.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=111–117}} VMO-155 moved to the Marshall Islands in June 1944, and flew 57 combat missions in the area.{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=51–55}}{{sfn Carpenter et al. 2010 p=31}} He received two Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Distinguished Flying Crosses and ten Air Medals.
Glenn returned to the United States at the end of his one-year tour of duty in February 1945, and was assigned to Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina and then to Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. He was promoted to Captain (United States O-3) captain in July 1945, shortly before the end of the Pacific War war in the Pacific, but was uncertain of securing a regular commission in the Marine Corps. He was ordered back to Cherry Point, where he joined VMF-913, another Corsair squadron, and learned that he had qualified for a regular commission.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=135–141}}{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=51–55}} In March 1946, he was assigned to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in southern California. He volunteered for service with the Operation Beleaguer occupation in North China, believing that it would be a short tour. He joined VMF-218 (another Corsair squadron), which was based at Beijing Nanyuan Airport Nanyuan Field near Beijing, in December 1946,{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=147}} and flew patrol missions until VMF-218 was transferred to Guam in March 1947. He returned home in December 1948.
{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=51–55}}

Glenn was re-posted to NAS Corpus Christi, first as a student at the Naval School of All-Weather Flight, and then as a flight instructor.{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=51–55}} In July 1951, he was sent to the Amphibious Warfare School at Marine Corps Base Quantico in northern Virginia for a six-month course.{{sfn Tilton 2000 p=34}} He then joined the staff of the Commandant, Marine Corps Schools. Given only four hours of flying time per month, he maintained his proficiency (and flight pay) by flying on weekends.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=166}} He was promoted to Major (United States) major in July 1952.{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=51–55}} Glenn received the World War II Victory Medal (United States) World War II Victory Medal, American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with one service star star), Navy Occupation Service Medal (with Asia clasp), and the China Service Medal for his efforts.
===Korean War===

The names of his wife and children are also written on the aircraft.
Glenn took a short period of leave during which he moved his family back to New Concord, and after two and a half months of jet training at Cherry Point, Glenn was ordered to South Korea in October 1952, late in the Korean War. {{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=167–169}} Before he set out for Korea in February 1953, he applied for an inter-service exchange position with the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to fly the North American F-86 Sabre F-86 Sabre jet fighter-interceptor. In preparation, he arranged with Colonel Leon W. Gray to check out the F-86 at Otis Air Force Base in Massachusetts.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=186–187}} Pending this exchange assignment, Glenn reported to Pohang Airport K-3, an airbase in South Korea, on February 3, 1953, and was assigned to VMF-311, one of two Marine fighter squadrons there, as its operations officer.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=171}} VMF-311, equipped with the F9F Panther jet fighter-bomber, was assigned a variety of missions. Glenn flew his first, a reconnaissance flight, on February 26.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=175}} He flew 63 combat missions in Korea with VMF-311,{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=186}} and was nicknamed "Magnet Ass" because of his ability to attract enemy flak (an occupational hazard of low-level close air support missions);{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=180}} twice, he returned to base with over 250 holes in his plane.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=180}}{{sfn Mersky 1983 p=183}} He flew for a time with Marine reservist Ted Williams (a future Baseball Hall of Fame Hall of Fame baseball player with the Boston Red Sox) as his wingman,{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=180–184}} and also flew with future major general Ralph H. Spanjer.
In June 1953, Glenns USAF exchange position came through and he reported for duty with the USAFs 25th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, and flew 27 combat missions in the F-86, a much faster aircraft than the F9F Panther, patrolling MiG Alley.
Combat with a MiG-15, which was faster and better armed still,{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=187}} was regarded as the apogee for a fighter pilot. On the USAF buses that took the pilots out to the airfields before dawn, pilots who had been shot at by a MiG could sit while those who had not had to stand.{{sfn Wolfe 1979 pp=41–42}} Glenn later wrote, "Since the days of the Lafayette Escadrille during World War I, pilots have viewed air-to-air combat as the ultimate test not only of their machines but of their own personal determination and flying skills. I was no exception."{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=185}} He hoped to become the second Marine jet flying ace after John F. Bolt. When Glenn complained about there not being any MiGs to shoot at, his USAF squadron mates painted "MiG Mad Marine" on his aircraft.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=189}} He shot down his first MiG in a dogfight on July 12, 1953, downed a second one on July 19, and a third on July 22 during an aerial engagement in which four Sabres shot down three MiGs. These were the final air victories of the war, which ended with an armistice five days later.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=192–196}} For his service in Korea, Glenn received two more Distinguished Flying Crosses and eight more Air Medals.
{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=55–56}} Glenn also received the Korean Service Medal (with two campaign stars), United Nations Korea Medal, Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal, National Defense Service Medal (with one star), and the Korean War Service Medal.
===Test pilot===
File:John Glenn on Jet (cropped).jpg thumb left upright alt=Photo of John Glenn leaning out of a cockpit looking into the distance John Glenn sitting in the cockpit of a jet aircraft at the U.S. Navy Test Station at Patuxent River, Maryland, 1954.
With combat experience as a fighter pilot, Glenn applied for training as a flight test test pilot while he was still in Korea. He reported to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River in Maryland in January 1954, and graduated in July.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=204–206}}
At Patuxent River he was tutored in physics and math by the future Medal of Honor recipient, James Stockdale.
Glenns first flight test assignment, testing the North American FJ-2/-3 Fury FJ-3 Fury, nearly killed him when its cockpit depressurized and its oxygen system failed.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=208–210}} He also tested the armament of aircraft such as the Vought F7U Cutlass and Vought F-8 Crusader F8U Crusader.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=212–220}} From November 1956 to April 1959, he was assigned to the Fighter Design Branch of the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C., and attended the University of Maryland, College Park University of Maryland.
On July 16, 1957, he made the first supersonic transcontinental flight.
At that time, the transcontinental speed record, held by an Air Force Republic F-84 Thunderjet, was 3 hours 45 minutes and Glenn calculated that an F8U Crusader could do it faster. Since its {{convert 586 mph adj=on}} air speed was faster than that of a .45 caliber ammunition .45 caliber bullet, Glenn called his project Project Bullet.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=220–221}} He flew an F8U Crusader {{convert 2445 mi}} from Los Alamitos Army Airfield Los Alamitos, California to Floyd Bennett Field in New York City in under {{frac 3 1 2}} hours. The actual time was 3 hours, 23 minutes and 8.3 seconds,
averaging supersonic speed despite three Aerial refueling in-flight refuelings when speeds dropped below {{convert 300 mph}}. His on-board camera took the first continuous, transcontinental Panoramic photography panoramic photograph of the United States.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=222–227}}
He received his fifth Distinguished Flying Cross for this mission,{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=228}} and he was promoted to lieutenant colonel (United States) lieutenant colonel on April 1, 1959.{{sfn Burgess 2015 p=68}} His cross-country flight made him a minor celebrity. A profile piece appeared in The New York Times and he appeared on the television show Name That Tune.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=222–227}} He now had nearly 9,000 hours of flying time, including about 3,000 hours in jets.

==NASA career==
{{Main Project Mercury}}

===Selection===
{{Main Mercury Seven}}
File:GPN-2000-001027.jpg thumb upright alt=Glenn in a silver spacesuit, with his helmet on and clear visor down Glenn in his Navy Mark IV Mercury spacesuit
On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite. This shattered American confidence in its technological superiority, creating a wave of anxiety known as the Sputnik crisis. Among his responses, President of the United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched the Space Race. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was established on October 1, 1958, as a civilian agency to develop space technology. One of its first initiatives was publicly announced on December 17, 1958. This was Project Mercury,{{sfn Burgess 2011 pp=25–29}} which aimed to launch a man into Earth orbit, return him safely to the Earth, and evaluate his capabilities in space.{{sfn Swenson Grimwood Alexander 1966 p=134}}

While Glenn was on duty at Patuxent and in Washington, he read everything he could find about space. His office was asked to send a test pilot to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to make runs on a spaceflight simulator, as part of research by the newly formed NASA into re-entry vehicle shapes. The pilot would also be sent to the Naval Air Warfare Center Warminster Naval Air Development Center in Johnsville, Pennsylvania, and would be subjected to high G-forces in a centrifuge for comparison with data collected in the simulator. His request for the position was granted, and he spent several days at Langley and a week in Johnsville for the testing.
NASA asked military-service members to participate in planning the mockup of a spacecraft. Since he had participated in the research at Langley and Johnsville, he was sent to the McDonnell plant in St. Louis as a service adviser to NASAs spacecraft mockup board.
NASA received permission from Eisenhower to recruit its first astronauts from the ranks of military test pilots. The service records of 508 graduates of test pilot schools were obtained from the United States Department of Defense. From these, 110 were found that matched the minimum standards:{{sfn Atkinson Shafritz 1985 pp=36–39}} the candidates had to be younger than 40, possess a bachelors degree or equivalent and to be {{convert 5 ft 11 in}} or less. Only the height requirement was strictly enforced, owing to the size of the Project Mercury spacecraft.{{sfn Burgess 2011 p=35}} This was fortunate for Glenn, who barely met the requirements, as he was near the age cutoff and lacked a science-based degree.
The 110 were then split into three groups, with the most promising in the first group.{{sfn Burgess 2011 p=38}} The first group of 35, which included Alan Shepard, assembled at the Pentagon on February 2, 1959. The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, and the USAF officers were addressed by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General (United States) General Thomas D. White. Both pledged their support to the Space Program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They conceded that it would be a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance.{{sfn Burgess 2011 pp=46–51}}{{sfn Atkinson Shafritz 1985 pp=40–42}}

File:Mercury Seven astronauts with aircraft.jpg thumb left The Mercury Seven astronauts posing with a USAF F-106. alt=The astronauts pose in alphabetical order in front of a delta-winged white jet aircraft. They are holding their flight helmets under their arms. The three Navy aviators wear orange flight suits; the Air Force and Marine ones wear green. 
The briefing process was repeated with a second group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six were found to be over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six.{{sfn Atkinson Shafritz 1985 p=42}} Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute Lovelace Clinic and the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory.{{sfn Atkinson Shafritz 1985 pp=43–47}} Only one candidate, Jim Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error;{{sfn Burgess 2011 pp=234–237}} thirteen others were recommended with reservations. The director of the NASA Space Task Group, Robert R. Gilruth, found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.{{sfn Burgess 2011 pp=234–237}}

After testing, the astronaut candidates had to wait 10 to 12 days for the results. Glenn had returned to his position at the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics when he received a call from the associate director of Project Mercury, Charles Donlan, offering him a position.
The identities of the seven were announced at a press conference at Cutts–Madison House Dolley Madison House in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959:{{sfn Burgess 2011 pp=274–275}} Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton.{{sfn Atkinson Shafritz 1985 pp=42–47}} Glenn, wrote Tom Wolfe, "came out of it as tops among seven very fair-haired boys. He had the hottest record as a pilot, he was the most quotable, the most photogenic, and the lone Marine."{{sfn Wolfe 1979 p=121}} The magnitude of the challenge ahead of them was made clear a few weeks later, on the night of May 18, 1959, when the seven astronauts gathered at Cape Canaveral to watch their first rocket launch, of an SM-65D Atlas, which was similar to the one that was to carry them into orbit. A few minutes after liftoff, it spectacularly exploded, lighting up the night sky. The astronauts were stunned. Shepard turned to Glenn and said: "Well, Im glad they got that out of the way."{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=274–275}}

Glenn remained an officer in the Marine Corps after his selection,{{sfn Tilton 2000 p=43}} but was assigned to the NASA Space Task Group at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.
The task force moved to Houston, Texas, in 1962, and became part of the NASA Johnson Space Center Manned Spacecraft Center.
A portion of the astronauts training was in space science, but it had a practical aspect, which included scuba diving and work in simulators.
Astronauts secured an additional role in the spaceflight program: to provide pilot input in design. The astronauts divided the various tasks between them. Glenns specialization was cockpit layout design and control functioning for the Mercury and early Apollo programs.
He pressed the other astronauts to set a moral example, living up to the squeaky-clean image of them that had been portrayed by Life (magazine) Life magazine, a position that was not popular with the other astronauts.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=292–295}}

====Friendship 7 flight====
{{Main Mercury-Atlas 6}}
File:Friendship 7 (big).jpg thumb right Glenn entering his spacecraft, Friendship 7, prior to the launch of Mercury-Atlas 6 on February 20, 1962.
Glenn was a backup pilot for Shepard and Grissom on the first two manned Project Mercury flights, Mercury-Redstone 3 and Mercury-Redstone 4 sub-orbital missions.
Glenn was selected for Mercury-Atlas 6, NASAs first manned orbital flight, with Carpenter as his backup. Putting a man in orbit would achieve one of Project Mercurys most important goals.{{sfn Swenson Grimwood Alexander 1966 p=407}} Shepard and Grissom had named their spacecraft Freedom 7 and Liberty Bell 7. The numeral 7 had originally been the production number of Shepards spacecraft, but had come to represent the Mercury 7. Glenn named his spacecraft, number 13, Friendship 7, and had the name hand-painted on the side like the one on his F-86 had been.{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=76–79}} Glenn and Carpenter completed their training for the mission in January 1962, but postponement of the launch allowed them to continue rehearsing. Glenn spent 25 hours and 25 minutes in the spacecraft performing hanger and altitude tests, and 59 hours and 45 minutes in the simulator. He flew 70 simulated missions and reacted to 189 simulated system failures.{{sfn Swenson Grimwood Alexander 1966 p=418}}

After a long series of delays,{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=80–86}} Friendship 7 lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on February 20, 1962. There were eleven delays during the countdown due to equipment malfunctions and improvements and the weather. During Glenns first orbit, a failure of the automatic-control system was detected. This forced Glenn to operate in manual mode for the second and third orbits, and for re-entry. Later in the flight, telemetry indicated that the ablative heat shield heat shield had loosened. If this reading were accurate, Glenn and his spacecraft would burn up on re-entry. After a lengthy discussion on how to deal with this problem, ground controllers decided that leaving the retrorocket pack in place might help keep the loose heat shield in place. They relayed these instructions to Glenn, but did not tell him that the heat shield was possibly loose; although confused at this order, he complied. Leaving the retrorocket pack on made large chunks of flaming debris fly past the window of his capsule during re-entry, which Glenn thought might have been the heat shield. He told an interviewer, "Fortunately it was the rocket pack—or I wouldnt be answering these questions."
After the flight, it was determined that the heat shield was not loose, but rather that the sensor was faulty.

{{efn The spacecraft landed {{convert 41 mi}} west and {{convert 19 mi}} north of the target landing site. Friendship 7 was recovered by the {{USS Noa DD-841 6}}, which had the spacecraft on the deck 21 minutes after landing; Glenn was in the capsule during the recovery operation.
}} He carried a note on the flight which read, "I am a stranger. I come in peace. Take me to your leader and there will be a massive reward for you in eternity" in several languages, in case he landed near southern Pacific Ocean islands.
The original procedure called for Glenn to exit through the top hatch, but he was uncomfortably warm and decided that egress through the side hatch would be faster.
During the flight, he endured 7.8 Gs of acceleration and traveled {{convert 75679 mi}}
<!-- statute miles-->
at about {{convert 17500 mph}}.
The flight took Glenn to a maximum altitude (apogee) of about {{convert 162 mi}} and a minimum altitude of {{convert 100 mi}} (perigee).
The flight made Glenn the first American to orbit the Earth,
the third American in space, and the fifth human in space.
{{efn Perth, Western Australia, became known worldwide as the "City of Light"
when residents turned on their house, car and streetlights as Glenn passed overhead.
The city repeated the act when Glenn rode the Space Shuttle in 1998.
}} The mission, which Glenn called "best day of his life", renewed U.S. confidence.
His flight occurred while the U.S. and the Soviet Union were embroiled in the Cold War and competing in the Space Race.
As the first American in orbit Glenn became a national hero, met President John F. Kennedy, and received a ticker-tape parade in New York reminiscent of those honoring Charles Lindbergh and other dignitaries.
He became "so valuable to the nation as an iconic figure", according to NASA administrator Charles Bolden, that Kennedy would not "risk putting him back in space again."
Glenns fame and political potential were noted by the Kennedys, and he became a friend of the Kennedy family. On February 23, 1962, President Kennedy gave him the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for his Friendship 7 flight.
Upon receiving the award, Glenn said, "I would like to consider I was a figurehead for this whole big, tremendous effort, and I am very proud of the medal I have on my lapel."
Glenn also received his sixth Distinguished Flying Cross for his efforts.
He was among the first group of astronauts to be awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor. The award was presented to him by President Jimmy Carter in 1978. After his 1962 spaceflight, NASA proposed giving Glenn the Medal of Honor, but Glenn did not think that would be appropriate. His military and space awards were stolen from his home in 1978, and remarked that he would keep this medal in a safe.
In June 1963, the Soviet Union launched a female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova into orbit. In response, NASA contemplated recruiting women to the astronaut corps, but Glenn gave a speech before the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology House Space Committee detailing his opposition to sending women into space, in which he said: {{quote I think this gets back to the way our social order is organized, really. It is just a fact. The men go off and fight the wars and fly the airplanes and come back and help design and build and test them. The fact that women are not in this field is a fact of our social order.
}}

NASA had no official policy prohibiting women, but the requirement that astronauts had to be military test pilots effectively excluded them.{{sfn Atkinson Shafritz 1985 p=96}} NASA dropped this requirement in 1965,{{sfn Atkinson Shafritz 1985 pp=77–81}} but did not select any women as astronauts until 1978, when six women were selected, although none as pilots.{{sfn Atkinson Shafritz 1985 pp=133–134}} After Tereshkova, no women of any nationality would fly in space again until August 1982, when the Soviet Union launched pilot-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya.
During the late 1970s, Glenn reportedly supported Space Shuttle Mission Specialist Judith Resnik in her career.{{sfn Kevles 2003 p=98}}

Kennedy suggested to Glenn and his wife in December 1962 that he run for the United States Senate U.S. Senate for List of United States Senators from Ohio Ohio in 1964, challenging aging incumbent Stephen M. Young (1889–1984) in the Democratic primary election. Since it seemed unlikely that he would be selected for Project Apollo missions,
he resigned from NASA on January 16, 1964, and announced his Democratic Party (United States) Democratic Party candidacy for the U.S. Senate from his home state of Ohio the following day.
Glenn was still a Marine, and had plenty of unused leave time. He elected to use it while he waited for his retirement papers to go through.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=303}}

While attempting to fix a mirror in a hotel room, he was hospitalized for a concussion sustained in a fall against a bathtub in late February;
an inner-ear injury from the accident left him unable to campaign.
He withdrew from the race on March 30.
Both his wife and Scott Carpenter campaigned on his behalf during February and March, but doctors gave Glenn a recovery time of one year. Glenn did not want to win solely due to his astronaut fame, so he dropped out of the race on March 30.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=305}}

Glenn was still on leave from the Marine Corps, and he withdrew his papers to retire so he could keep a salary and health benefits.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=306}} Glenn was in consideration to be promoted to full colonel, but he reiterated to the Marine Corps his intention to retire so that another Marine could receive the promotion. President Johnson later decided to promote Glenn to full colonel status, without taking someone elses spot. He retired as a Colonel (United States) colonel on January 1, 1965. He was approached by RC Cola to join their public relations department, but Glenn declined it since he wanted to be involved with a business and not just the face of it. The company revised their offer, and offered Glenn a vice president of corporate development position, as well as a spot on the board of directors.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=310–311}} The company later expanded Glenns role, promoting him to president of Royal Crown International.

In 1970, Young did not seek reelection and the seat was open. Businessman Howard Metzenbaum, Youngs former campaign manager, was backed by the Ohio Democratic party and major labor unions, which provided him a significant funding advantage over Glenn. Glenns camp convinced him to be thrifty during the primary so he could save money for the general election. By the end of the primary campaign, Metzenbaum was outspending Glenn 4:1.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=324}} Glenn was defeated in the Democratic primary by Metzenbaum (who received 51 percent of the vote to Glenns 49 percent). Some prominent Democrats said Glenn was a "hapless political rube",
and one newspaper called him "the ultimate square".
Metzenbaum later lost the general election to Robert Taft Jr.
Glenn continued to remain active in the political scene following his defeat. John J. Gilligan, the Ohio Governor at the time, appointed Glenn to be the chairman of the Citizens Task Force on Environmental Protection in 1970. The task force was created to survey environmental problems in the state and released a report in 1971 detailing the issues. The meetings and the final report of the task force were major contributors to the formation of Ohios Environmental Protection Agency.

In 1974, Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox was fired by President Nixon. The United States Attorney General Attorney General, Elliot Richardson, resigned in protest of the firing during the Saturday Night Massacre. Ohio Senator William Saxbe, elected in 1968, was appointed Attorney General, which freed up an Ohioan seat. In the wake of the new vacancy, Ohios governor John J. Gilligan John Gilligan needed to appoint a new senator. Metzenbaum and Glenn both vied for the position. Gilligan was planning on a presidential or vice-presidential run in the near future, and offered Glenn the Lieutenant Governor of Ohio lieutenant governor position, with the thought Glenn would ascend to governor when Gilligan was elected to a higher position. Glenn declined, denouncing their attempts as "bossism" and "blackmail".
Metzenbaums campaign agreed to back Gilligan in his governor re-election campaign, and Metzenbaum was subsequently appointed to the vacated seat in January.
Glenn challenged Metzenbaum again in the primary for the Ohio Senate seat.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=328}}

Glenns campaign changed their strategy since the 1970 election. In 1970, Glenn won most of the counties in Ohio but lost in the counties with larger populations. The campaign changed their focus, and worked primarily in the large counties.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=328}} In the primary, Metzenbaum contrasted his strong business background with Glenns military and astronaut credentials and said that his opponent had "never held a payroll". Glenns reply became known as the "American Gold Star Mothers Gold Star Mothers" speech. He told Metzenbaum to go to a veterans hospital and "look those men with mangled bodies in the eyes and tell them they didnt hold a job. You go with me to any Gold Star mother and you look her in the eye and tell her that her son did not hold a job".
He defeated Metzenbaum 54 to 46 percent before defeating Ralph Perk (the Republican List of mayors of Cleveland mayor of Cleveland) in the general election, beginning a Senate career which would continue until 1999.{{sfn Knight 2003 p=114}}

In United States presidential election, 1976 1976, Glenn was a candidate for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination. He was considered because he was a senator in a pivotal state and for his fame and straightforwardness.
Some thought he was too much like Carter, partially because they both had military backgrounds, and that he did not have enough experience to potentially become president.
Barbara Jordan was the first keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention. Her speech electrified the crowd, and was filled with applause and standing ovations. Glenns keynote address immediately followed Jordans, and he failed to impress the delegates. Walter Cronkite described it as "dull", and other delegates complained that he was hard to hear.
Carter called Glenn to inform him the nomination was going to another candidate, and later nominated veteran politician Walter Mondale. It was also reported that Carters wife thought Annie Glenn, who had a stutter, would hurt the campaign.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=334−335}}

Betts campaign also attacked Glenns voting record, saying that he often voted for spending increases. Glenns campaigns response was that he has been a part of over 3,000 roll calls and "any one of them could be taken out of context".
Glenn was projected to win the race by a large margin.
After the votes were tallied, Glenn won by the largest margin ever for an Ohio Senator, defeating Betts by over 40 percent.{{sfn Knight 2003 p=114}}

=== 1984 presidential campaign ===

Glenn was unhappy with how divided the country was, and thought labels like conservative and liberal increased the divide. He considered himself a centrist. Glenn thought a more centrist president would help unite the country. Glenn believed his experience as an Ohioan Senator was ideal, since it has diversity.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=344}} Glenn thought that Teddy Kennedy could win the election, but after Kennedys announcement in late 1982 that he would not seek the presidency, Glenn thought he had a much better chance of winning. He hired a media consultant to help him with his speaking style.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=346}}

Glenn announced his Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1984 candidacy for president on April 21, 1983 in the John Glenn High School (New Concord, Ohio) John Glenn High School gymnasium.

He also polled the highest of any Democrat against Reagan.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=348}} During the fall of 1983, The Right Stuff (film) The Right Stuff, a film about the Mercury Seven astronauts, was released. Reviewers saw Ed Harris portrayal of Glenn as heroic and his staff began to publicize the film to the press.
One reviewer said that "Harris’ depiction helped transform Glenn from a history-book figure into a likable, thoroughly adoration-worthy Hollywood hero," turning him into a big-screen icon.
