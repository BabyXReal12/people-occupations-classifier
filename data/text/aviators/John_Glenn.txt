Colonel (United States) Colonel John Herschel Glenn Jr. (July 18, 1921&nbsp;– December 8, 2016) was a United States Marine Corps Aviation United States Marine Corps aviator, engineer, astronaut, and United States Senate United States Senator from Ohio. In 1962, he became the first American to orbit the Earth, circling it three times.

Before joining NASA, Glenn was a distinguished fighter pilot in World War II, Operation Beleaguer China and Korean War Korea. He shot down three MiG-15 aircraft, and was awarded six Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Distinguished Flying Crosses and eighteen Air Medals. In 1957, he made the first supersonic transcontinental flight across the United States. His on-board camera took the first continuous, panoramic photograph of the United States.

He was one of the Mercury Seven, military test pilots selected in 1959 by NASA as the United States first astronauts. On February 20, 1962, Glenn flew the Mercury-Atlas 6 Friendship 7 mission, becoming the first American to orbit the Earth, and the fifth person and third American in space. He received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1962 and the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978, was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1990, and was the last surviving member of the Mercury Seven.

Glenn resigned from NASA in January 1964. He planned to run for a List of United States Senators from Ohio U.S. Senate seat from Ohio, but an injury in February 1964 forced his withdrawal. He retired from the United States Marine Corps Marine Corps the following year. He lost a close Primary elections in the United States primary election in 1970. A member of the Democratic Party (United States) Democratic Party, Glenn first United States Senate election in Ohio, 1974 won election to the Senate in 1974 and served for 24 years until January 1999. In 1998, while still a sitting Senator, Glenn became the oldest person to fly in space as a crew member of the Space Shuttle Discovery Discovery space shuttle and the only person to fly in both the Mercury and Space Shuttle programs. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012.

==Military career==
===World War II===
When the Attack on Pearl Harbor Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, Glenn quit college to voluntarily enlist in the United States Army Air Corps U.S. Army Air Corps.<ref>{{youtube id=jQty14PvMaM;t=1m23s  title=John Glenn Dead at 95 &#124; Remembering the First American To Orbit Earth}}</ref> Never called to duty, he enlisted as a U.S. Navy Aviation Cadet Training Program (USN) aviation cadet in March 1942. Glenn attended the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa Iowa City for pre-flight training and continued at Naval Air Station Olathe in Kansas for primary training, where he made his first solo flight in a military aircraft. During advanced training at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas, he accepted an offer to transfer to the U.S. Marine Corps.<ref>{{cite web url=http://library.osu.edu/sites/archives/glenn/glennbio.php title=John Glenn: Biographical Sketch publisher=Ohio Statue University year=2009 archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017011820/http://library.osu.edu/sites/archives/glenn/glennbio.php archive-date=October 17, 2009}}</ref>

Having completed his flight training in March 1943, Glenn was commissioned as a second lieutenant. After advanced training at Camp Kearny, California, he was assigned to Marine Squadron VMJ-353, which flew R4D transport planes from there.{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=51–55}} Also at Camp Kearny there was a Fighter aircraft fighter squadron, VMO-155, which flew the Grumman F4F Wildcat. Glenn approached the squadrons commander, Major J. P. Haines, who suggested that he could put in for a transfer. This was approved, and Glenn was posted to VMO-155 on July 2, 1943. Two days later, the squadron moved to Marine Corps Air Station El Centro in California.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=93-96}} The Wildcat was obsolete by this time, and VMO-155 re-equipped with the Vought F4U Corsair F4U Corsair in September 1943.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=103–107}} He was promoted to First lieutenant#U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force first lieutenant in October 1943, and shipped out to Hawaii in January 1944.{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=51–55}} It was intended that VMO-155 would move to the Marshall Islands but this was delayed, and on February 21 it moved to Midway Atoll and became part of the garrison.

Glenn returned to the United States at the end of his one-year tour of duty in February 1945, and was assigned to Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina and then to Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. He was promoted to Captain (United States O-3) captain in July 1945, shortly before the end of the Pacific War war in the Pacific, but was uncertain of securing a regular commission in the Marine Corps. He was ordered back to Cherry Point, where he joined VMF-913, another Corsair squadron, and learned that he had qualified for a regular commission.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=135–141}}{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=51–55}} In March 1946, he was assigned to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in southern California. He volunteered for service with the Operation Beleaguer occupation in North China, believing that it would be a short tour. He joined VMF-218 (another Corsair squadron), which was based at Beijing Nanyuan Airport Nanyuan Field near Beijing, in December 1946,{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=147}} and flew patrol missions until VMF-218 was transferred to Guam in March 1947.

On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite. This shattered American confidence in its technological superiority, creating a wave of anxiety known as the Sputnik crisis. Among his responses, President of the United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched the Space Race. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was established on October 1, 1958, as a civilian agency to develop space technology. One of its first initiatives was publicly announced on December 17, 1958. This was Project Mercury,{{sfn Burgess 2011 pp=25–29}} which aimed to launch a man into Earth orbit, return him safely to the Earth, and evaluate his capabilities in space.{{sfn Swenson Grimwood Alexander 1966 p=134}}

While Glenn was on duty at Patuxent and in Washington, he read everything he could find about space. His office was asked to send a test pilot to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to make runs on a spaceflight simulator, as part of research by the newly formed NASA into re-entry vehicle shapes. The pilot would also be sent to the Naval Air Warfare Center Warminster Naval Air Development Center in Johnsville, Pennsylvania, and would be subjected to high G-forces in a centrifuge for comparison with data collected in the simulator. His request for the position was granted, and he spent several days at Langley and a week in Johnsville for the testing.<ref name="nasahistory">{{cite web url=https://history.nasa.gov/40thmerc7/glenn.htm title=John H.

Since he had participated in the research at Langley and Johnsville, he was sent to the McDonnell plant in St. Louis as a service adviser to NASAs spacecraft mockup board.<ref name="nasahistory" />

NASA received permission from Eisenhower to recruit its first astronauts from the ranks of military test pilots. The service records of 508 graduates of test pilot schools were obtained from the United States Department of Defense. From these, 110 were found that matched the minimum standards:{{sfn Atkinson Shafritz 1985 pp=36–39}} the candidates had to be younger than 40, possess a bachelors degree or equivalent and to be {{convert 5 ft 11 in}} or less. Only the height requirement was strictly enforced, owing to the size of the Project Mercury spacecraft.{{sfn Burgess 2011 p=35}} This was fortunate for Glenn, who barely met the requirements, as he was near the age cutoff and lacked a science-based degree.<ref name="nasajsc" /> The 110 were then split into three groups, with the most promising in the first group.{{sfn Burgess 2011 p=38}} The first group of 35, which included Alan Shepard, assembled at the Pentagon on February 2, 1959. The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, and the USAF officers were addressed by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General (United States) General Thomas D. White. Both pledged their support to the Space Program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They conceded that it would be a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance.{{sfn Burgess 2011 pp=46–51}}{{sfn Atkinson Shafritz 1985 pp=40–42}}

The briefing process was repeated with a second group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six were found to be over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six.{{sfn Atkinson Shafritz 1985 p=42}} Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute Lovelace Clinic and the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory.{{sfn Atkinson Shafritz 1985 pp=43–47}} Only one candidate, Jim Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error;{{sfn Burgess 2011 pp=234–237}} thirteen others were recommended with reservations. The director of the NASA Space Task Group, Robert R. Gilruth, found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.{{sfn Burgess 2011 pp=234–237}}

After testing, the astronaut candidates had to wait 10 to 12 days for the results. Glenn had returned to his position at the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics when he received a call from the associate director of Project Mercury, Charles Donlan, offering him a position.<ref name="nasahistory" /> The identities of the seven were announced at a press conference at Cutts–Madison House Dolley Madison House in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959:{{sfn Burgess 2011 pp=274–275}} Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton.{{sfn Atkinson Shafritz 1985 pp=42–47}} Glenn, wrote Tom Wolfe, "came out of it as tops among seven very fair-haired boys. He had the hottest record as a pilot, he was the most quotable, the most photogenic, and the lone Marine."{{sfn Wolfe 1979 p=121}} The magnitude of the challenge ahead of them was made clear a few weeks later, on the night of May 18, 1959, when the seven astronauts gathered at Cape Canaveral to watch their first rocket launch, of an SM-65D Atlas, which was similar to the one that was to carry them into orbit. A few minutes after liftoff, it spectacularly exploded, lighting up the night sky. The astronauts were stunned. Shepard turned to Glenn and said: "Well, Im glad they got that out of the way."{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=274–275}}

====Friendship 7 flight====
{{Main Mercury-Atlas 6}}
File:Friendship 7 (big).jpg thumb right Glenn entering his spacecraft, Friendship&nbsp;7, prior to the launch of Mercury-Atlas 6 on February 20, 1962.
Glenn was a backup pilot for Shepard and Grissom on the first two manned Project Mercury flights, Mercury-Redstone 3 and Mercury-Redstone 4 sub-orbital missions.<ref name="nasajsc" /> Glenn was selected for Mercury-Atlas 6, NASAs first manned orbital flight, with Carpenter as his backup. Putting a man in orbit would achieve one of Project Mercurys most important goals.{{sfn Swenson Grimwood Alexander 1966 p=407}} Shepard and Grissom had named their spacecraft Freedom 7 and Liberty Bell 7. The numeral 7 had originally been the production number of Shepards spacecraft, but had come to represent the Mercury 7. Glenn named his spacecraft, number 13, Friendship 7, and had the name hand-painted on the side like the one on his F-86 had been.{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=76–79}} Glenn and Carpenter completed their training for the mission in January 1962, but postponement of the launch allowed them to continue rehearsing. Glenn spent 25 hours and 25 minutes in the spacecraft performing hanger and altitude tests, and 59 hours and 45 minutes in the simulator. He flew 70 simulated missions and reacted to 189 simulated system failures.{{sfn Swenson Grimwood Alexander 1966 p=418}}

After a long series of delays,{{sfn Burgess 2015 pp=80–86}} Friendship 7 lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on February 20, 1962. There were eleven delays during the countdown due to equipment malfunctions and improvements and the weather. During Glenns first orbit, a failure of the automatic-control system was detected. This forced Glenn to operate in manual mode for the second and third orbits, and for re-entry. Later in the flight, telemetry indicated that the ablative heat shield heat shield had loosened. If this reading were accurate, Glenn and his spacecraft would burn up on re-entry. After a lengthy discussion on how to deal with this problem, ground controllers decided that leaving the retrorocket pack in place might help keep the loose heat shield in place. They relayed these instructions to Glenn, but did not tell him that the heat shield was possibly loose; although confused at this order, he complied. Leaving the retrorocket pack on made large chunks of flaming debris fly past the window of his capsule during re-entry, which Glenn thought might have been the heat shield. He told an interviewer, "Fortunately it was the rocket pack—or I wouldnt be answering these questions."<ref name="nasaambass" /> After the flight, it was determined that the heat shield was not loose, but rather that the sensor was faulty.<ref name=CBS />

=== 1984 presidential campaign ===

Glenn was unhappy with how divided the country was, and thought labels like conservative and liberal increased the divide. He considered himself a centrist. Glenn thought a more centrist president would help unite the country. Glenn believed his experience as an Ohioan Senator was ideal, since it has diversity.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=344}} Glenn thought that Teddy Kennedy could win the election, but after Kennedys announcement in late 1982 that he would not seek the presidency, Glenn thought he had a much better chance of winning.

==Senate career==
===Committee on Governmental Affairs===

Glenn requested to be assigned to two committees during his inaugural year as senator: the United States Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs Government Operations Committee (later known as the Committee on Governmental Affairs), and the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Foreign Relations Committee. He was immediately assigned to the Government Operations Committee, and waited for a seat on the Foreign Relations Committee.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=333}} In 1977, Glenn wanted to chair the Energy, Nuclear Proliferation, and Federal Services Subcommittee of the Governmental Affairs Committee. Abraham Ribicoff, chair of the Governmental Affairs Committee, said he could chair the subcommittee if he also chaired the less popular Federal Services Subcommittee, which was in charge of the U.S. Postal Service. Although previous chairs of the Federal Services Subcommittee lost elections due in part to negative campaigns that tied in the poorly regarded mail service with the chairmen, Glenn accepted the offer and became the chair of both subcommittees.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18926537/newsjournal/ title=Glenn in Postal Dilemma last1=Thomas first1=Richard newspaper=News-Journal location=Mansfield, Ohio date=June 25, 1978 page=46 via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> One of his goals as a freshman senator was developing environmental policies.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18925967/the_tampa_tribune/ title=Glenn eyes sound energy policies newspaper=The Tampa Tribune location=Tampa, Florida date=January 13, 1975 page=6}}</ref> Glenn introduced bills on energy policy to try to counter the 1970s energy crisis energy crisis in the 70s.

Glenn was made aware of the problem at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center near Cincinnati, and soon found that it was an issue that occurred at several sites around the nation.

He also released a report on the potential costs of hazardous waste cleanup at former nuclear weapons manufacturing facilities, known as the Glenn Report.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18916124/the_santa_fe_new_mexican/ title=Lab face costly, complex problems in cleanup of hazardous waste sites newspaper=The Santa Fe New Mexican date=August 15, 1988 page=3 via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste left at the facilities.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18915967/the_akron_beacon_journal/ title=Glenn irate over N-plant cleanup last1=Hershey first1=William newspaper=The Akron Beacon Journal location=Akron, Ohio date=January 10, 1989 page=3 via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>

Glenn also focused on reducing government waste. He created legislation to mandate CFOs for large governmental agencies, and added more inspectors general to identify excessive government spending.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=353}}

In 1995 Glenn became the ranking minority member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs. Glenn disputed the focus of 1996 United States campaign finance controversy illegal Chinese donations to the Democrats, and asserted that Republicans also had egregious fundraising issues.

Glenn was considered an expert in matters of science and technology due to his background. He was a supporter of continuing the Rockwell B-1 Lancer B-1 bomber program, which he considered successful. This conflicted with President Carters desire to fund the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit B-2 bomber program. Glenn did not fully support development of the B-2 because he had doubts about the feasibility of the stealth technology. He drafted a proposal to slow down the development of the B-2, which could have potentially saved money, but the measure was rejected.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18916397/the_indianapolis_news/ title=Senate panel votes against slowing Stealth newspaper=The Indianapolis News location=Indianapolis, Indiana date=July 14, 1989 page=29 via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>

Glenn joined the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Foreign Relations Committee in 1978.

Glenn helped to pass the Taiwan Relations Act Taiwan Enabling Act of 1979. The same year, Glenns stance on the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks SALT II treaty caused another dispute with President Carter. Due to the loss of radar listening posts in Iran, Glenn did not believe that the U.S. had the capability to monitor the Soviet Union accurately enough to verify compliance with the treaty.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 p=342}} During the launching ceremony for the {{USS Ohio SSGN-726 6}}, he spoke about his doubts about verifying treaty compliance.

In 1995, Glenn was reading Space Physiology and Medicine, a book written by NASA doctors. He realized that many changes that occur to physical attributes during space flight, such as loss of bone and muscle mass and blood plasma,<ref name="Interview"/> are the same as changes that occur due to aging. Glenn thought NASA should send an older person on a shuttle mission, and thought that it should be him. Starting in 1995, he began lobbying NASA director Dan Goldin for the mission.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=358−360}} Goldin said he would consider it if there was a scientific reason, and if Glenn could pass the same physical examination the younger astronauts took. Glenn performed research on the subject, and passed the physical examination. On January 16, 1998, NASA Administrator Dan Goldin announced that Glenn would be part of the STS-95 crew;<ref name="nasahistory" /> this made him, at age 77, the oldest person to fly in space.{{sfn Glenn Taylor 1999 pp=364−366}}

NASA and the National Institute of Aging (NIA) planned to use Glenn as a test subject for research, with biometrics taken before, during and after his flight. Some experiments (in circadian rhythms, for example) compared him with the younger crew members. In addition to these tests, he was in charge of the flights photography and videography.
