The couple appeared to have a happy marriage and had two daughters together, presenting a united outward appearance during the late 1980s. His wifes personal qualities were seen as refreshing in the context of the formal protocol surrounding the Royal Family. However, the Duke of Yorks frequent travel due to his military career, as well as relentless, often critical, media attention focused on the Duchess of York, led to fractures in the marriage. On 19 March 1992, the couple announced plans to separate and did so in an amicable way.<ref>{{cite web url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/19/newsid_2543000/2543667.stm title=

The marriage was ended in divorce on 30 May 1996. The Duke of York spoke fondly of his former wife: "We have managed to work together to bring our children up in a way that few others have been able to and I am extremely grateful to be able to do that."<ref>{{Cite news  last=Castle  first=Stephen  title=From Prince Andrew, critical words for U.S. on Iraq  newspaper=The New York Times   date=4 February 2008  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/world/americas/04iht-andrew.4.9735778.html?_r=1 }}</ref>

The couple agreed to share custody of their two daughters, and the Duchess continued to live at the Dukes home, Sunninghill Park, until 2004, when he moved to the Royal Lodge. In 2003, Richard Kay, in his first gossip column for the Daily Mail, asserted that the Duke was about to marry the businesswoman Amanda Staveley. She was reported in The Sunday Telegraph as saying, "I will not be marrying Andrew now or in the future." In 2007, Sarah, Duchess of York, purchased Dolphin House, a mansion directly beside the Royal Lodge. In 2008, a fire at Dolphin House resulted in Sarah moving into the Royal Lodge, again sharing a house with the Duke of York. Prince Andrews lease of Royal Lodge is for 75 years, with the Crown Estate as landlord, and there is no annual tenancy charge.<ref>National Audit Office report, 2005.

In May 2010, Sarah, Duchess of York, was filmed by a News of the World reporter claiming that her former husband had agreed that if she were to receive £500,000, he would meet the donor and pass on useful top-level business contacts. She was filmed receiving, in cash, $40,000 as a down payment.

==Controversies==

===Alleged comments on corruption and Kazakhstan===
As the United Kingdoms Special Trade Representative, the Duke of York travelled the world to promote British businesses. It was revealed in the United States diplomatic cables leak that the Duke had been reported on by Tatiana Gfoeller, the United States Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, discussing bribery in Kyrgyzstan and the investigation into the Al-Yamamah arms deal. The Duke, she explained, "was referencing an investigation, subsequently closed, into alleged kickbacks a senior Saudi royal had received in exchange for the multi-year, lucrative BAE Systems contract to provide equipment and training to Saudi security forces." The dispatch continued: "His mothers subjects seated around the table roared their approval. He then went on to these (expletive) journalists, especially from The Guardian the National Guardian {{sic}}, who poke their noses everywhere and (presumably) make it harder for British businessmen to do business. The crowd practically clapped!"

Earlier in 2010, it was revealed that the Kazakhstan Presidents billionaire son-in-law Timur Kulibayev paid the Duke of Yorks representatives £15 million – £3 million over the asking price – via offshore companies, for the Dukes Surrey mansion, Sunninghill Park. Kulibayev frequently appears in US dispatches as one of the men who have accumulated millions in gas-rich Kazakhstan.<ref>{{cite news  url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/nov/29/wikileaks-cables-rude-prince-andrew  location=London  work=The Guardian   first1=David   last1=Leigh   first2=Rob   last2=Evans   first3=Heather   last3=Brooke   title=WikiLeaks cables: Rude Prince Andrew shocks US ambassador   date=29 November 2010}}</ref>

In May 2016, a fresh controversy broke out when the Daily Mail alleged that the Duke had brokered a deal to assist a Greek and Swiss consortium secure a £385 million contract to build water and sewerage networks in two of Kazakhstans largest cities, while working as British trade envoy, and had stood to gain a £4 million payment in commission.<ref>{{cite news last=Adams first= Guy  title=Andrew and a £4m kickback: Duke brokered £385m deal for Greek firm and corrupt regime while acting as British trade envoy...

===Arms sales===
In March 2011 Kaye Stearman of the Campaign Against the Arms Trade told Channel 4 News CAAT sees Prince Andrew as part of a bigger problem, "He is the front man for UK Trade & Investment UKTI. Our concerns are not just Prince Andrew, its the whole UKTI set up. They see arms as just another commodity but it has completely disproportionate resources. At the London office of UKTI the arms sector has more staff than all the others put together.  We are concerned that Prince Andrew is used to sell arms, and where you sell arms it is likely to be to despotic regimes. He is the cheerleader in chief for the arms industry, shaking hands and paving the way for the salesmen."<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/news/prince-andrew-cheerleader-in-chief-for-the-arms-industry "Prince Andrew: Cheerleader in chief for the arms industry"]. Channel 4 News. 10 March 2011.</ref>

In January 2014 Prince Andrew took part in a delegation to Bahrain.  Spokesman for CAAT, Andrew Smith said, "We are calling on Prince Andrew and the UK government to stop selling arms to Bahrain. By endorsing the Bahraini dictatorship Prince Andrew is giving his implicit support to their oppressive practices.  When our government sells arms it is giving moral and practical support to an illegitimate and authoritarian regime and directly supporting their systematic crackdown on opposition groups. (...) We shouldnt allow our international image to be used as a PR tool for the violent and oppressive dictatorship in Bahrain."<ref>[https://www.caat.org.uk/media/press-releases/2014-01-15 "Campaigners call for UK to halt arms exports to Bahrain as Prince Andrew joins sales drive"].

Andrew Smith has also said, "The prince has consistently used his position to promote arms sales and boost some of the most unpleasant governments in the world, his arms sales haven’t just given military support to corrupt and repressive regimes. Theyve lent those regimes political and international legitimacy."<ref>{{cite web url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/1/17/prince-andrew-britainelites.html title=What Scandal Involving Prince Andrew Says - Al Jazeera America publisher= accessdate=19 April 2016}}</ref>
