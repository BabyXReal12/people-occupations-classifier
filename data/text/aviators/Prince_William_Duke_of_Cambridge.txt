William was educated at independent school (United Kingdom) independent schools, starting at Jane Mynors nursery school and the pre-preparatory Wetherby School, both in London.<ref>{{cite web title=Wetherby Pre-Preparatory School url=http://www.londonpreprep.com/schools/boys/wetherby-school/ publisher=London Pre-Prep accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref> Following this, he attended Ludgrove School near Wokingham, Berkshire, and was privately tutored during summers by Rory Stewart.<ref>{{Cite news  url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/26/rory-stewart-penrith-tory-seat  location=London  work= The Guardian   first=Allegra   last=Stratton   title=Former royal tutor Rory Stewart selected for safe Tory seat   date=26 October 2009}}</ref> At Ludgrove, he participated in association football football, swimming, basketball, clay pigeon shooting, and cross country running.

The decision to place William in Eton went against the family tradition of sending royal children to Gordonstoun, which Williams grandfather, father, two uncles, and two cousins all attended. Dianas father and brother both attended Eton.<ref name="people1" /> The Royal Family and the tabloid press agreed William would be allowed to study free from intrusion in exchange for regular updates about his life. The chairman of the Press Complaints Commission John Wakeham said of the arrangement, "Prince William is not an institution; nor a soap star; nor a football hero. He is a boy: in the next few years, perhaps the most important and sometimes painful part of his life, he will grow up and become a man."<ref name="people1" />

===Military training and secondments===
Having decided to follow a military career, in October 2005 William attended the four-day Army Officer Selection Board Regular Commissions Board at Westbury, Wiltshire Westbury in Wiltshire, where he underwent selection to judge his suitability to become an army officer. He passed selection and was admitted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in January 2006.<ref>{{Cite news  url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1501217/Prince-William-to-join-his-brother-at-Sandhurst.html  work= The Daily Telegraph  location=London   title=Prince William to join his brother at Sandhurst   first=Caroline   last=Davies   date=22 October 2005   accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> After completing the course, William was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant at Sandhurst on 15 December 2006; the graduation parade was attended by the Queen and the Prince of Wales, along with other members of the Royal Family. William officially received his commission as a Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines) lieutenant at midnight. As "Lieutenant Wales"—a name based on his fathers title Prince of Wales—he followed his younger brother<ref>{{cite news  author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5367862.stm  title=William joining Harrys regiment  publisher=BBC News  date=21 September 2006  accessdate=17 November 2010}}</ref> into the Blues and Royals as a troop commander in an armoured reconnaissance unit, after which he spent four months training for the post at Bovington Camp, Dorset.

Though Major-General (United Kingdom) Major-General Sir Sebastian Roberts, General Officer commanding the Household Division, had said Williams deployment was possible, the Princes position as second-in-line to the throne and the convention of ministers advising against placing that person into dangerous situations cast doubts on Williams chances of seeing combat. These doubts increased after Prince Harrys deployment was cancelled in 2007 due to "specific threats". William, instead, went on to train in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, obtaining his commission as a sub-lieutenant in the former and flying officer in the latter—both broadly equivalent to the army rank of lieutenant. After completing his training, William undertook an attachment with the Royal Air Force, undergoing an intensive, four-month training course at RAF Cranwell.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=217  title=Prince William ready for Search and Rescue role  publisher=meeja.com.au  date=16 September 2008  accessdate=16 September 2008  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019214531/http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=217  archivedate=19 October 2008  df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="Pierce">{{Cite news  url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/4218703/Prince-William-starts-as-a-search-and-rescue-helicopter-pilot.html  title=Prince William starts as a search and rescue helicopter pilot  accessdate=18 January 2009  last=Pierce  first=Andrew  date=13 January 2009  work= The Daily Telegraph  location=London }}</ref> Upon completing the course on 11 April 2008, he was presented with his Aircrew brevet RAF wings by his father,<ref name="smh1">{{Cite news author = Staff   url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/kate-watches-william-get-his-wings/2008/04/12/1207856847954.html  title=Kate watches William get his wings   publisher = Deutsche Presse-Agentur (via The Sydney Morning Herald)  date=12 April 2008 accessdate= 26 July 2013}}</ref> who had received his own wings after training at Cranwell.<ref>{{cite news  author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7340692.stm  title=Prince William awarded RAF wings  publisher=BBC News  date=11 April 2008  accessdate=2 July 2008}}</ref> During this secondment, William flew to Afghanistan in a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III C-17 Globemaster that repatriated the body of Trooper Robert Pearson.<ref>{{cite news  author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7374589.stm  title=William visits Afghanistan troops  publisher=BBC News  date=30 April 2008  accessdate=30 August 2008}}</ref>

Because of Williams future royal role, a long-term career in the military was considered out-of-the-question; due to his position, his desire to see active service was unlikely to be fulfilled. William originally joined the military on a short-service commission lasting three years. It was announced in September 2008, however, that he would be extending his forces career in 2008 by accepting another secondment that included working at the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) Ministry of Defence (MOD) and non-operational flying with the Army Air Corps.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/prince_william_military_secondments_in_autumn_2008_1233465855.html title=Prince William: Military Secondments in Autumn, 2008 date=31 July 2008 publisher=princeofwales.gov.uk accessdate=30 August 2008 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915053013/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/prince_william_military_secondments_in_autumn_2008_1233465855.html archivedate=15 September 2008 df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was later announced that he would transfer from the Army to the RAF to train as a full-time search and rescue helicopter pilot, a role that would enable him to take an active role in the armed forces without being deployed on combat operations.

==Personal life==

===Bachelorhood===
As with his father, Williams private life became the subject of tabloid speculation, especially around his relationship with Catherine Middleton, who had been one of Williams university Roommate flatmates and whom William began dating in 2003. Middleton attended Williams passing-out parade at Sandhurst, which was the first high-profile event that she attended as his guest. The relationship between them was followed so closely that bookmakers took bets on the possibility of marriage, and the retail chain Woolworths Group Woolworths produced Souvenir memorabilia bearing the likenesses of the couple.<ref name="CTV Split">{{cite news  author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/prince-william-girlfriend-end-their-relationship-1.237322  title=Prince William, girlfriend end their relationship  publisher=CTV News  date=14 April 2007  accessdate=16 October 2008}}</ref> Media attention became so intense that William formally  asked the press to keep their distance from Middleton.<ref name="CTV Split" />

It was reported in April 2007 that the couple had split,<ref name="CTV Split" /> though Middleton, in June, attended a party at Lulworth Camp as a guest of Prince William and in July the Concert for Diana, which had been organised by Princes William and Harry. In subsequent months, she accompanied William on holiday and joined the Royal Family on private outings and at public events.

As a British prince, William does not use a surname for everyday purposes. For formal and ceremonial purposes, the children of the Prince of Wales use the title of "prince" or "princess" before their Christian name and their fathers territorial designation after it. Thus, Prince William was styled as "Prince William of Wales". Such territorial designations are discarded by women when they marry and by men if they are given a peerage of their own,<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5657.asp  title=Titles and succession: Royal Family name publisher=Royal archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804094423/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5657.asp  archivedate=4 August 2008 accessdate=15 October 2008}}</ref> such as when Prince William was given his dukedom.

For the male-line grandchildren of Elizabeth II, however, there is currently some uncertainty over the correct form of family surname to use, or even whether there is a surname. The Queen has stipulated that all her male-line descendants "who do not bear the titular dignity of prince" shall use Mountbatten-Windsor as their family surname (although Letters Patent exist stipulating the name Windsor, but with the same caveat). Princes William and Harry both used Wales as their surname for military purposes; this continues to be the case for William since his creation as Duke of Cambridge.<ref name="Duke of Cambridge, Flt Lt Wales">{{cite web url=http://www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org/news-and-diary/working-day-the-life-of-flight-lieutenant-wales  title=A working day in the life of Flight Lieutenant Wales  publisher=Clarence House  date=20 November 2012  accessdate=30 January 2013  quote=The Duke of Cambridge – who is known in his Royal Air Force working life as Flight Lieutenant Wales  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130091753/http://www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org/news-and-diary/working-day-the-life-of-flight-lieutenant-wales  archivedate=30 January 2013  df= }}</ref>

Via his mother, William descends from: the Earl Spencer (peerage) Earls Spencer (a cadet branch of the Spencer family, descended from the Earl of Sunderland Earls of Sunderland; the senior branch are now also Duke of Marlborough (title) Dukes of Marlborough); the Baron Fermoy Barons Fermoy; and more anciently from Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, and Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, two of the illegitimate sons of King Charles II of England Charles II. As king, William would be the first monarch since Anne, Queen of Great Britain Anne to descend from Charles I of England Charles I, and the first to descend from Charles II.<ref name="TOI" /><ref name="williamson"/>

William descends Matrilineality matrilineally from Eliza Kewark, a housekeeper for his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Theodore Forbes, a Scottish merchant who worked for the East India Company in Surat. She is variously described in contemporary documents as "a dark-skinned native woman", "an Armenian woman from Bombay", and "Mrs. Forbesian".<ref name="williamson">Williamson, D (1981) "The Ancestry of Lady Diana Spencer".
