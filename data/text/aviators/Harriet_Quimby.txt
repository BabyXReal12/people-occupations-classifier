The Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome possesses a flyable Anzani-powered one-seater Blériot XI, which bears the Blériot factorys serial number 56, showing that it was manufactured in 1909. Since Quimbys plane, in 1912, was a brand new two-seater, the idea that the former was the aircraft that she was flying in 1912 seems to be an urban legend.<ref>{{cite web author=Pat Trenner title=Did Harriet Quimby’s Blériot End Up in New York? url=http://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/did-harriet-quimbys-bleriot-end-up-in-new-york-22770842/ publisher=airspacemag date=April 15, 2013 accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref>
