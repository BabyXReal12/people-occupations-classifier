==Career==

===Early years===
By September 1949 and using her new name, Oliver returned to the East Coast of the United States East Coast to begin drama studies at Swarthmore College, followed by professional training at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City. After working in summer stock, regional theater and in unbilled bits in daytime and primetime TV shows and commercials, she made her first major television appearance in a supporting role in the July 31, 1955, episode of the live drama series Goodyear TV Playhouse, and quickly progressed to leading parts in other shows.

Oliver did numerous TV shows in 1957, and appeared on stage. She began the year with an Ingenue (stock character) ingenue part, as the daughter of an 18th-century Manhattan family, in her first Broadway play, Small War on Murray Hill, a Robert E. Sherwood comedy.<ref>The plays opening night at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre was on January 3, 1957, and, 12 performances later, closing night was January 12. Leo Genn as General Howe</ref> That same year, Oliver replaced Mary Ure as the female lead in the Broadway production of John Osbornes play Look Back in Anger.

The plays short run was immediately followed by larger roles in live TV plays on Kaiser Aluminum Hour, The United States Steel Hour and Matinee Theater. Oliver then went to Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Hollywood, where she appeared in the November 14, 1957, episode of Climax! (TV series) Climax!, one of the few live drama series based on the West Coast of the United States West Coast, as well as in a number of filmed shows, including one of the first episodes of NBCs Wagon Train, Father Knows Best, The Americans (1961 TV series) The Americans, and Johnny Staccato.

In July 1957, Oliver was chosen for the title role in her first motion picture, The Green-Eyed Blonde, a low-budget independent film independent melodrama scripted by Dalton Trumbo (under a pseudonym), and released by Warner Bros. in December on the bottom half of a double bill.<ref>The film was scripted by Hollywood blacklist blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo and credited to "Hollywood blacklist front" Sally Stubblefield.</ref> It is the only motion picture on which Oliver received top billing.

In mid-1958, Oliver began rehearsals for a co-starring role in Patate, her second Broadway play.<ref>The melancholy comedy, written by France French playwright Marcel Achard, played to sold-out theaters in Paris upon its premiere in 1957. Adapted for American audiences by Irwin Shaw, Patate (which in French language French means "Wiktionary:spud spud", but can also mean "Wiktionary:chump chump") paired Oliver with veteran leading man Tom Ewell (in the title role) and Lee Bowman. The play opened at Henry Millers Theatre on October 28, 1958, and closed on November 1.</ref> Its seven performance run was even shorter than that of Small War on Murray Hill, but won Oliver a Theatre World Award for "Outstanding Breakout Performance;" it was her last Broadway appearance.

Oliver was cast in the 1960 episode of The Deputy (TV series) The Deputy as the long-lost daughter of star Henry Fondas late girl friend, and appeared in Dick Powells Zane Grey Theatre episode "Knife of Hate" as Susan Pittman. In 1961, Oliver played the part of Laurie Evans in the episode "Incident of His Brothers Keeper" on CBSs Rawhide (TV series) Rawhide, and in 1963, she played Judy Hall in the episode "Incident at Spider Rock", Also in 1962 Oliver appeared as Jeanie in the television series Laramie (TV series) Laramie in the episode "Shadows in the Dust".

Oliver was cast in episodes of Adventures in Paradise (TV series) Adventures in Paradise, The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series) Twilight Zone, Route 66 (TV series) Route 66, Dr. Kildare, The Naked City, The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Burkes Law (1963 TV series) Burkes Law, The Fugitive (TV series) The Fugitive, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., I Spy (1965 TV series) I Spy, The Virginian (TV series) The Virginian, and The Name of the Game (TV series) The Name of the Game. She made one appearance on The Andy Griffith Show and ABCs family western series, The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters (TV series) The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters.

Her most challenging role during this time was as the ambitious wife of doomed country music legend Hank Williams (George Hamilton) in Your Cheatin Heart (film) Your Cheatin Heart (1964). The same year she also starred opposite Jerry Lewis in The Disorderly Orderly, and also appeared in The Man from U.N.C.L.E (1965), and The Love-Ins (1967) with Richard Todd.

Oliver appeared in television films including Carters Army. Oliver had a continuing role as Ann Howard on American Broadcasting Company ABCs prime-time serial Peyton Place (TV series) Peyton Place in 1966.

Oliver played the female lead character Vina in "The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series) The Cage" (1964), which was the first pilot of Gene Roddenberrys new show, Star Trek: The Original Series Star Trek. Two years later, Olivers performance was re-used in the first season, two-part episode "The Menagerie (Star Trek: The Original Series) The Menagerie" (1966). The framing device was needed because of significant format and cast changes, in particular Jeffrey Hunter played "Captain Christopher Pike" in the pilot episode, but William Shatner became the new captain of the Starship Enterprise when the series was green-lit in 1966.
For the fantasy sequence in the pilot, in which her character appeared as an "Orion slave girl", Oliver was covered in green makeup all over her body, and a dark brunette wig.<ref name=asherman>{{cite book last=Asherman first=Allan title=The Star Trek Compendium publisher=WH Allen, Star Books year=1983 page=28}}</ref> A still of her with green skin is frequently seen in the end credits of the TV series, and it became an iconic image of Star Trek.

By the late 1970s with acting assignments becoming scarcer, Oliver turned to directing.

==Aviator and author==
Oliver experienced an event in February 1959 that underscored her later aviation accomplishments. She was a passenger aboard Pan Am Flight 115, a Boeing 707 on a transatlantic flight from Paris to New York City when it dropped from {{convert 35000 ft}} to {{convert 6000 ft}}. It was February 3, 1959, the same day Buddy Holly died in an airplane crash. These events caused her to avoid flying for the next year, even turning down job offers (with the exception of auditioning for BUtterfield 8) if they were so short notice she could only travel by air. She eventually underwent hypnosis to overcome her fear of flying.<ref name=odyssey/>

In July 1964, Hal Fishman introduced her to personal flying when he took her on an evening flight over Los Angeles in a Cessna 172.<ref name=odyssey>{{cite book last=Oliver first=Susan title=Odyssey: A Daring Transatlantic Journey publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co. year=1983 isbn=0-02-592920-8}}</ref> The experience motivated her to return the next day to the Santa Monica Airport to begin training for a Private Pilot certificate. In 1966, while preparing for her own transatlantic flight, she was a passenger in a Piper J-3 Cub when the pilot ran into wires while "show-boating";<ref name=odyssey /> the airplane flipped and crashed. She and the pilot escaped injury.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief.aspx?ev_id=75958&key=0 title=NTSB No. LAX67D0086 publisher=}}</ref>

In 1967, piloting her own Aero Commander 200, she became the fourth<!--History records Amelia Earhart as the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, she did it alone in a Lockheed Vega in 1932. Gerry Mock did it in 1964 in a Cessna 180 as part of the first solo round-the-world flight by a woman. Sheila Scott did it in 1966, also as part of a solo round the world flight, her transatlantic segment departed from New York.--> woman to fly a single-engine aircraft solo across the Atlantic Ocean and the second to do it from New York City. Although she was attempting to fly to Moscow, her odyssey ended in Denmark after the government of the Soviet Union denied her permission to enter its air space. She wrote about her aviation exploits and philosophy of life in an autobiography published in 1983.<ref name=odyssey/>

In 1968, she was contacted by Learjet to see if she was interested in getting a type rating in one of their jets with the intent to set record flights for them. She earned the rating and even flew some charters (having by that time acquired a commercial pilot certificate in single and multiengine land airplanes), but did not fly any record flights in their jets.<ref name=odyssey/>

In 1970, Oliver co-piloted a Piper PA-24 Comanche Piper Comanche to victory in the 2760-mile transcontinental race known as the "Powder Puff Derby (1947) Powder Puff Derby", which resulted in her being named Pilot of the Year. The pilot was Margaret Mead (not the famous anthropologist), an experienced pilot who had flown in several derbies with different co-pilots. In 1972, her training for a glider rating was chronicled for an episode of the television series The American Sportsman and the segment aired in March 1973.<ref>[https://newspaperarchive.com/robesonian/1973-03-18/page-27 Robesonian newspaper archives], March 18, 1973; accessed March 7, 2015.</ref>

According to the FAA Registry, the glider rating was issued to Oliver on July 21, 1972. It was her last rating. The Registry shows her to have earned commercial pilot ratings for airplane single engine land, airplane multiengine land, instrument airplane, and private privileges for glider. Her last aviation medical exam was in May 1976; therefore, she could not legally pilot any aircraft except gliders after May 1978, marking the end of her piloting of powered aircraft.<ref>[https://amsrvs.registry.faa.gov/airmeninquiry Profile], amsrvs.registry.faa.gov; accessed March 7, 2015.</ref>

==Death==
Oliver was diagnosed with colorectal cancer that later metastasized to her lungs and she died on May 10, 1990 at the Motion Picture & Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, California.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/15/obituaries/susan-oliver-is-dead-television-actress-61.html title=Susan Oliver Is Dead; Television Actress newspaper=New York Times date=1990-05-15 accessdate=January 27, 2012}}</ref>
