Oliver played the female lead character Vina in "The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series) The Cage" (1964), which was the first pilot of Gene Roddenberrys new show, Star Trek: The Original Series Star Trek. Two years later, Olivers performance was re-used in the first season, two-part episode "The Menagerie (Star Trek: The Original Series) The Menagerie" (1966). The framing device was needed because of significant format and cast changes, in particular Jeffrey Hunter played "Captain Christopher Pike" in the pilot episode, but William Shatner became the new captain of the Starship Enterprise when the series was green-lit in 1966.
For the fantasy sequence in the pilot, in which her character appeared as an "Orion slave girl", Oliver was covered in green makeup all over her body, and a dark brunette wig.

==Aviator and author==
Oliver experienced an event in February 1959 that underscored her later aviation accomplishments. She was a passenger aboard Pan Am Flight 115, a Boeing 707 on a transatlantic flight from Paris to New York City when it dropped from {{convert 35000 ft}} to {{convert 6000 ft}}. It was February 3, 1959, the same day Buddy Holly died in an airplane crash. These events caused her to avoid flying for the next year, even turning down job offers (with the exception of auditioning for BUtterfield 8) if they were so short notice she could only travel by air. She eventually underwent hypnosis to overcome her fear of flying.
