Coxs Sport Pilot Certificate is for an ERCO Ercoupe ERCO 415-C Ercoupe which the Federal Aviation Administration has designated a light sport aircraft. Designed in the 1940s, the Ercoupe was built without rudder pedals. Instead, the rudder is interconnected with the ailerons through the Yoke (aeronautics) yoke. This unique design allows Cox to control the airplane with one foot controlling the yoke while the other foot controls the throttle.<ref>EAA. (24 July 2015).
