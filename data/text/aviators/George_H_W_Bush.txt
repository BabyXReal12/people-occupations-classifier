A member of the Republican Party (United States) Republican Party, he had previously been a Congressman, Ambassador and Director of Central Intelligence. During his career in public sector public service, he was known simply as George Bush; since 2001, he has often been referred to as "George H. W.

He served until September 1945, then attended Yale University. Graduating in 1948, he moved his family to West Texas, where he entered the oil business and became a millionaire by the age of 40 in 1964. Soon after founding his own oil company, Bush became involved in politics and won election to the United States House of Representatives House of Representatives from Texas 7th congressional district Texas 7th district in 1966. In 1971, President Richard Nixon appointed Bush as United States Ambassador to the United Nations Ambassador to the United Nations, and in 1973, Bush became the Chairman of the Republican National Committee.

Bush ran for president in United States presidential election, 1980 1980 but was defeated in the Republican Party presidential primaries, 1980 Republican primary by Ronald Reagan.

Though the agreement was not ratified until after he left office, Bush also signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which created a trade bloc consisting of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Domestically, Bush Read my lips: no new taxes reneged on a 1988 campaign promise and, after a struggle with Congress, signed an increase in taxes that Congress had passed. In the wake of a weak recovery from an Early 1990s recession economic recession, along with continuing budget deficits and the diminution of foreign politics as a major issue in a post-Cold War political climate, he lost the United States presidential election, 1992 1992 presidential election to Democrat Bill Clinton.

==Faith==
Bushs Christian faith was shaped by his upbringing in the Episcopal Church (United States) Episcopal Church, though by the end of his life his apparent religious beliefs have been considered more in line with Evangelical Christian doctrine and practices. Several key moments in Bushs life led to a deepening of his faith in Jesus Christ, including his narrow escape from Japanese forces in 1944 and the tragic death of his three-year-old child, Robin, in 1953. This strong faith would inspire many themes that later would become apparent in his public life, such as his Thousand Points of Light speech, his support for prayer in schools, and his strong support of the pro-life movement.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/the-faith-of-george-h-w-bush-189108/ title=The Faith of George HW Bush author=Gary S.

Bush and the Harris County Republicans played a role in the development of the new Republican Party of the late 20th century. First, Bush worked to absorb the John Birch Society members, who were trying to take over the Republican Party. Second, during and after the civil rights movement, Democrats in the South who were committed to racial segregation segregation left their party, and although the "country club Republicans" had differing ideological beliefs, they found common ground in hoping to expel the Democrats from power.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/bush-transcript/  title=Program Transcript.

President Gerald Ford appointed Bush to be Chief of the De facto embassy#China and the United States U.S. Liaison Office in the Peoples Republic of China. Since the United States at the time maintained official relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan and not the Peoples Republic of China, the Liaison Office did not have the official status of an embassy and Bush did not formally hold the position of "ambassador", though he unofficially acted as one. The 14 months that he spent in China were largely seen as beneficial for U.S.-China relations.<ref name="ea"/>

After Ford assumed the presidency, Bush was under serious consideration for being nominated as vice president. Ford eventually narrowed his list to Nelson Rockefeller and Bush.

At the outset of the Republican Party presidential primaries, 1980 1980 primary race, Bush focused heavily on winning the January 21 Iowa caucuses; five months earlier he had won the Iowa Straw Poll. Reagan, however, far ahead in the polls, campaigned little. Bush represented the centrist wing in the GOP, whereas Reagan represented conservatives. Bush famously labeled Reagans supply-side economics supply side-influenced plans for massive tax cuts "Reaganomics voodoo economics". His strategy proved useful, to some degree, as he won in Iowa with 31.5% to Reagans 29.4%. After the win, Bush stated that his campaign was full of momentum, or "the Big Mo".

As a result of the loss, Reagan replaced his campaign manager, reorganized his staff, and concentrated on the New Hampshire primary. The two men agreed to a debate in the state, organized by the Nashua Telegraph, but paid for by the Reagan campaign. Reagan invited the other four candidates as well, but Bush refused to debate them, and eventually they left. The debate proved to be a pivotal moment in the campaign; when the moderator, John Breen, ordered Reagans microphone turned off, his angry response, "I am paying for this microphone," struck a chord with the public. Bush ended up losing New Hampshires primary with 23% to Reagans 50%. Bush lost most of the remaining primaries as well, and formally dropped out of the race in May of that year.<ref name="senate"/>

===First term, 1981–1985===
As vice president, Bush generally maintained a typically low profile while he recognized the constitutional limits of the office; he avoided decision-making or criticizing Reagan in any way. As had become customary, he and his wife moved into the Vice Presidents residence at Number One Observatory Circle, about two miles from the White House. After selling the house in Tanglewood, Houston Tanglewood, the Bushes declared a room in The Houstonian Hotel in Houston as their official voting address.<ref name=Hickey/> The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions, including many state funerals, which became a common joke for comedians. Mrs. Bush found the funerals largely beneficial, saying, "George met with many current or future heads of state at the funerals he attended, enabling him to forge personal relationships that were important to President Reagan." As the President of the Senate, Bush stayed in contact with members of Congress and kept the president informed on occurrences on Capitol Hill.<ref name="senate"/>

In the January 26, 1987, issue of Time (magazine) Time magazine, journalist Robert Ajemian reported in an article entitled "Where Is the Real George Bush?" that one of Bushs friends had urged him to spend several days at Camp David thinking through his plans for his prospective presidency.

As early as 1985, Bush had been planning a presidential run; he entered the Republican primary for President of the United States in October 1987.<ref name="senate"/> His challengers for the Republican presidential nomination included U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, U.S. Representative Jack Kemp of New York, former Governor Pete DuPont of Delaware, and conservative Christian televangelist Pat Robertson.

Following the primary, Bush and Dole had a joint media appearance, when the interviewer asked Dole if he had anything to say to Bush, Dole said, in response to the ads, "yeah, stop lying about my record!" in an angry tone.

Bush continued seeing victory, winning many Southern primaries as well.<ref name="ea"/> Once the multiple-state primaries such as Super Tuesday began, Bushs organizational strength and fundraising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match, and the nomination was his.<ref name="msn"/>

As the 1988 Republican National Convention approached, there was much speculation who Bush would choose to be his running mate. He selected little-known U.S. Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana, who was favored by conservatives. Despite Reagans popularity, Bush trailed Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, then Governor of Massachusetts, in most polls.<ref name="npr">{{cite web url=https://www.npr.org/news/national/election2000/conventions/past.bushsenior.html title=1988: George H.

Bush was occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence when compared to Reagan, but he delivered a well-received speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention. Known as the "thousand points of light" speech, the presentation described Bushs vision of America. He endorsed the Pledge of Allegiance, Capital punishment in the United States capital punishment, and Right to keep and bear arms in the United States gun rights, and drew upon his long-standing Christian beliefs to support both school prayer prayer in schools and United States pro-life movement opposed abortion.<ref name="npr"/> The speech at the convention included Bushs famous pledge: "Read my lips: no new taxes."<ref name="bbc">{{cite news publisher=BBC News  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/9/newsid_3655000/3655368.stm title=1988: Bush wins with no new taxes promise accessdate=April 4, 2008   date=November 9, 1988}}</ref>

===Domestic policy===

====Economy====
Early in his term, Bush faced the problem of what to do with leftover United States public debt deficits spawned during the Reagan years. At $220&nbsp;billion in 1990, the deficit had tripled since 1980. Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit, believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so. He began an effort to persuade the 101st United States Congress Democratic controlled Congress to act on the budget; with Republicans believing that the best way was to cut government spending, and Democrats convinced that the only way would be to income tax raise taxes, Bush faced problems when it came to consensus building.<ref name="msn"/>

In the wake of a struggle with Congress, Bush was forced by the Democratic majority to raise tax revenues; as a result, many Republicans felt betrayed because Bush had promised "no new taxes" in his 1988 campaign. Perceiving a means of revenge, Republican congressmen defeated Bushs proposal, which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500&nbsp;billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and gave way to a sharp United States Presidential approval rating decrease in popularity. Bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill.<ref name="msn"/> Near the end of the 101st United States Congress 101st Congress, the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in the capital gains tax, Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be a turning point in the Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.<ref name="ea"/>

Coming at around the same time as the budget deal, America entered into a mild recession, lasting for six months. Many government programs, such as welfare, increased.<ref name="msn"/> As the unemployment rate edged upward in 1991, Bush signed a bill providing additional benefits for unemployed workers.<ref name="ea"/> The year 1991 was marked by many corporate reorganizations, which laid off a substantial number of workers. Many now unemployed were Republicans and independents, who had believed that their jobs were secure.

By his second year in office, Bush was told by his economic advisors to stop dealing with the economy, as they believed that he had done everything necessary to ensure his reelection. By 1992, interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years, but by midyear the unemployment rate reached 7.8%, the highest since 1984. In September 1992, the United States Census Bureau Census Bureau reported that 14.2% of all Americans poverty rate lived in poverty.<ref name="ea"/> At a press conference in 1990, Bush told reporters that he found foreign policy more enjoyable.<ref name="msn"/>

===Points of Light===
{{Main Points of Light}}
President Bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of Americas most serious social problems. He often used the "thousand points of light" theme to describe the power of citizens to solve community problems. In his 1989 inaugural address, President Bush said, "I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good."<ref name="Presidents Report">{{cite book title=The Points of Light Movement: The Presidents Report to the Nation publisher=Executive Office of the President, 1993 url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Points_of_light_movement.html?id=cH8vlwSAjv0C year=1993}}</ref>

Four years later, in his report to the nation on The Points of Light Movement, President Bush said, "Points of Light are the soul of America. They are ordinary people who reach beyond themselves to touch the lives of those in need, bringing hope and opportunity, care and friendship. By giving so generously of themselves, these remarkable individuals show us not only what is best in our heritage but what all of us are called to become."<ref name="Presidents Report" />

===Daily Point of Light Award===
President Bush created the Daily Point of Light Award in 1989 to recognize ordinary Americans from all walks of life taking direct and consequential voluntary action in their communities to solve serious social problems. The President focused great attention on these individuals and organizations, both to honor them for their tremendous work and to call the nation to join them and multiply their efforts. By the end of his administration, President Bush had recognized 1,020 Daily Points of Light representing all 50 states and addressing issues ranging from care for infants and teenagers with AIDS to adult illiteracy and from gang violence to job training for the homeless.<ref name="Presidents Report" /> The Daily Point of Light continues to be awarded by Points of Light and President Bush continues to sign all of the awards.<ref name=Leader-Telegram>{{cite news title=Health Matters 07/10/13 url=http://www.leadertelegram.com/features/health/article_59336b2a-6092-5baa-b8c0-dab07e3ea301.html accessdate=July 11, 2013 newspaper=Leader-Telegram date=July 10, 2013}}</ref>

In the 1980s, Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, a once U.S.-supportive leader who was later accused of spying for Fidel Castro and using Panama to traffic drugs into the United States, was one of the most recognizable names in America and was constantly in the press. The struggle to remove him from power began in the Reagan administration, when economic sanctions were imposed on the country; this included prohibiting American companies and government from making payments to Panama and freezing $56&nbsp;million in Panamanian funds in American banks. Reagan sent more than 2,000 American troops to Panama as well.<ref name="rutgers">{{cite web url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~hbf/panama.htm title=Panama: Background and Buildup to Invasion of 1989 accessdate=April 11, 2008 author=Franklin, Jane year=2001 publisher=Rutgers University}}</ref> Unlike Reagan, Bush was able to remove Noriega from power, but his administrations unsuccessful post-invasion planning hindered the needs of Panama during the establishment of the young democratic government.<ref name="texas">{{cite web title=Prudence in Panama: George H.

In May 1989, Panama held democratic elections, in which Guillermo Endara was elected president; the results were then annulled by Noriegas government. In response, Bush sent 2,000 more troops to the country, where they began conducting regular military exercises in Panamanian territory (in violation of prior treaties). Bush then removed an embassy and United States ambassador ambassador from the country, and dispatched additional troops to Panama to prepare the way for an upcoming invasion.<ref name="rutgers"/> Noriega suppressed an October military coup attempt and massive protests in Panama against him, but after a U.S. serviceman was shot by Panamanian forces in December 1989, Bush ordered 24,000 troops into the country with an objective of removing Noriega from power;<ref name="secdef">{{cite web url=http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/secdef_histories/bios/cheney.htm title=Richard B.

The administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the Soviets, but not all initially found the Malta Summit to be a step in the right direction; General Brent Scowcroft, among others, was apprehensive about the meeting, saying that it might be "premature" due to concerns where, according to Condoleezza Rice, "expectations [would be] set that something was going to happen, where the Soviets might grandstand and force [the U.S.] into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the United States."

The treaty took nine years in the making and was the first major arms agreement since the signing of the INF Treaty Intermediate Ranged Nuclear Forces Treaty by Reagan and Gorbachev in 1987. The contentions in START would reduce the strategic nuclear weapons of the United States and the USSR by about 35% over seven years, and the Soviet Unions land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles would be cut by 50%.

Bush urged that progress be made in improving relations between the U.S. and Japan.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/12/07/Bush-says-US-appreciates-remorse-of-Japan/6434692082000/ title=Bush says U.S. appreciates remorse of Japan publisher=UPI date=December 7, 1991 first=Thomas last=Ferraro}}</ref>

On June 18, 1990, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater confirmed President Bush had sent Prime Minister of Israel Yitzhak Shamir a letter in which he congratulated the latter on his election and urged him to support the proposed "Shamir initiative for peace", which would involve the participation of Palestinian Arabians in local elections.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/06/18/Bush-congratulates-Shamir-pushes-peace-process/4351645681600/ title=Bush congratulates Shamir, pushes peace process publisher=UPI date=June 18, 1990}}</ref> On June 20, Bush suspended American dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization for the latters refusal to condemn the Palestinian guerrilla raid of an Israeli beach the previous month.<ref>{{cite news url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-21/news/mn-118_1_splinter-group title=Bush Suspends Talks With PLO : Terrorism: President assails the organizations failure to denounce a splinter groups raid on an Israeli beach. publisher=Los Angeles Times date=June 21, 1990}}</ref>

===NAFTA===
{{Main North American Free Trade Agreement}}

The Bush administration and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada Progressive Conservative Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney spearheaded the negotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The agreement would eliminate the majority of tariffs on products that were traded among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This would encourage trade among the countries. The treaty also restricted patents, copyrights, and trademarks, and outlined the removal of investment restrictions among the three countries.<ref name="fedex">{{cite web url=http://www.fedex.com/us/customersupport/ftn/faq/nafta.html?link=4  publisher=Federal Express title=Frequently Asked Questions: NAFTA accessdate=April 11, 2008}}</ref> President Bush announced the completion of NAFTA during a Rose Garden appearance on August 12, 1992, calling it the "beginning of a new era".<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/08/12/Bush-announces-new-trade-pact-with-Mexico/2321509303014/ title=Bush announces new trade pact with Mexico first=Helen last=Thomas publisher=UPI date=August 12, 1992}}</ref>

The agreement came under heavy scrutiny amongst mainly Democrats, who charged that NAFTA resulted in a loss of American jobs.<ref name="msn"/> NAFTA also contained no provisions for labor rights; according to the Bush administration, the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable Mexicos government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws. Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks. Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to Congress for a vote, thereby avoiding a situation in which the president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change.<ref name="nafta labor">{{cite web url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/nafta/nafta0401-04.htm publisher=Human Rights Watch accessdate=April 11, 2008 title= The NAFTA Labor Side Accord}}</ref> While initial signing was possible during his term, negotiations made slow, but steady, progress. President Clinton would go on to make the passage of NAFTA a priority for his administration, despite its conservative and Republican roots—with the addition of two side agreements—to achieve its passage in 1993.<ref>{{cite web   url = http://www.law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/nafta.html title=NAFTA publisher=Duke University accessdate=July 30, 2016  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420094150/http://www.law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/nafta.html  archive-date=April 20, 2008}}</ref>

The treaty has since been defended as well as criticized further. The American economy has grown 54% since the adoption of NAFTA in 1993, with 25&nbsp;million new jobs created; this was seen by some as evidence of NAFTA being beneficial to the United States.<ref name="wapo-nafta">{{cite news url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/29/AR2008022902608.html   title= Stop Hating on NAFTA work=The Washington Post author=Gutierrez, Carlos M date= March 1, 2008   accessdate =April 11, 2008}}</ref> With talk in early 2008 regarding a possible American withdrawal from the treaty, Carlos M.

In keeping with tradition, Bush issued a series of pardons during his last days in office.

===1992 presidential campaign===
{{Main United States presidential election, 1992}}
In early 1992, Bush announced that he would seek a second term. A coalition victory in the Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings made re-election seem likely. As a result, many leading Democrats declined to seek their partys presidential nomination. On the negative side, Bushs popularity was reduced by an economic recession and doubts of whether he properly ended the Gulf War.

Conservative political columnist Pat Buchanan challenged Bush for the Republican nomination. He shocked political pundits by finishing second, with 37% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary. Bush responded by adopting more conservative positions on issues, in an attempt to undermine Buchanans base.<ref name="msn"/> Once he had secured the nomination, Bush faced his Democratic challenger, Governor of Arkansas Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. Clinton attacked Bush as a politician who was not doing enough to assist the working middle-class and being "out of touch" with the common man, a notion reinforced by reporter Andrew Rosenthals false report that Bush was "astonished" to see a demonstration of a supermarket barcode reader scanner.<ref name=Goldberg08/><ref name="snopes">{{cite web url=http://www.snopes.com/history/american/bushscan.htm  title=Maybe Im Amazed  date=April 1, 2001  accessdate=April 11, 2008  publisher=Snopes.com  archivedate=May 27, 2012  archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527030747/http://www.snopes.com/history/american/bushscan.asp  deadurl=yes  df=mdy }}</ref><ref name=Rosenthal92/>

Conservative Republicans pointed out that Bushs 1990 agreement to raise taxes contradicted his famous "Read my lips: no new taxes" pledge. In doing so, Bush alienated many members of his conservative base, losing their support for his re-election. According to one survey, of the voters who cited Bushs broken "No New Taxes" pledge as "very important", two thirds voted for Bill Clinton.<ref>{{cite news  first=Jeffrey  last=Schmalz  title=Clinton Carves a Path Deep Into Reagan Country  url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD8173FF937A35752C1A964958260&scp=1&sq=Clinton+Carves+a+Wide+Path+Deep+Into+Reagan+Country&st=nyt  work=The New York Times  date=November 4, 1992  accessdate=May 21, 2008 }}</ref> Bush had raised taxes in an attempt to address an increasing budget deficit, which has largely been attributed to the Reagan tax cuts and military spending of the 1980s.

In 1993, Bush was targeted in an assassination plot when he visited Kuwait to commemorate the coalitions victory over Iraq in the Gulf War. Kuwaiti authorities arrested 17 people who were allegedly involved in using a car bomb to kill Bush. Through interviews with the suspects and examinations of the bombs circuitry and wiring, the FBI established that the plot had been directed by the Iraqi Intelligence Service. A Kuwaiti court later convicted all but one of the defendants. Two months later, Clinton retaliated when he ordered the Cruise missile strikes on Iraq (1993) firing of 23 cruise missiles at Iraqi Intelligence Service headquarters in Baghdad. The day before the strike, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright went before the Security Council to present evidence of the Iraqi plot. After the missiles were fired, Vice President Al Gore said the attack "was intended to be a proportionate response at the place where this plot" to assassinate Bush "was hatched and implemented".<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/longroad/etc/assassination.html  title=frontline: the long road to war: assassination  publisher=PBS  accessdate=September 5, 2010}}</ref>

His eldest son, George W. Bush, was inaugurated as the 43rd president of the United States on January 20, 2001, and re-elected in 2004. Through previous administrations, the elder Bush had ubiquitously been known as "George Bush" or "President Bush", but following his sons election the need to distinguish between them has made retronymic forms such as "George H. W. Bush" and "George Bush senior" and colloquialisms such as "Bush 41" and "Bush the Elder" much more common. H.W. Bush was traveling to Minnesota for a speaking engagement on the day of the September 11 attacks.
