====Coal industry====
On October 6, 2010, Manchin directed a lawsuit aimed at overturning new federal rules concerning mountaintop removal mining. Filed by the state Department of Environmental Protection, the lawsuit "accuses U.S. EPA of overstepping its authority and asks the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia to throw out the federal agencys new guidelines for issuing Clean Water Act permits for coal mines." In order to qualify for the permits, mining companies need to prove their projects would not cause the concentration of pollutants in the local water to rise 5 times past the normal level. The New York Times reported that EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson Lisa Jackson said the new legislation would protect 95 percent of aquatic life by banning operators from dumping mine waste into streams.<ref>{{cite news title=W.Va.

Manchin campaigned in 2010 as being ready to vote for repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, but the next year he voted for Obamacare.<ref>{{cite web last1=Taylor first1=Matt title=Joe Manchin Still Doesnt Like Obamacare url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/06/28/joe_manchin_still_doesn_t_like_obamacare.html website=Slate accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web last1=Schor first1=Elana title=Manchin: Ill help GOP repair Obamacare url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/joe-manchin-obamacare-fixes-233541 website=Politico accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref> On September 27, 2013, Manchin voted to restore funding for Obamacare as part of an amendment to legislation funding government operations for 45 days.

On January 14, 2017, Manchin expressed concern at the strict party-line vote on repealing Obamacare and said he could not, in good conscience, vote to repeal without a new plan in place.

During 2016-17, Manchin read to the Senate several letters from constituents about loved ones deaths from opioids and urged his colleagues to act to prevent more deaths.

====Senior citizens====
To help locate missing senior citizens, Manchin introduced the Silver Alert Act in July 2011 to create a nationwide network for locating missing adults and senior citizens modeled after the AMBER Alert.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.wvmetronews.com/news.cfm?func=displayfullstory&storyid=44122 title=WV MetroNews publisher=Wvmetronews.com accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref> Manchin also sponsored the National Yellow Dot Act to create a voluntary program that would alert emergency services personnel responding to car accidents of the availability of personal and medical information on the cars owner.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.newsandsentinel.com/page/content.detail/id/557859/Bill-unveiled-for-seniors-in-emergency-situations.html?nav=5061 title=Bill unveiled for seniors in emergency situations publisher=Newsand sentinel.com accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref>

Manchin said in 2014 that he "would change Social Security completely. I would do it on an inflationary basis, as far as paying into payroll taxes, and change that, to keep us stabilized as far as cash flow. Id do COLAs—Id talk about Cost of living COLA for 250 percent of poverty guidelines." Asked whether this meant he would "cut benefits to old people," Manchin said that "a rich old person...wont get the COLAs." He asked: "Do you want United States Chained Consumer Price Index chained CPI? I can live with either one."<ref>{{cite web last1=Weigel first1=David title=Joe Manchin, Grover Norquist, and the Economic Consensus of #ThisTown url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/03/18/joe_manchin_grover_norquist_and_the_economic_consensus_of_thistown.html website=Slate accessdate=March 26, 2018}}</ref>

====LGBT rights====
On December 9, 2010, Manchin was the sole Democrat to vote against cloture for the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act, which contained a provision to repeal Dont ask, dont tell Dont Ask, Dont Tell.

====China====
In July 2017, he urged Trump to block the sale of the Chicago Stock Exchange to Chinese investors, arguing that Chinas "rejection of fundamental free-market norms and property rights of private citizens makes me strongly doubt whether an Exchange operating under the direct control of a Chinese entity can be trusted to self-regulate now and in the future." He also expressed concern "that the challenges plaguing the Chinese market – lack of transparency, currency manipulation, etc. – will bleed into the Chicago Stock Exchange and adversely impact financial markets across the country."<ref>{{cite web last1=Louis first1=Brian title=Two Chinese bidders for Chicago Exchange are said to drop out url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-chicago-stock-exchange-chinese-bidders-drop-out-20171016-story.html website=Chicago Tribune accessdate=March 28, 2018}}</ref>

Manchin was the first Democrat to say he would vote for President Trumps nominee for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch. Manchin said, "During his time on the bench, Judge Gorsuch has received praise from his colleagues who have been appointed by both Democrats and Republicans. He has been consistently rated as a well-qualified jurist, the highest rating a jurist can receive, and I have found him to be an honest and thoughtful man."<ref>{{Cite news url=https://wvrecord.com/stories/511099958-law-courts-manchin-becomes-first-democrat-to-say-he-ll-vote-for-gorsuch title=Manchin becomes first Democrat to say hell vote for Gorsuch last=Dickerson first=Chris date=March 30, 2017 work=West Virginia Record access-date=December 1, 2017 language=en}}</ref> He was also the first Democrat to announce that he would meet with Trumps second Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.<ref>{{Cite news url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/25/supreme-court-pick-shakes-up-west-virginia-senate-race.html title=Supreme Court pick shakes up West Virginia Senate race last=Doocy first=Peter date=2018-07-25 work=Fox News access-date=2018-07-25 language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2006 and 2010 Manchin delivered commencement addresses at Wheeling Jesuit University and at Davis & Elkins College, receiving honorary degrees from both institutions.

In December 2012, Manchin voiced his displeasure with MTVs new reality show Buckwild (TV series) Buckwild, set in his home states capital Charleston, and asked the networks president to cancel the show, which, he argued, depicted West Virginia in a negative, unrealistic fashion.<ref>{{Cite news url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/wp/2012/12/07/joe-manchin-objects-to-mtvs-buckwild-reality-show/ title = Joe Manchin objects to MTVs Buckwild reality show last = OKeefe first = Ed date = December 7, 2012 work = Washington Post access-date = }}</ref> The show ended after its first season.<ref>{{Citation last=Amin first=Salwa title=Buckwild date=January 3, 2013 url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2555880/ last2=Boulet last3=Bradley last4=Davis first2=Tyler first3=Shae first4=Anna accessdate=January 29, 2017}}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Heather Bresch===
West Virginia University (WVU) awarded Manchins daughter, Heather Bresch, an MBA in 2007, the year she became Chief Operations Officer COO at Mylan Inc., the third largest generic pharmaceutical manufacturer in the U.S. with headquarters in Morgantown, adjacent to the WVU campus. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that in order to justify this degree, university officials had added courses to her transcript that she had never taken and altered grades she had received. The ensuing controversy resulted in the rescinding of her MBA and the resignation of the university president, Mike Garrison, a Manchin family friend, and Garrisons legal counsel and the Dean of the Business School. A panel was convened to fully investigate the measure.<ref name="huntingtonnews.net">{{cite web title=Joe Manchin III: The Harry Houdini of West Virginia Politics url=http://www.huntingtonnews.net/8650 publisher=Huntington News accessdate=April 26, 2012 author= date=September 1, 2011}}</ref> When the MBA controversy erupted, according to The Huntington News, Manchin "act[ed] as though he and his wife, Gayle, were somehow the victims of this hoax that almost cost WVU its academic credibility." According to the Huntington News, "the Manchins were seen as people willing to destroy [the universitys] reputation rather than admit a mistake."<ref>{{cite news   url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/opinion/editorials/message-for-wvu-the-board-of-governors-must-restore-credibility-394283   title=Message for WVU: The board of governors must restore credibility   publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette   work=post-gazette.com   date=May 16, 2008   accessdate=April 26, 2012   author=Staff}}</ref>

Noting in a December 2011 editorial that the magazine Esquire had promoted Heather Bresch as an "American hero" owing to her support for a pharma safety law, the Huntington News pointed out that the law also protected U.S. pharma firms like Mylan and suggested that the article was a "public makeover" engineered by "the Manchin public relations machine." It also said that Mylan "must have the only corporate Board of Directors in the country that doesnt care about one of their top execs being proven to have a phony MBA degree."<ref>{{cite web title=EDITORIAL: The Manchin PR Machine Keeps Rollin. But Who Buys It? url=http://www.huntingtonnews.net/8650 website=Huntington News accessdate=March 25, 2018}}</ref>

Despite Manchins call for a war on drugs, particularly opioids, and his charge that "Big Pharma" had "targeted" his state, Manchins daughter, as noted, is the CEO of Mylan, a pharmaceutical firm that produces opioids, and Manchin himself accepted "nearly $180,000 in donations from pharmaceutical companies between 2011 and 2016."<ref>{{cite web last1=Siegel first1=Zachary title=West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin: We Need To Declare A War on Drugs url=https://www.thefix.com/west-virginia-senator-joe-manchin-we-need-declare-war-drugs website=the fix accessdate=March 28, 2018}}</ref> In August 2016, Fortune Magazine and the Washington Post ran a total of three articles about the fact that the "CEO of the company at the center of the EpiPen controversy" was Manchins daughter. The articles noted that skyrocketing EpiPen costs were "the next big flash point in the national debate over skyrocketing prescription drug prices," that Bresch had originally gotten her Mylan job through her father, and that her career had "risen along with her fathers, a fact that has not gone unnoticed by her critics." A particular point of controversy was the fact that Bresch had transferred Mylans official headquarters to the Netherlands, a tax dodge maneuver known as tax inversion.<ref>{{cite web last1=WIECZNER first1=Jen title=The Truth About Mylan CEOs Heather Bresch Situation and Her MBA url=http://fortune.com/2016/08/26/epipen-mylan-ceo-interview-heather-bresch-mba/ website=Fortune accessdate=March 28, 2018}}</ref>

===Manchins coal interests===
In July 2011, the New York Times ran a long article headlined "Sen. Manchin Maintains Lucrative Ties to Family-Owned Coal Company." Manchins 2009 and 2010 financial disclosures included major earnings from Enersystems Inc., "a coal brokerage that he helped run before his political star rose." Many senators earn business income, but Manchin is rare in that "he derives income from an industry while acting as one of its biggest boosters."<ref>{{cite web last1=QUINONES first1=MANUEL last2=SCHOR first2=ELANA title=Sen.

===Skipping votes and convention===
On December 18, 2010, Manchin skipped the vote to repeal Dont Ask, Dont Tell and the vote on the DREAM Act, regarding immigration. The National Republican Senatorial Committee criticized Manchin for attending a family Christmas gathering instead of voting on these important issues. "For a Senator who has only been on the job a few weeks," commented the NRSC, "Manchins absence today, and the apparent lack of seriousness with which he takes the job he was elected to do, speaks volumes."<ref name="Skip votes">{{cite news  title=Joe Manchin Skipped DREAM And DADT Votes For A Christmas Party date=December 18, 2010  publisher=Talking Points Memo  url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/12/joe-manchin-skipped-dream-and-dadt-votes-for-a-christmas-party.php?ref=fpi}}</ref> The Washington Post reported that he was the only Senate Democrat to miss these votes "on two of his partys signature pieces of legislation."<ref>{{cite news title=Joe Manchin absent for two major Senate votes url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/12/joe-manchin-absent-for-dream-a.html publisher=The Washington Post accessdate=May 4, 2012 author=Felicia Sonmez date=December 18, 2010}}</ref> Later, in 2012, Manchin also skipped the Democratic National Convention, saying he planned "to spend this fall focused on the people of West Virginia."<ref>{{cite web last1=Hamby first1=Peter last2=Killough first2=Ashley title=Manchin to skip Democratic National Convention url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/18/manchin-to-skip-democratic-national-convention/ website=political ticker - CNN accessdate=March 28, 2018}}</ref>
