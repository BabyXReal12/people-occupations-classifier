In 1973, Bloomberg became a general partner at Salomon Brothers, a bulge-bracket Wall Street investment bank, where he headed equity trading and, later, systems development. In 1981, Salomon Brothers was bought<ref>Bloomberg, Michael (1997). Bloomberg by Bloomberg, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Using this money, Bloomberg went on to set up a company named Innovative Market Systems. His business plan was based on the realization that Wall Street (and the financial community generally) was willing to pay for high-quality business information, delivered as quickly as possible and in as many usable forms possible, via technology (e.g., graphs of highly specific trends).<ref>Richard S.

Bloomberg assumed office as the 108th Mayor of New York City on January 1, 2002. He won re-election in 2005 and again in 2009. As mayor, Bloomberg initially struggled to gain high approval levels from the public; however, he subsequently developed and maintained high approval ratings.<ref>Joyce Purnick, Mike Bloomberg: Money, Power, Politics (2009)</ref> His re-election meant the Republicans had won the previous four mayoral elections (although Bloombergs decision to leave the Republican Party and be declared an independent on June 19, 2007, resulted in the Republican Party (United States) Republican Partys losing the mayors seat prior to the expiration of his second term). Bloomberg joined Rudy Giuliani and Fiorello La Guardia as re-elected Republican mayors in the mostly Democratic city. (John Lindsay was also elected mayor of New York City twice while a registered Republican; however, Lindsay did not receive the Republican Party nomination during his New York City mayoral elections#1969 1969 campaign for re-election but ran successfully on the Liberal Party of New York Liberal ticket and joined the Democratic Party (United States) Democratic Party during his second term.){{citation needed date=October 2016}}

Bloomberg stated that he wanted public education reform to be the legacy of his first term and addressing poverty to be the legacy of his second.<ref>[http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/finance/20060907/8/1964 "The Mayors Legacy"], Gotham Gazette, September 2006.</ref> According to the National Assessment of Educational Performance, fourth-grade reading scores from 2002-09 rose nationally by 11 points. However, on May 10, 2010, The New York Times reported:

<blockquote>According to the test [NAEP], New York City eighth graders have shown no significant improvement [in math or reading] since they began taking it in 2003, mirroring the largely flat performance of American eighth graders as a whole during that period. In the city, the lack of improvement held true across ethnic groups and also among lower-income students.</blockquote>

Some activists (including Diane Ravitch) opposed Bloombergs reforms, claiming his approach to the New York City education system was largely unsuccessful because of skewed numbers. Under the reformed approach, a school had to have done better than the previous year to receive funding. Due to this requirement, it was alleged that many successful schools were closed for being "unsuccessful" based on their inability to raise test scores, even though they were top performing schools, while many unsuccessful schools received the bulk of funding for simply raising their scores slightly.<ref>{{cite book last=Ravich first=Diane title=The Death and Life of The Great American School System: How Testing and Choice are Undermining Education publisher=Basic Books year=2010 isbn=978-0-465-01491-0}}</ref>

Bloomberg chose to apply a statistical, results-based approach to city management, appointing city commissioners based on their expertise and granting them wide autonomy in their decision-making. Breaking with 190 years of tradition, he implemented what New York Times political reporter Adam Nagourney called a "bullpen" open office plan, similar to a Wall Street trading floor, in which dozens of aides and managerial staff are seated together in a large chamber. The design is intended to promote accountability and accessibility.<ref>Nagourney, Adam (December 25, 2001).

In efforts to create "cutbacks" in the New York City Spending Bracket, Bloomberg declined to receive a city salary. He accepted a One-dollar salary remuneration of $1 annually for his services.<ref>Biographiq (March 2008).

Bloomberg stated that during his mayoralty, he rode the New York City Subway on a daily basis, particularly in the commute from his 79th Street home to his office at New York City Hall City Hall. An August 2007 story in The New York Times stated that he was often seen chauffeured by two New York Police Department-owned SUVs to an express train station to avoid having to change from the local to the express trains on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.<ref>Michael M.

===Elections===
====2001 election====
{{Main New York City mayoral election, 2001}}
In 2001, the incumbent mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, was ineligible for re-election, as the city limited the mayoralty to two consecutive terms. Several well-known New York City politicians aspired to succeed him. Bloomberg, a lifelong member of the Democratic Party (United States) Democratic Party, decided to run for mayor as a member of the Republican Party (United States) Republican Party ticket. Voting in the primary began on the morning of September 11, 2001. The primary was postponed later that day, due to the September 11 attacks. In the rescheduled primary, Bloomberg defeated Herman Badillo, a former United States House of Representatives Congressman, to become the Republican nominee. Meanwhile, the Democratic primary did not produce a first-round winner. After a Two-round system runoff, the Democratic nomination went to New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green.

In the general election, Bloomberg received Giulianis endorsement. He also had a huge spending advantage. Although New York Citys Campaign finance in the United States campaign finance law restricts the amount of contributions which a candidate can accept, Bloomberg chose not to use public campaign funds and therefore his campaign was not subject to these restrictions. He spent $73 million of his own money on his campaign, outspending Green five to one.<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ideas_opinions/story/143966p-127415c.html  title=Mikes Wrong, Campaign Fixes Make Sense  work=Daily News (New York) Daily News location=New York author=Gene Russianoff Russianoff, Gene date=December 9, 2003 archivedate=January 5, 2006  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105025803/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ideas_opinions/story/143966p-127415c.html}}</ref> One of the major themes of his campaign was that, with the citys economy suffering from the effects of the World Trade Center attacks, it needed a mayor with business experience.

In addition to serving as the Republican nominee, Bloomberg had the ballot line of the controversial Independence Party of New York Independence Party, in which "Social Therapy" leaders Fred Newman (philosopher) Fred Newman and Lenora Fulani exert strong influence. Some{{Who date=January 2018}} say that endorsement was important, as Bloombergs votes on that line exceeded his margin of victory over Green. (Under New Yorks Electoral fusion fusion rules, a candidate can run on more than one partys line and combine all the votes received on all lines. Green, the Democrat, had the ballot line of the Working Families Party. He also created an independent line called Students First whose votes were combined with those on the Independence line). Another factor was the vote in Staten Island, which has traditionally been far friendlier to Republicans than the rest of the city. Bloomberg handily beat Green in that borough, taking 75 percent of the vote there. Overall, Election results for mayor of New York Bloomberg won 50 percent to 48 percent.{{citation needed date=October 2016}}

Bloombergs election marked the first time in New York City history that two different Republicans had been elected mayor consecutively. New York City has not been won by a Republican in a presidential election since Calvin Coolidge won in United States presidential election, 1924 1924. Bloomberg is considered a social Modern liberalism in the United States liberal, who is pro-choice, in favor of legalization legalizing same-sex marriage and an advocate for stricter gun control laws. Although 68 percent of New York Citys registered voters are Democrats, Bloomberg decided the city should host the 2004 Republican National Convention. The convention drew thousands of protesters, many of them local residents angry over the Iraq war and other issues. The New York Police Department arrested approximately 1,800 protesters, but according to The New York Times, more than 90 percent of the cases were later dismissed or dropped for lack of evidence.{{citation needed date=October 2016}}

Regarding border security, he compared it to the tide, stating, "Its as if we expect border control agents to do what a century of communism could not: defeat the natural market forces of supply and demand... and defeat the natural human desire for freedom and opportunity. You might as well as sit in your beach chair and tell the tide not to come in.

====Health regulations====
In January 2011, city schools began a pilot program which allows girls over 14 years old to be provided with Plan B emergency contraception without parental consent, unless parents opt out in writing.

In September 2012, the city passed a law limiting the practice of circumcision among Orthodox Jews. The legislation requires that at each event, the mohel receives signed consent forms from the parents, acknowledging that they were notified of health risks associated with cleaning the wound by sucking blood from the male babys organ.

During the same month, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene NYC Board of Health approved Bloombergs New York City soft drink size limit proposal to ban the sale of many sweetened drinks more than 16 ounces (473&nbsp;ml) in volume. The limit would have applied to businesses such as restaurants and movie theaters, but did not apply to grocery stores, including 7-Eleven.

On March 12, 2013, hours before the ban was scheduled to take effect, New York Supreme Court State Supreme Court Justice Milton Tingling struck it down, ruling that the Board of Health lacked the jurisdiction to enforce it and that the rule was "arbitrary and capricious".

Criticism of Bloombergs attempt to ban the sale of large soft drinks was picked up, mostly by United States Republican Party Republican and libertarianism libertarian commentators and politicians, as a line of attack in political campaigns around the United States. In one example, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul brought Big Gulps to a joint appearance for Cuccinellis ultimately unsuccessful Virginia gubernatorial election, 2013 2013 gubernatorial campaign to symbolize Bloombergs efforts to restrict soft drink sales, criticizing the mayor for wanting "to buy the governors office down here", a reference to pro-gun control advertisements his political action committee was running in the state.<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/31/ken-cuccinelli-s-libertarian-love-affair.html work=The Daily Beast title=Ken Cuccinellis Libertarian Love Affair date=October 31, 2013 accessdate=November 8, 2013}}</ref> Republican legislators in Wisconsin reacted to the ban by inserting language to prohibit communities from restricting the sale of large soft drinks throughout the state in a 2013 budget bill.<ref>{{cite news url=http://news.wpr.org/post/gop-lawmakers-want-prohibit-restrictions-big-gulp-sodas publisher=Wisconsin Public Radio title=GOP Lawmakers Want To Prohibit Restrictions on Big Gulp Sodas date=May 9, 2013 accessdate=November 8, 2013}}</ref>

====Response to 9/11====
Bloomberg believes that the September 11, 2001 attacks were not intended to be solitary events. When he assumed office, he set up a Counterterrorism Bureau which works along with the NYPD intelligence division to gather information about terrorism affecting New York City worldwide.<ref>{{cite book  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-YoDS2xu1aQC&pg=PT23&dq=michael+bloomberg+counterterrorism+bureau&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hAviT-2XGfS00AHfy9jUAw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=michael%20bloomberg%20counterterrorism%20bureau&f=false title=A Decade of Hope: Stories of Grief and Endurance from 9/11 Families and Friends – Dennis Smith – Google Books publisher=Books.google.com accessdate=November 5, 2012}}</ref> He believes that funding for Homeland Security by the federal government should be distributed by risk, where cities that are considered to have the highest threat for a terrorist attack would get the most money.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://hsgac.senate.gov/_files/010907Bloomberg.pdf  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110071504/http://hsgac.senate.gov/_files/010907Bloomberg.pdf  archivedate=January 10, 2007  title=Michael Bloomberg addresses the Senate  accessdate=August 2, 2007  publisher=U.S. Senate}}</ref> Bloomberg is also a supporter of the USA PATRIOT Act.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Mike_Bloomberg_VoteMatch.htm  title=Mike Bloomberg on the Issues  accessdate=August 2, 2007  work=On The Issues}}</ref>

After the April 15, 2013, Boston Marathon bombings, Bloomberg expressed the view that terrorism threats may require a reconsideration of civil liberties, saying "the people who are worried about privacy have a legitimate worry, but we live in a complex world where youre going to have to have a level of security greater than you did back in the olden days, if you will&nbsp;... our laws and our interpretation of the Constitution, I think, have to change."<ref>[http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/04/23/mayor-bloomberg-interpretation-of-u-s-constitution-will-have-to-change-following-boston-bombings/ "Mayor Bloomberg: Interpretation of U.S. Constitution Will Have to Change Following Boston Bombings"].

====Economic issues====
Bloomberg characterizes himself as a fiscal conservative for turning the citys $6-billion deficit into a $3-billion surplus; however, conservative PAC Club for Growth has criticized him because he increased property taxes and spending while doing so.

{{Quote Being a fiscal conservative is not about slashing programs that help the poor, or improve health care, or ensure a social safety net. Its about insisting services are provided efficiently, get to only the people that need them, and achieve the desired results. Fiscal conservatives have hearts too&nbsp;– but we also insist on using our brains, and that means demanding results and holding government accountable for producing them.

To me, fiscal conservatism means balancing budgets&nbsp;– not running deficits that the next generation cant afford. It means improving the efficiency of delivering services by finding innovative ways to do more with less. It means cutting taxes when possible and prudent to do so, raising them overall only when necessary to balance the budget, and only in combination with spending cuts. It means when you run a surplus, you save it; you dont squander it. And most importantly, being a fiscal conservative means preparing for the inevitable economic downturns&nbsp;– and by all indications, weve got one coming. Michael Bloomberg speech to UK Conservative Party, September 30, 2007<ref name=ukspeech/>}}

Bloomberg has expressed a distaste of taxes, stating, "Taxes are not good things, but if you want services, somebodys got to pay for them, so theyre a necessary evil."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.woopidoo.com/business_quotes/authors/michael-bloomberg-quotes.htm  title=Michael Bloomberg Quotes accessdate=August 2, 2007 publisher=woopidoo.com}}</ref> As mayor, he did raise property taxes to fund budget projects; however, in January 2007, he proposed cuts in property taxes by five percent and cuts in sales taxes, including the elimination of taxes on clothing and footwear. Bloomberg pointed to the Wall Street profits and the real estate market as evidence that the citys economy is booming and could handle a tax break.<ref>{{Cite news url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30914FF3A540C748DDDA80894DF404482&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fP%2fProperty%20Taxes title=Mayor Plans Cut in Property Tax And End to Sales Tax on Clothes work=The New York Times first=Diane last=Cardwell date=January 17, 2007 accessdate=August 2, 2007}}</ref>

Bloombergs self-described fiscal conservatism also led him to eliminate the existing $6-billion deficit when he assumed office.

Bloomberg is in favor of providing tax breaks to big corporations for the good of the whole community. As mayor, Bloomberg lobbied the CEO of Goldman Sachs to establish its headquarters across from Ground Zero#World Trade Center Ground Zero by promising $1.65 billion in tax breaks. Regarding this deal, Bloomberg stated, "This [New York City] is where the best want to live and work. So I told him [CEO of Goldman Sachs], We can help with minimizing taxes. Minimizing your rent.

Bloomberg had less cordial relations with unions as mayor. In 2002, when New York Citys transit workers threatened to strike, Bloomberg responded by riding a mountain bike through the city to show how the city could deal with the transit strike by finding alternate means of transportation and not pandering to the unions.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.transalt.org/press/askta/021216.html  title=Bikes, Mike and Transit Strike  accessdate=August 2, 2007  publisher=transalt.org  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000156/http://www.transalt.org/press/askta/021216.html  archivedate=September 27, 2007  df= }}</ref> Three years later, a clash over wages and union benefits led to a three-day strike.

Bloomberg is a staunch advocate of free trade and is strongly opposed to protectionism, stating, "The things that we have to worry about is this protectionist movement that has reared its head again in this country...." He worries about the growth of China and fears the lessening gap between the United States and other countries: "The rest of the world is catching up, and, there are people that say, surpassing us.

====Preservation and development issues====

Bloomberg is a proponent of large-scale Urban development development.

In January 2008, the Associated Press reported that Bloomberg met with Clay Mulford, a ballot-access expert and campaign manager for Ross Perots third-party presidential campaigns. Bloomberg denied that the meeting concerned a possible presidential campaign, and said the following month, "I am not – and will not be – a candidate for president." He added that he is "hopeful that the current campaigns can rise to the challenge by offering truly independent leadership. The most productive role that I can serve is to push them forward, by using the means at my disposal to promote a real and honest debate.<ref name=notrunning/>

At the same time that the presidential run was being considered, there was also some speculation that Bloomberg could be a candidate for the vice presidency in 2008. In a blog posting of June 21, 2007, Ben Smith (journalist) Ben Smith of The Politico asked the question of whether a vice-presidential candidate can self-finance an entire presidential ticket.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0607/Mike_for_Veep.html title=Mike for Veep? work=Politico (newspaper) Politico author=Smith, Ben date=June 21, 2007}}</ref>

====Rumored gubernatorial campaign====
In November 2007, the New York Post detailed efforts by New York State Republicans to recruit Bloomberg to oppose Governor Eliot Spitzer in the New York gubernatorial election, 2010 2010 election. Early polls indicated Bloomberg would defeat Spitzer in a landslide.
