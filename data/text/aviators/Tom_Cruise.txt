Cruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist Edward Jay Epstein as "one of the most powerful – and richest – forces in Hollywood."

====Management of United Artists====
In November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio United Artists.<ref name="MGM"/> Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UAs chief executive.

Production began in 2007 of Valkyrie (film) Valkyrie, a thriller based on the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007 Cruise signed on to play Claus von Stauffenberg, the protagonist. This project marked the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, Lions for Lambs, directed by Robert Redford and starring Redford, Meryl Streep and Cruise. Lambs was released on November 9, 2007,<ref>{{cite web url=http://newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/3/21/73153.shtml?s=en  archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712180209/http://newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/3/21/73153.shtml?s=en  dead-url=yes  archive-date=July 12, 2012  title=Tom Cruise Takes on Adolf Hitler  website=Newsmax.com  date=March 21, 2007  accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref> opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception.

==="Tom Cruise Picture"===
While reviewing Days of Thunder, film critic Roger Ebert noted the similarities between several of Cruises 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the Tom Cruise Picture. Some of Cruises later films like A Few Good Men and The Last Samurai can also be considered to be part of this formula.

Widescreenings noted that for Tom Cruises character Daniel Kaffee in A Few Good Men, "[screenwriter] Aaron Sorkin interestingly takes the opposite approach of Top Gun, where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In Top Gun, Cruise plays Mitchell who is a hot shot military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do." Sorkin and director Rob Reiner are praised in gradually unveiling Kaffees potential in the film.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.widescreenings.com/few-good-men-analysis-review.html title=Review and analysis: A Few Good Men first=Inspired by R.

==Litigation==
During Cruises marriage to Nicole Kidman, the couple endured a great deal of public speculation about their sex life and rumors that Cruise was gay. In 1998, he successfully sued the Daily Express, a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a sham marriage sham designed to cover up his homosexuality.<ref>{{cite news url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/203779.stm  title=Cruise and Kidman win libel case  publisher=BBC News  date=October 29, 1998  accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref>

In May 2001, he filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had allegedly told the celebrity magazine Actustar that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise,<ref>{{cite news last=Davis first=Simon title=Cruise sues porn star over gay love claims url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1329163/Cruise-sues-porn-star-over-gay-love-claims.html accessdate=May 6, 2013 newspaper=The Daily Telegraph date=May 4, 2001 location=London}}</ref> and in August 2001, Slater was ordered to pay $10&nbsp;million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/2664159.stm  title=Cruise wins gay claims legal battle  publisher=BBC News  date=January 16, 2003  accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref>

Cruise also sued Bold Magazine publisher Michael Davis, who alleged but never confirmed that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.<ref>{{cite news url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/1686039.stm  title=Cruise gay claims dropped  publisher=BBC News  date=December 1, 2001  accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref>

In 2006, Cruise sued cybersquatting cybersquatter Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar, the domain redirected to information about Cruise on Celebrity1000.com. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise was handed down by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on July 5, 2006.<ref>{{cite web author=Arbitration and Mediation Center  url=http://arbiter.wipo.int/domains/decisions/html/2006/d2006-0560.html  title=WIPO Domain Name Decision: D2006-0560  website=Arbiter.wipo.int  date=July 5, 2006  accessdate=August 8, 2009}}</ref>

In 2009, Michael Davis Sapir filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruises behest. That suit was dropped due to statute of limitations.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.celebuzz.com/2012-07-06/tom-cruise-accused-of-wiretap-conspiracy-with-convicted-criminal-anthony-pellicano-during-nicole-kidman-divorce-exclusive/ title=Tom Cruise Accused of Wiretap Conspiracy With Convicted Criminal Anthony Pellicano During Nicole Kidman Divorce work=Celebuzz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/tom-cruise-bert-fields-win-dismissal-wiretapping-suit-81691/ title=Tom Cruise, Bert Fields Win Dismissal of Pellicano Wiretapping Suit work=TheWrap}}</ref>

In October 2012, Cruise filed a lawsuit against In Touch Weekly In Touch and Life & Style (magazine) Life & Style for defamation after the magazines claimed Cruise had "abandoned" his six-year-old daughter.<ref>{{cite news   url=http://www.tmz.com/2012/10/24/tom-cruise-50-million-dollar-lawsuit-life-and-style-abandoned-suri/   title=Tom Cruise Files $50 Mil Lawsuit Over Mag Claiming He Abandoned Suri    date=October 24, 2012  work=TMZ   accessdate=October 24, 2012}}</ref>  During deposition, Cruise acknowledged that 110 days had passed without him seeing her.
