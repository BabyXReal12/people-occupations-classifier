<strong>Charles Augustus Lindbergh</strong> (February 4, 1902 – August 26, 1974), nicknamed Lucky Lindy, The Lone Eagle, and Slim<ref>Every and Tracy 1927, pp. 60, 84, 91, 208.</ref> was an American aviator, military officer, author, inventor, explorer, and environmental activist. At age 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a U.S. Air Mail pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the Orteig Prize: making a nonstop flight from Roosevelt Field (airport) Roosevelt Field, Long Island, New York (state) New York, to Paris, France. Lindbergh covered the {{frac 33 1 2}}-hour, {{convert 3,600 smi km}} alone in a single-engine purpose-built Ryan monoplane, Spirit of St. Louis. This was not the Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown first flight between North America and Europe, but he did achieve the first solo transatlantic flight and the first non-stop flight between North America and the European mainland. Lindbergh was an officer in the United States Army Reserve U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve, and he received the United States highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, for the feat.{{sfn  Bryson  2013  pp=25–104}}

His achievement spurred interest in both commercial aviation and air mail, and Lindbergh himself devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. Lindberghs historic flight and celebrity status led to tragedy. In March 1932, his infant son, Charles Jr., Lindbergh kidnapping was kidnapped and murdered in what American media called the "Crime of the Century" and described by H. L. Mencken H.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Mencken as "the biggest story since the Resurrection of Jesus Resurrection".<ref>Newton 2012, [http://www.mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6620-7 p. 197] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204202216/http://www.mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6620-7  date=February 4, 2017 }}.</ref> The case prompted the United States Congress to establish Federal Kidnapping Act kidnapping as a federal crime once the kidnapper had crossed state lines with their victim. By late 1935 the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into voluntary exile in Europe, from which they returned in 1939.

Before the United States formally entered World War II, some people accused Lindbergh of being a fascism fascist sympathizer. An advocate of non-interventionism<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.charleslindbergh.com/americanfirst/ title=Charles Lindberghs Noninterventionist Efforts & America First Committee website=www.charleslindbergh.com}}</ref> he supported the antiwar America First Committee, which opposed American aid to Britain in its war against Germany, and resigned his commission in the United States Army Air Forces in 1941 after President Franklin Roosevelt publicly rebuked him for his views. Nevertheless, he publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and flew fifty combat missions in the Pacific War Pacific Theater of World War II as a civilian consultant{{Citation needed date=June 2018}}, though Roosevelt refused to reinstate his Air Corps colonels commission.
In his later years, Lindbergh became a prolific prize-winning author, international explorer, inventor, and environmentalist.

Lindbergh and his wife, the former Anne Morrow, were the parents of six children. In 2003—twenty-nine years after Lindberghs death and two years after his wife died—it was revealed that beginning in 1957 (when he was 55 years old), Lindbergh had engaged in several covert adulterous affairs with three European women, with whom he fathered seven more children, none of whom learned of their  fathers true identity until a decade after his 1974 death.

===Early childhood===
File:Charles&Dad.jpg thumb right upright=0.75 Charles A. Lindbergh and his father, circa 1910

Lindbergh was born in Detroit, Michigan, on {{nowrap February 4}}, 1902, and spent most of his childhood in Little Falls, Minnesota, and Washington, D.C. He was the third child of Charles August Lindbergh (Name at birth birth name Carl Månsson; 1859–1924) who had emigrated from Sweden to Melrose, Minnesota as an infant, and his only child with his second wife, Evangeline Lodge Land Lindbergh (1876–1954), of Detroit. Charles parents separated in 1909 when he was seven.<ref>Larson 1973, pp. 31–32.</ref> Lindberghs father, a United States Congress U.S. Congressman (Republican Party (United States) R-Minnesota MN-6) from 1907 to 1917, was one of the few Congressmen to oppose the entry of the U.S. into World War I (although his Congressional term ended one month prior to the House of Representatives voting to declare war on Germany).<ref>Larson 1973, pp. 208–209.</ref>

Lindberghs mother was a chemistry teacher at Cass Technical High School in Detroit and later at Little Falls High School, from which her son graduated on {{nowrap June 5}}, 1918. Lindbergh also attended over a dozen other schools from Washington, D.C., to California, during his childhood and teenage years (none for more than a year or two), including the Force School and Sidwell Friends School while living in Washington with his father, and Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California, while living there with his mother.<ref>Lindbergh 1927, pp. 19–22.</ref> Although he enrolled in the College of Engineering at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in late 1920, Lindbergh dropped out in the middle of his sophomore year and then went to Lincoln, Nebraska, in March 1922 to begin flight training.<ref>Lindbergh 1927, pp.&nbsp;22–25.</ref>

From an early age, Lindbergh had exhibited an interest in the mechanics of motorized transportation, including his familys Saxon (automobile) Saxon Six automobile, and later his Excelsior Motor Manufacturing & Supply Company Excelsior motorbike. By the time he started college as a mechanical engineering student, he had also become fascinated with flying, though he "had never been close enough to a plane to touch it".<ref>Lindbergh 1927, p. 23.</ref> After quitting college in February 1922, Lindbergh enrolled at the Nebraska Aircraft Corporations flying school in Lincoln and flew for the first time on {{nowrap April 9}}, as a passenger in a two-seat Standard J Lincoln Standard "Tourabout" biplane trainer piloted by Otto Timm.<ref>Lindbergh 1927, p. 25.</ref>

A few days later, Lindbergh took his first formal flying lesson in that same machine, though he was never permitted to solo because he could not afford to post the requisite damage bond.<ref>Lindbergh 1927, pp. 26–28.</ref> To gain flight experience and earn money for further instruction, Lindbergh left Lincoln in June to spend the next few months barnstorming across Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana as a wing walking wing walker and Parachuting parachutist. He also briefly worked as an airplane mechanic at the Billings, Montana, municipal airport.<ref>Lindbergh 1927, pp. 29–36.</ref><ref>Westover, Lee Ann.

Lindbergh left flying with the onset of winter and returned to his fathers home in Minnesota.<ref>Lindbergh 1927, pp. 36–37.</ref> His return to the air and first solo flight did not come until half a year later in May 1923 at Jimmy Carter Regional Airport Souther Field in Americus, Georgia, a former Army flight training field, where he had come to buy a World War I surplus Curtiss JN-4 Curtiss JN-4 "Jenny" biplane. Though Lindbergh had not touched an airplane in more than six months, he had already secretly decided he was ready to take to the air by himself. After a half-hour of dual time with a pilot who was visiting the field to pick up another surplus JN-4, Lindbergh flew solo for the first time in the Jenny he had just purchased for $500.<ref>Lindbergh 1927, pp. 39–43.</ref><ref>[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/plane/firstplane.asp "Charles Lindberghs First Solo Flight & First Plane"].

While Lindbergh was barnstorming in Lone Rock, Wisconsin, on two occasions he flew a local physician across the Wisconsin River to emergency calls that were otherwise unreachable due to flooding.<ref>Smith, Susan Lampert "Dr. Bertha Stories: Dr. Berthas Decades in the River Valley Included remarkable Medical Feats". Wisconsin State Journal, April 20, 2003.</ref> He broke his propeller several times while landing, and on {{nowrap June 3}}, 1923 he was grounded for a week when he ran into a ditch in Glencoe, Minnesota while flying his father—then running for the U.S. Senate—to a campaign stop. In October, Lindbergh flew his Jenny to Iowa, where he sold it to a flying student. After selling the Jenny, Lindbergh returned to Lincoln by train. There, he joined Leon Klink and continued to barnstorm through the South for the next few months in Klinks Curtiss JN-4C "Canuck" (the Canadian version of the Jenny). Lindbergh also "cracked up" this aircraft once when his engine failed shortly after take-off in Pensacola, Florida, but again he managed to repair the damage himself.<ref>Lindbergh 1927, pp. 84–93.</ref>

Following a few months of barnstorming through the South, the two pilots parted company in San Antonio, Texas, where Lindbergh reported to Brooks City-Base Brooks Field on {{nowrap March 19}}, 1924, to begin a year of military flight training with the United States Army Air Service there (and later at nearby Kelly Field Annex Kelly Field).<ref>Berg 1998, p. 73.</ref> Lindbergh had his most serious flying accident on {{nowrap March 5}}, 1925, eight days before graduation, when a midair collision with another Army Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 S.E.5 during aerial combat maneuvers forced him to bail out.<ref>Lindbergh 1927, pp. 144–148.</ref> Only 18 of the 104 cadets who started flight training a year earlier remained when Lindbergh graduated first overall in his class in March 1925, thereby earning his Army pilots wings and a commission as a Second Lieutenant#United States 2nd Lieutenant in the Military reserve force Air Service Reserve Corps.<ref>Moseley 1976, p. 56.</ref>{{refn Dates of military rank: Cadet, Army Air Corps – March 19, 1924, 2nd Lieutenant, Officer Reserve Corps (ORC) – March 14, 1925, 1st Lieutenant, ORC – December 7, 1925, Captain, ORC – July 13, 1926, Colonel, ORC – July 18, 1927 (As of 1927, Lindbergh was a member of the Missouri National Guard and was assigned to the 110th Observation Squadron in St. Louis.<ref>Official National Guard Register. 1927. p. 529.</ref>), Brigadier General, USAFR – April 7, 1954.<ref>Berg 1998, p. 488.</ref> group=N}}

Lindbergh later said that this year was critical to his development as both a focused, goal-oriented individual and as an aviator.{{refn "Always there was some new experience, always something interesting going on to make the time spent at Brooks and Kelly one of the banner years in a pilots life. The training is difficult and rigid, but there is none better. A cadet must be willing to forget all other interest in life when he enters the Texas flying schools and he must enter with the intention of devoting every effort and all of the energy during the next 12 months towards a single goal. But when he receives the wings at Kelly a year later, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he has graduated from one of the worlds finest flying schools." "WE" p. 125  group=N}} The Army did not need additional active-duty pilots, however, so immediately following graduation Lindbergh returned to civilian aviation as a barnstormer and flight instructor, although as a reserve officer he also continued to do some part-time military flying by joining the 110th Bomb Squadron 110th Observation Squadron, 35th Division, Missouri National Guard of the United States National Guard, in St. Louis. He was soon promoted to First Lieutenant#United States 1st Lieutenant, and to captain in July 1926.<ref name="American Aviator">[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/timeline/index.asp "Charles Lindbergh: An American Aviator"]. charleslindbergh.com.

===Air Mail pilot===

In October 1925, Lindbergh was hired by the Robertson Aircraft Corporation (RAC) at the Lambert-St. Louis International Airport Lambert-St. Louis Flying Field in Anglum, MO (where he had been working as a flight instructor) to first lay out and then serve as chief pilot for the newly designated {{convert 278 mi km adj=on}} Airmails of the United States#Beginning Contract Air Mail (CAM) service Contract Air Mail Route #2 (CAM-2) to provide service between St. Louis, Missouri St. Louis and Chicago (Maywood Field) with two intermediate stops in Springfield, Illinois Springfield and Peoria, Illinois.<ref>[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/mystory/thompson.asp "Robertson Aircraft Corporation"]. charleslindbergh.com.</ref> Lindbergh and three other RAC pilots, Philip R. Love, Thomas P. Nelson, and Harlan Gurney Harlan A. "Bud" Gurney, flew the mail over CAM-2 in a fleet of four modified war-surplus Airco DH.4 de Havilland DH-4 biplanes.

Just before signing on to fly with CAM, Lindbergh had applied to serve as a pilot on Richard E. Byrds North Pole expedition, but apparently his bid came too late.<ref name=Berg>Berg [http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781101494288,00.html?Lindbergh_A._Scott_Berg 1995, p. 95.]</ref>

The worlds first nonstop transatlantic flight (though at 1,890{{nbsp}}mi, or 3,040{{nbsp}}km, far shorter than Lindberghs 3,600{{nbsp}}mi, or 5,800{{nbsp}}km, flight) was made eight years earlier by British aviators Alcock and Brown John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown, in a modified Vickers Vimy IV bomber.

Around the same time, French-born New York hotelier Raymond Orteig was approached by Augustus Post, secretary of the Aero Club of America, and prompted to put up a $25,000 award for the first successful nonstop transatlantic flight specifically between New York City and Paris (in either direction) within five years after its establishment. When that time limit lapsed in 1924 without a serious attempt, Orteig renewed the offer for another five years, this time attracting a number of well-known, highly experienced, and well-financed contenders<ref>Lindbergh 1953, pp. 31, 74.</ref>{{mdashb}}none of whom were successful.

Financing the operation of the historic flight was a challenge due to Lindberghs obscurity, but two St. Louis businessmen eventually obtained a $15,000 bank loan. Lindbergh contributed $2,000 ($27,280.45 in 2017)<ref>[http://dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=2000&year=1927 dollartimes.com] Retrieved July 3, 2017</ref> of his own money and another $1,000 was donated by RAC.

===Autobiography and tours===
{{Main "WE" (1927 book)}}
Barely two months after Lindbergh arrived in Paris, G. P. Putnams Sons published his 318-page autobiography "WE", which was the first of 15 books he eventually wrote or to which he made significant contributions. The company was run by aviation enthusiast George P. Putnam.<ref>Herrmann, Anne [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?cc=mqr;c=mqr;c=mqrarchive;idno=act2080.0039.110;rgn=main;view=text;xc=1;g=mqrg "On Amelia Earhart: The Aviatrix as American Dandy"] Ann Arnbor, MI:The Michigan Quarterly Review Volume XXXIX, Issue 1, Winter 2000</ref>
The dustjacket notes said that Lindbergh wanted to share the "story of his life and his transatlantic flight together with his views on the future of aviation", and that "WE" referred to the "spiritual partnership" that had developed "between himself and his airplane during the dark hours of his flight".<ref>Wohl, Robert.

"WE" was soon translated into most major languages and sold more than 650,000 copies in the first year, earning Lindbergh more than $250,000.

Lindbergh used his fame to promote air mail service. For example, at the request of the owner of West Indian Aerial Express (and later Pan Ams chief pilot), in February 1928 he carried some 3,000 pieces of special souvenir mail between Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic R.D., Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and Havana, Cuba<ref>Streit, Clerence K.

Two weeks after his Latin American tour, Lindbergh piloted a series of special flights over his old CAM-2 route on {{nowrap February 20}} and {{nowrap February 21}}. Tens of thousands of self-addressed souvenir covers were sent in from all over the world, so at each stop Lindbergh switched to another of the three planes he and his fellow CAM-2 pilots had used, so it could be said that each cover had been flown by him. The covers were then backstamped and returned to their senders as promotion of the Air Mail Service.<ref>"Lindbergh Flies His Old Mail Route". The New York Times, February 21, 1928, p. 13.</ref>

In 1929–1931, Lindbergh carried much smaller numbers of souvenir covers on the first flights over routes in Latin America and the Caribbean, which he had earlier laid out as a consultant to Pan American World Airways Pan American Airways to be then flown under contract to the Post Office as Foreign Air Mail (FAM) routes 5 and 6.<ref>"The American Air Mail Catalogue" Fifth Edition, Volume 3, pp. 1418–1455 The American Air Mail Society (1978)</ref>

===Overseas visits===
At the request of the United States military, Lindbergh traveled to Germany several times between 1936 and 1938 to evaluate German aviation.<ref name="Time Magazine, January 19, 1939">Time magazine, January 19, 1939.</ref> Hanna Reitsch demonstrated the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 helicopter to Lindbergh in 1937,<ref name=Reitsch>Reitsch, H., 1955, The Sky My Kingdom, London: Biddles Limited, Guildford and Kings Lynn, {{ISBN 1853672629}}</ref>{{rp 121}}
and he was the first American to examine Germanys newest bomber, the Junkers Ju 88, and Germanys front-line fighter aircraft, the Messerschmitt Bf 109, which he was allowed to pilot.

In 1938, Hugh R. Wilson Hugh Wilson, the American ambassador to Germany, hosted a dinner for Lindbergh with Germanys air chief, Hermann Göring and three central figures in German aviation, Ernst Heinkel, Adolf Baeumker, and Willy Messerschmitt.
At this dinner Göring presented Lindbergh with the Commander Cross of the Order of the German Eagle. Lindberghs acceptance proved controversial after Kristallnacht, an anti-Jewish pogrom in Germany a few weeks later. Lindbergh declined to return the medal, later writing: "It seems to me that the returning of decorations, which were given in times of peace and as a gesture of friendship, can have no constructive effect. If I were to return the German medal, it seems to me that it would be an unnecessary insult. Even if war develops between us, I can see no gain in indulging in a spitting contest before that war begins."<ref>Ross 2006, p. 44.</ref>

===Non-Interventionism and America First involvement===
At the urging of U.S. Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. Joseph Kennedy, Lindbergh wrote a secret memo to the British warning that a military response by Britain and France to Hitlers violation of the Munich Agreement would be disastrous; he claimed that France was militarily weak and Britain over-reliant on its navy. He urgently recommended that they strengthen their air power to force Hitler to redirect his aggression against "Asiatic Communism".<ref name="Cole 1974">Cole 1974{{Page needed date=March 2012}}</ref>
In a controversial 1939 Readers Digest article he wrote, "Our civilization depends on peace among Western nations&nbsp;... and therefore on united strength, for Peace is a virgin who dare not show her face without Strength, her father, for protection."<ref>Lindbergh, Col.

{{anchor America First}}
Following Hitlers invasion of Czechoslovakia and Poland, Lindbergh decried suggestions that the United States should send aid to countries under threat,{{Elucidate date=January 2017 reason=to whom?}} writing "I do not believe that repealing the arms embargo would assist democracy in Europe" and<ref name="ReferenceA">October 13, 1939 speech excerpted in CharlesLindbergh.com</ref> "If we repeal the arms embargo with the idea of assisting one of the warring sides to overcome the other, then why mislead ourselves by talk of neutrality?"<ref name="ReferenceA"/> He equated assistance with war profiteering: "To those who argue that we could make a profit and build up our own industry by selling munitions abroad, I reply that we in America have not yet reached a point where we wish to capitalize on the destruction and death of war."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In late 1940 Lindbergh became spokesman of the non-interventionist America First Committee,<ref>Mosley 1976, p. 257.</ref> soon speaking to overflow crowds at Madison Square Garden (1925) Madison Square Garden and Chicagos Soldier Field, with millions listening by radio. He argued that America had no business attacking Germany; in writings published posthumously he justified this stance:

{{quote I was deeply concerned that the potentially gigantic power of America, guided by uninformed and impractical idealism, might crusade into Europe to destroy Hitler without realizing that Hitlers destruction would lay Europe open to the rape, loot and barbarism of Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Soviet Russias forces, causing possibly the fatal wounding of western civilization.<ref>Lindbergh 1977, p. 177</ref>}}

File:Amrally.jpg thumb upright=1.3 Lindbergh speaking at an AFC rally

In his 1941 testimony before the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs House Committee on Foreign Affairs opposing the Lend-Lease Lend-Lease bill, Lindbergh proposed that the United States negotiate a neutrality pact with Germany.<ref>"Urges Neutrality: Aviator Testifies He Wants Neither Side to Win Conflict". The New York Times, January 24, 1941, p. 1.</ref> President Franklin Roosevelt publicly decried Lindberghs views as those of a "defeatist and appeaser", comparing him to Clement Laird Vallandigham U.S. Rep. Clement L. Vallandigham, who had led the Copperheads (politics) "Copperhead" movement that had opposed the American Civil War. Lindbergh promptly resigned his commission as a colonel in the U.S. Army Air Corps, writing that he saw "no honorable alternative" given that Roosevelt had publicly questioned his loyalty.<ref>"Lingbergh Quits Air Corps; Sees His Loyalty Questioned". The New York Times, April 29, 1941, p. 1.</ref>

At an America First rally in September, Lindbergh accused three groups of "pressing this country toward war[:] the British, the Jewish, and the Roosevelt Administration":{{sfn  Bryson  2013  p=439}}

{{quote Instead of agitating for war, the Jewish groups in this country should be opposing it in every possible way for they will be among the first to feel its consequences.

History shows that it cannot survive war and devastation.<ref>[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/americanfirst/speech.asp "America First Speech"]. charleslindbergh.com. Retrieved: December 21, 2010.</ref>}}

He went on to warn of "large [Jewish] ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio, and our government", though he condemned Germanys antisemitism: "No person with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution of the Jewish race in Germany." He continued,

{{quote I am not attacking either the Jewish or the British people. Both races, I admire. But I am saying that the leaders of both the British and the Jewish races, for reasons which are as understandable from their viewpoint as they are inadvisable from ours, for reasons which are not American, wish to involve us in the war. We cannot blame them for looking out for what they believe to be their own interests, but we also must look out for ours. We cannot allow the natural passions and prejudices of other peoples to lead our country to destruction.<ref name="Des Moines">Extract from: [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/lindbergh/filmmore/reference/primary/desmoinesspeech.html "Des Moines Speech"].

Anne Lindbergh felt that the speech might tarnish Lindberghs reputation unjustly; she wrote in her diary:

Interventionism (politics) Interventionists created pamphlets pointing out his efforts were praised in Nazi Germany and included quotations such as "Racial strength is vital; politics, a luxury". They included pictures of him and other America Firsters using the stiff-armed Bellamy salute (a hand gesture described by Francis Bellamy to accompany his Pledge of Allegiance to the American flag); the photos were taken from an angle not showing the flag, so to observers it was indistinguishable from the Hitler salute.<ref>Birkhead, L.M. [http://www.charleslindbergh.com/pdf/Lindbergh.pdf "Is Lindbergh a Nazi?"] charleslindbergh.com. Retrieved: January 19, 2011.</ref>

Roosevelt disliked Lindberghs outspoken opposition to his administrations interventionist policies, telling Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. Henry Morgenthau, "If I should die tomorrow, I want you to know this, I am absolutely convinced Lindbergh is a Nazi."<ref>Cole 1974, p. 131.</ref> In 1941 he wrote to Secretary of War Henry Stimson: "When I read Lindberghs speech I felt that it could not have been better put if it had been written by Joseph Goebbels Goebbels himself. What a pity that this youngster has completely abandoned his belief in our form of government and has accepted Nazi methods because apparently they are efficient."<ref>Duffy, James P. "Lindbergh vs. Roosevelt: The Rivalry That Divided America" Washington, D.C.: Regnery Publishing. (2010) p. 181</ref>

===Attitudes toward race and racism===
Lindbergh elucidated his beliefs regarding White people white race in a 1939 article in Readers Digest:

{{quote text=We can have peace and security only so long as we band together to preserve that most priceless possession, our inheritance of European blood, only so long as we guard ourselves against attack by foreign armies and dilution by foreign races.<ref name=agr1939>Lindbergh, Charles. [http://library.flawlesslogic.com/lindy.htm "Aviation, Geography, and Race "]. Racial Nationalist Library. Retrieved: February 25, 2015.</ref>}}

Lindberghs speeches and writings reflected his adoption of views on race and religion similar to that of the Nazis.<ref>The Wartime Journals of Charles Lindbergh</ref>  Because of his trips to Nazi Germany that were combined with a belief in eugenics,<ref>Wallace 2005, pp. 83–85.</ref> Lindbergh was suspected of being a Nazi sympathizer.

Lindberghs reaction to Kristallnacht was entrusted to his diary: "I do not understand these riots on the part of the Germans," he wrote. "It seems so contrary to their sense of order and intelligence. They have undoubtedly had a difficult Jewish question Jewish problem, but why is it necessary to handle it so unreasonably?"<ref>Wallace 2005, p. 193.</ref> Lindbergh had planned to move to Berlin for the winter of 1938–39. He had provisionally found a house in Wannsee, but after Nazi friends discouraged him from leasing it because it had been formerly owned by Jews,<ref name="Wallace p. 175">Wallace 2005, p. 175.</ref> it was recommended that he contact Albert Speer, who said he would build the Lindberghs a house anywhere they wanted. On the advice of his close friend, Alexis Carrel, he cancelled the trip.<ref name="Wallace p. 175"/>

In his diaries, he wrote: "We must limit to a reasonable amount the Jewish influence&nbsp;... Whenever the Jewish percentage of total population becomes too high, a reaction seems to invariably occur. It is too bad because a few Jews of the right type are, I believe, an asset to any country."

;Nazi classification and racial definition

Lindberghs anticommunism resonated deeply with many Americans, while eugenics and Nordic race Nordicism enjoyed social acceptance.<ref name="Rosen"/>

Although Lindbergh considered Hitler a fanatic and avowed a belief in American democracy,<ref>Lindbergh, Charles A.

Lindbergh developed a long-term friendship with the automobile pioneer Henry Ford, who was well known for his anti-Semitic newspaper The Dearborn Independent. In a famous comment about Lindbergh to Detroits former FBI field office special agent in charge in July 1940, Ford said: "When Charles comes out here, we only talk about the Jews."<ref>Collier and Horowitz 1987, pp. 205 and note, p. 457.

Lindbergh considered Russia a "semi-Asiatic" country compared to Germany, and he believed Communism was an ideology that would destroy the Wests "racial strength" and replace everyone of European descent with "a pressing sea of Yellow, Black, and Brown". He stated that if he had to choose, he would rather see America allied with Nazi Germany than Soviet Russia. He preferred Nordic race Nordics, but he believed, after Soviet Communism was defeated, Russia would be a valuable ally against potential aggression from East Asia.<ref name="Eagle to Earth"/><ref name="preface">MacDonald, Kevin.

In his book The American Axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh and the Rise of the Third Reich The American Axis, Holocaust researcher and investigative journalist Max Wallace agreed with Franklin Roosevelts assessment that Lindbergh was "pro-Nazi". However, he found that the Roosevelt Administrations accusations of dual loyalty or treason were unsubstantiated. Wallace considered Lindbergh to be a well-intentioned but bigoted and misguided Nazi sympathizer whose career as the leader of the isolationist movement had a destructive impact on Jewish people.<ref>Wallace 2005, p. 358.</ref>

Lindberghs Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer, A. Scott Berg, contended that Lindbergh was not so much a supporter of the Nazi regime as someone so stubborn in his convictions and relatively inexperienced in political maneuvering that he easily allowed rivals to portray him as one. Lindberghs receipt of the German medal was approved without objection by the American embassy; the war had not yet begun in Europe. The award did not cause controversy until the war began and Lindbergh returned to the United States in 1939 to spread his message of nonintervention. Berg contended Lindberghs views were commonplace in the United States in the pre–World War II era. Lindberghs support for the America First Committee was representative of the sentiments of a number of American people.<ref>Berg 1998{{Page needed date=March 2012}}</ref>

Yet Berg also noted, "As late as April 1939{{mdashb}}after Germany overtook Czechoslovakia{{mdashb}}Lindbergh was willing to make excuses for Hitler. Much as I disapprove of many things Hitler had done, he wrote in his diary on {{nowrap April 2}}, 1939, I believe she [Germany] has pursued the only consistent policy in Europe in recent years. I cannot support her broken promises, but she has only moved a little faster than other nations&nbsp;... in breaking promises. The question of right and wrong is one thing by law and another thing by history." Berg also explained that leading up to the war, in Lindberghs mind, the great battle would be between the Soviet Union and Germany, not fascism and democracy.

Wallace noted that it was difficult to find social scientists among Lindberghs contemporaries in the 1930s who found validity in racial explanations for human behavior. Wallace went on to observe, "throughout his life, eugenics would remain one of Lindberghs enduring passions."<ref>Wallace 2005, p. 99.</ref>

Lindbergh always preached military strength and alertness.<ref>Lindbergh, Charles A.

Berg revealed that while the attack on Pearl Harbor came as a shock to Lindbergh, he did predict that Americas "wavering policy in the Philippines" would invite a bloody war there, and, in one speech, he warned, "we should either fortify these islands adequately, or get out of them entirely."<ref>Berg 1998{{Page needed date=January 2016}}</ref>

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Lindbergh sought to be recommissioned in the USAAF. The Secretary of War, Henry L.

Unable to take on an active military role, Lindbergh approached a number of aviation companies and offered his services as a consultant. As a technical adviser with Ford in 1942, he was heavily involved in troubleshooting early problems encountered at the Willow Run Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber production line. As B-24 production smoothed out, he joined United Aircraft in 1943 as an engineering consultant, devoting most of his time to its Chance-Vought Chance-Vought Division.<ref>Herman, Arthur.

The following year, Lindbergh persuaded United Aircraft to designate him as a technical representative in the Pacific War Pacific Theater to study aircraft performances under combat conditions. Among other things, he showed Marine pilots how to take off safely with a bomb load double the Vought F4U Corsair fighter-bombers rated capacity. At the time, several Marine squadrons were flying bomber escorts to destroy the Japanese stronghold of Rabaul, New Britain, in the Australian Territory of New Guinea. On {{nowrap May 21}}, 1944, Lindbergh flew his first combat mission: a strafing run with VMF-222 near the Japanese garrison of Rabaul.<ref name="mersky"/> He also flew with VMF-216, from the Marine Air Base at Torokina, Bougainville Island Bougainville. Lindbergh was escorted on one of these missions by Lt. Robert E.

After World War II, Lindbergh lived in Darien, Connecticut Darien, Connecticut and served as a consultant to the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force and to Pan American World Airways. With most of eastern Europe under Communist control, Lindbergh believed that his prewar assessments of the Soviet threat were correct. Lindbergh witnessed firsthand the defeat of Germany and the Holocaust, and Berg reported, "he knew the American public no longer gave a hoot about his opinions." In 1954, on the recommendation of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lindbergh was commissioned a Brigadier general (United States) brigadier general in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. Also in that year, he served on a Congressional advisory panel that recommended the site of the United States Air Force Academy.{{Citation needed date = May 2017}}
