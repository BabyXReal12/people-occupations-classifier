<strong>
 Charles Augustus Lindbergh
</strong>
(February 4, 1902 – August 26, 1974), nicknamed Lucky Lindy, The Lone Eagle, and Slim
was an American aviator, military officer, author, inventor, explorer, and environmental activist. At age 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a U.S. Air Mail pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the Orteig Prize: making a nonstop flight from Roosevelt Field (airport) Roosevelt Field, Long Island, New York (state) New York, to Paris, France. Lindbergh covered the {{frac 33 1 2}}-hour, {{convert 3,600 smi km}} alone in a single-engine purpose-built Ryan monoplane, Spirit of St. Louis. This was not the Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown first flight between North America and Europe, but he did achieve the first solo transatlantic flight and the first non-stop flight between North America and the European mainland. Lindbergh was an officer in the United States Army Reserve U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve, and he received the United States highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, for the feat.{{sfn  Bryson  2013  pp=25–104}}

His achievement spurred interest in both commercial aviation and air mail, and Lindbergh himself devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. Lindberghs historic flight and celebrity status led to tragedy. In March 1932, his infant son, Charles Jr., Lindbergh kidnapping was kidnapped and murdered in what American media called the "Crime of the Century" and described by H. L. Mencken H. L. Mencken as "the biggest story since the Resurrection of Jesus Resurrection".
The case prompted the United States Congress to establish Federal Kidnapping Act kidnapping as a federal crime once the kidnapper had crossed state lines with their victim. By late 1935 the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into voluntary exile in Europe, from which they returned in 1939.

Before the United States formally entered World War II, some people accused Lindbergh of being a fascism fascist sympathizer. An advocate of non-interventionism
he supported the antiwar America First Committee, which opposed American aid to Britain in its war against Germany, and resigned his commission in the United States Army Air Forces in 1941 after President Franklin Roosevelt publicly rebuked him for his views. Nevertheless, he publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and flew fifty combat missions in the Pacific War Pacific Theater of World War II as a civilian consultant{{Citation needed date=June 2018}}, though Roosevelt refused to reinstate his Air Corps colonels commission.
In his later years, Lindbergh became a prolific prize-winning author, international explorer, inventor, and environmentalist.

Lindbergh and his wife, the former Anne Morrow, were the parents of six children. In 2003—twenty-nine years after Lindberghs death and two years after his wife died—it was revealed that beginning in 1957 (when he was 55 years old), Lindbergh had engaged in several covert adulterous affairs with three European women, with whom he fathered seven more children, none of whom learned of their  fathers true identity until a decade after his 1974 death.

==Rise to fame==
===Early childhood===
File:Charles&amp;Dad.jpg thumb right upright=0.75 Charles A. Lindbergh and his father, circa 1910

Lindbergh was born in Detroit, Michigan, on {{nowrap February 4}}, 1902, and spent most of his childhood in Little Falls, Minnesota, and Washington, D.C. He was the third child of Charles August Lindbergh (Name at birth birth name Carl Månsson; 1859–1924) who had emigrated from Sweden to Melrose, Minnesota as an infant, and his only child with his second wife, Evangeline Lodge Land Lindbergh (1876–1954), of Detroit. Charles parents separated in 1909 when he was seven.
Lindberghs father, a United States Congress U.S. Congressman (Republican Party (United States) R-Minnesota MN-6) from 1907 to 1917, was one of the few Congressmen to oppose the entry of the U.S. into World War I (although his Congressional term ended one month prior to the House of Representatives voting to declare war on Germany).
Lindberghs mother was a chemistry teacher at Cass Technical High School in Detroit and later at Little Falls High School, from which her son graduated on {{nowrap June 5}}, 1918. Lindbergh also attended over a dozen other schools from Washington, D.C., to California, during his childhood and teenage years (none for more than a year or two), including the Force School and Sidwell Friends School while living in Washington with his father, and Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California, while living there with his mother.
Although he enrolled in the College of Engineering at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in late 1920, Lindbergh dropped out in the middle of his sophomore year and then went to Lincoln, Nebraska, in March 1922 to begin flight training.
===Early aviation career===

From an early age, Lindbergh had exhibited an interest in the mechanics of motorized transportation, including his familys Saxon (automobile) Saxon Six automobile, and later his Excelsior Motor Manufacturing &amp; Supply Company Excelsior motorbike. By the time he started college as a mechanical engineering student, he had also become fascinated with flying, though he "had never been close enough to a plane to touch it".
After quitting college in February 1922, Lindbergh enrolled at the Nebraska Aircraft Corporations flying school in Lincoln and flew for the first time on {{nowrap April 9}}, as a passenger in a two-seat Standard J Lincoln Standard "Tourabout" biplane trainer piloted by Otto Timm.
A few days later, Lindbergh took his first formal flying lesson in that same machine, though he was never permitted to solo because he could not afford to post the requisite damage bond.
To gain flight experience and earn money for further instruction, Lindbergh left Lincoln in June to spend the next few months barnstorming across Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana as a wing walking wing walker and Parachuting parachutist. He also briefly worked as an airplane mechanic at the Billings, Montana, municipal airport.

Lindbergh left flying with the onset of winter and returned to his fathers home in Minnesota.
His return to the air and first solo flight did not come until half a year later in May 1923 at Jimmy Carter Regional Airport Souther Field in Americus, Georgia, a former Army flight training field, where he had come to buy a World War I surplus Curtiss JN-4 Curtiss JN-4 "Jenny" biplane. Though Lindbergh had not touched an airplane in more than six months, he had already secretly decided he was ready to take to the air by himself. After a half-hour of dual time with a pilot who was visiting the field to pick up another surplus JN-4, Lindbergh flew solo for the first time in the Jenny he had just purchased for $500.
After spending another week or so at the field to "practice" (thereby acquiring five hours of "pilot in command" time), Lindbergh took off from Americus for Montgomery, Alabama, some 140 miles to the west, for his first solo cross-country flight.
He went on to spend much of the rest of 1923 engaged in almost nonstop barnstorming under the name of "Daredevil Lindbergh". Unlike the previous year, this time Lindbergh flew in his "own ship" as pilot.
A few weeks after leaving Americus, the young airman also achieved another key aviation milestone when he made his first flight at night near Lake Village, Arkansas.

While Lindbergh was barnstorming in Lone Rock, Wisconsin, on two occasions he flew a local physician across the Wisconsin River to emergency calls that were otherwise unreachable due to flooding.
He broke his propeller several times while landing, and on {{nowrap June 3}}, 1923 he was grounded for a week when he ran into a ditch in Glencoe, Minnesota while flying his father—then running for the U.S. Senate—to a campaign stop. In October, Lindbergh flew his Jenny to Iowa, where he sold it to a flying student. After selling the Jenny, Lindbergh returned to Lincoln by train. There, he joined Leon Klink and continued to barnstorm through the South for the next few months in Klinks Curtiss JN-4C "Canuck" (the Canadian version of the Jenny). Lindbergh also "cracked up" this aircraft once when his engine failed shortly after take-off in Pensacola, Florida, but again he managed to repair the damage himself.
Following a few months of barnstorming through the South, the two pilots parted company in San Antonio, Texas, where Lindbergh reported to Brooks City-Base Brooks Field on {{nowrap March 19}}, 1924, to begin a year of military flight training with the United States Army Air Service there (and later at nearby Kelly Field Annex Kelly Field).
Lindbergh had his most serious flying accident on {{nowrap March 5}}, 1925, eight days before graduation, when a midair collision with another Army Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 S.E.5 during aerial combat maneuvers forced him to bail out.
Only 18 of the 104 cadets who started flight training a year earlier remained when Lindbergh graduated first overall in his class in March 1925, thereby earning his Army pilots wings and a commission as a Second Lieutenant#United States 2nd Lieutenant in the Military reserve force Air Service Reserve Corps.
{{refn Dates of military rank: Cadet, Army Air Corps – March 19, 1924, 2nd Lieutenant, Officer Reserve Corps (ORC) – March 14, 1925, 1st Lieutenant, ORC – December 7, 1925, Captain, ORC – July 13, 1926, Colonel, ORC – July 18, 1927 (As of 1927, Lindbergh was a member of the Missouri National Guard and was assigned to the 110th Observation Squadron in St. Louis.
), Brigadier General, USAFR – April 7, 1954.
group=N}}

Lindbergh later said that this year was critical to his development as both a focused, goal-oriented individual and as an aviator.{{refn "Always there was some new experience, always something interesting going on to make the time spent at Brooks and Kelly one of the banner years in a pilots life. The training is difficult and rigid, but there is none better. A cadet must be willing to forget all other interest in life when he enters the Texas flying schools and he must enter with the intention of devoting every effort and all of the energy during the next 12 months towards a single goal. But when he receives the wings at Kelly a year later, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he has graduated from one of the worlds finest flying schools." "WE" p. 125  group=N}} The Army did not need additional active-duty pilots, however, so immediately following graduation Lindbergh returned to civilian aviation as a barnstormer and flight instructor, although as a reserve officer he also continued to do some part-time military flying by joining the 110th Bomb Squadron 110th Observation Squadron, 35th Division, Missouri National Guard of the United States National Guard, in St. Louis. He was soon promoted to First Lieutenant#United States 1st Lieutenant, and to captain in July 1926.
===Air Mail pilot===
File:CharlesLindbergh PostOfficeOath.jpg thumb left upright=1.1

In October 1925, Lindbergh was hired by the Robertson Aircraft Corporation (RAC) at the Lambert-St. Louis International Airport Lambert-St. Louis Flying Field in Anglum, MO (where he had been working as a flight instructor) to first lay out and then serve as chief pilot for the newly designated {{convert 278 mi km adj=on}} Airmails of the United States#Beginning Contract Air Mail (CAM) service Contract Air Mail Route #2 (CAM-2) to provide service between St. Louis, Missouri St. Louis and Chicago (Maywood Field) with two intermediate stops in Springfield, Illinois Springfield and Peoria, Illinois.
Lindbergh and three other RAC pilots, Philip R. Love, Thomas P. Nelson, and Harlan Gurney Harlan A. "Bud" Gurney, flew the mail over CAM-2 in a fleet of four modified war-surplus Airco DH.4 de Havilland DH-4 biplanes.

Just before signing on to fly with CAM, Lindbergh had applied to serve as a pilot on Richard E. Byrds North Pole expedition, but apparently his bid came too late.
On {{nowrap April 13}}, 1926, Lindbergh executed the Post Office Departments Oath of Mail Messengers,
and two days later he opened service on the new route. Twice combinations of bad weather, equipment failure, and fuel exhaustion forced him to bail out on night approach to Chicago;
both times he reached the ground without serious injury and immediately set about ensuring his cargo was located and sent on with minimum delay.
In mid-February 1927 he left for San Diego, California, to oversee design and construction of the Spirit of St. Louis.

===Orteig Prize===
{{Main Orteig Prize}}

The worlds first nonstop transatlantic flight (though at 1,890{{nbsp}}mi, or 3,040{{nbsp}}km, far shorter than Lindberghs 3,600{{nbsp}}mi, or 5,800{{nbsp}}km, flight) was made eight years earlier by British aviators Alcock and Brown John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown, in a modified Vickers Vimy IV bomber. They left St. Johns, Newfoundland and Labrador St. Johns, Newfoundland on {{nowrap June 14}}, 1919 and arrived in Ireland, the following day.
Around the same time, French-born New York hotelier Raymond Orteig was approached by Augustus Post, secretary of the Aero Club of America, and prompted to put up a $25,000 award for the first successful nonstop transatlantic flight specifically between New York City and Paris (in either direction) within five years after its establishment. When that time limit lapsed in 1924 without a serious attempt, Orteig renewed the offer for another five years, this time attracting a number of well-known, highly experienced, and well-financed contenders
{{mdashb}}none of whom were successful. On {{nowrap September 21}}, 1926 World War{{nbsp}}I French flying ace René Foncks Sikorsky S-35 crashed on takeoff from Roosevelt Field in New York. U.S. Naval aviators Wooster and Davis Noel Davis and Wooster and Davis Stanton H. Wooster were killed at Langley Air Force Base Langley Field, Virginia on {{nowrap April 26}}, 1927, while testing their Keystone Pathfinder. On {{nowrap May 8}} French war heroes Charles Nungesser and François Coli departed Paris – Le Bourget Airport in the Levasseur PL.2 Levasseur PL 8 seaplane The White Bird LOiseau Blanc; they disappeared over the coast of Ireland.
American air racer Clarence Duncan Chamberlin Clarence D. Chamberlin and Arctic explorer Richard E. Byrd were also in the race.{{Elucidate date=January 2017}}

===Spirit of St. Louis===
File:Lindbergh check.jpg thumb right Part of the funding for the Spirit of St. Louis came from Lindberghs earnings as a U.S. Air Mail pilot.

Financing the operation of the historic flight was a challenge due to Lindberghs obscurity, but two St. Louis businessmen eventually obtained a $15,000 bank loan. Lindbergh contributed $2,000 ($27,280.45 in 2017)
of his own money and another $1,000 was donated by RAC. The total of $18,000 was far less than was available to Lindberghs rivals.
The group tried to buy an "off-the-peg" single or multiengine monoplane from Wright Aeronautical, then Travel Air, and finally the newly formed Columbia Aircraft Corporation, but all insisted on selecting the pilot as a condition of sale.
Finally the much smaller Ryan Aeronautical Ryan Aircraft Company of San Diego agreed to design and build a custom monoplane for $10,580, and on {{nowrap February 25}} a deal was formally closed.
Dubbed the Spirit of St. Louis, the fabric-covered, single-seat, single-engine "Ryan NYP" high-wing monoplane (Civil Aeronautics Authority CAB registration: N-X-211) was designed jointly by Lindbergh and the Ryans chief engineer Donald A. Hall.
The Spirit flew for the first time just two months later, and after a series of test flights Lindbergh took off from San Diego on {{nowrap May 10}}. He went first to St. Louis, then on to Roosevelt Field on New Yorks Long Island.
===Flight===
File:Charles Lindbergh and the Spirit of Saint Louis (Crisco restoration, with wings).jpg thumb left upright=0.75 Lindbergh with the Spirit of St. Louis before his Paris flight

In the early morning of Friday, {{nowrap May 20}}, 1927, Lindbergh took off from Roosevelt Field (airport) Roosevelt Field across the Atlantic Ocean for Paris, France.
His monoplane was loaded with 450 U.S. gallons (1,704 liters) of Aviation fuel fuel that was strained repeatedly to avoid fuel line blockage. The fully loaded aircraft weighed {{convert 5135 lb abbr=on}}, and takeoff was hampered by a muddy, rain-soaked runway. Lindberghs monoplane was powered by a Wright R-790 Whirlwind J-5C Wright Whirlwind radial engine and gained speed very slowly during its 7:52{{nbsp}}a.m. takeoff, but cleared telephone lines at the far end of the field "by about twenty feet [six meters] with a fair reserve of flying speed".
Over the next {{frac 33 1 2}} hours, Lindbergh and the Spirit faced many challenges, which included skimming over Cumulonimbus cloud storm clouds at {{convert 10000 ft m abbr=on}} and wave tops at as low as {{convert 10 ft m abbr=on}}. The aircraft fought Icing conditions icing, flew blind through fog for several hours, and Lindbergh navigated only by Dead reckoning#Air navigation dead reckoning. (He was not proficient at navigating Celestial navigation by the sun and stars and he rejected radio navigation gear as heavy and unreliable. He was fortunate that the winds over the Atlantic cancelled each other out, giving him zero wind drift – and thus accurate navigation during the long flight over featureless ocean.)
He landed at Paris – Le Bourget Airport Le Bourget Aerodrome
at 10:22 p.m. on Saturday, {{nowrap May 21}}.
The airfield was not marked on his map and Lindbergh knew only that it was some seven miles northeast of the city; he initially mistook it for some large industrial complex because of the bright lights spreading out in all directions{{mdashb}}in fact the headlights of tens of thousands of spectators cars caught in "the largest traffic jam in Paris history" in their attempt to be present for Lindberghs landing.

A crowd estimated at 150,000 stormed the field, dragged Lindbergh out of the cockpit, and literally carried him around above their heads for "nearly half an hour". Some damage was done to the Spirit (especially to the fine linen, silver-painted fabric covering on the fuselage) by souvenir hunters before pilot and plane reached the safety of a nearby hangar with the aid of French military fliers, soldiers, and police.
Lindberghs flight was certified by the National Aeronautic Association based on the readings from a sealed barograph placed in the Spirit.
==Fame==
File:CharlesLindbergh-RaymondOrteig.jpg left upright=0.75 thumb Lindbergh accepting the prize from Orteig in New York, {{nowrap June 16}}, 1927
Lindbergh received unprecedented adulation after his historic flight. People were "behaving as though Lindbergh had walked on water, not flown over it".
{{rp 17}}
His mothers house in Detroit was surrounded by a crowd estimated at about 1,000.
Countless newspapers, magazines, and radio shows wanted to interview him, and he was flooded with job offers from companies, think tanks, and universities.

The French Foreign Office flew the American flag, the first time it had saluted someone who wasnt a head of state.
Lindbergh also made a series of brief flights to Belgium and Great Britain in the Spirit before returning to the United States. Gaston Doumergue, the President of France, bestowed the French Légion dhonneur on Lindbergh,{{sfn  Bryson  2013  p=101}} and on his arrival back in the United States aboard the U.S. Navy cruiser {{USS Memphis CL-13}} on {{nowrap June 11}}, 1927, a fleet of warships and multiple flights of military aircraft escorted him up the Potomac River to the Washington Navy Yard, where President Calvin Coolidge awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Distinguished Flying Cross.
The United States Postal Service#History U.S. Post Office Department issued a 10-cent Airmails of the United States Air Mail stamp (Scott C-10) depicting the Spirit and a map of the flight.

Lindbergh flew from Washington, D.C. to New York City on {{nowrap June 13}}, arriving in lower Manhattan. He traveled up the Broadway (Manhattan)#Canyon of Heroes Canyon of Heroes to City Hall, where he was received by Mayor Jimmy Walker. A ticker-tape parade
followed to Central Park Mall, where he was honored at another ceremony hosted by New York Governor Al Smith and attended by a crowd of 200,000. Some 4,000,000 persons saw Lindbergh that day.
That evening,  Lindbergh was accompanied by his mother and Mayor Walker when he was the guest of honor at a 500-guest banquet and dance held at Clarence MacKays Long Island estate, Harbor Hill.
The following night, Lindbergh was honored with a grand banquet at the Hotel Commodore given by the Mayors Committee on Receptions of the City of New York and attended by some 3,700 people.
He was officially awarded the check for the prize on {{nowrap June 16}}.
On July 18, 1927, Lindbergh was promoted to the rank of colonel in the Air Corps of the Officers Reserve Corps of the U.S. Army.
On {{nowrap December 14}}, 1927, a Special Act of Congress awarded Lindbergh the Medal of Honor, despite the fact that it was almost always awarded for heroism in combat.
It was presented to Lindbergh by President Coolidge at the White House on {{nowrap March 21}}.
Other noncombat awards of the Medal of Honor were made to naval aviators Richard E. Byrd and Floyd Bennett, as well as arctic explorer Adolphus W. Greely.

Lindbergh was honored as the first Time (magazine) Time magazine Time Magazine Person of the Year "Man of the Year" when he appeared on that magazines cover at age 25 {{nowrap January 2}}, 1928; he remains the youngest Man of the Year ever.
The winner of the 1930 Best Woman Aviator of the Year Award, Elinor Smith Elinor Smith Sullivan, said that before Lindberghs flight,

{{quote People seemed to think we [aviators] were from outer space or something. But after Charles Lindberghs flight, we could do no wrong. Its hard to describe the impact Lindbergh had on people. Even the first walk on the moon doesnt come close. The twenties was such an innocent time, and people were still so religious—I think they felt like this man was sent by God to do this. And it changed aviation forever because all of a sudden the Wall Streeters were banging on doors looking for airplanes to invest in. Wed been standing on our heads trying to get them to notice us but after Lindbergh, suddenly everyone wanted to fly, and there werent enough planes to carry them.

===Autobiography and tours===
{{Main "WE" (1927 book)}}
Barely two months after Lindbergh arrived in Paris, G. P. Putnams Sons published his 318-page autobiography "WE", which was the first of 15 books he eventually wrote or to which he made significant contributions. The company was run by aviation enthusiast George P. Putnam.
The dustjacket notes said that Lindbergh wanted to share the "story of his life and his transatlantic flight together with his views on the future of aviation", and that "WE" referred to the "spiritual partnership" that had developed "between himself and his airplane during the dark hours of his flight".
But Putnams had selected the title without Lindberghs knowledge, and he complained, "we" actually referred to himself and his St. Louis financial backers, though his frequent unconscious use of the phrase seemed to suggest otherwise.{{explain date=January 2017}}
"WE" was soon translated into most major languages and sold more than 650,000 copies in the first year, earning Lindbergh more than $250,000. Its success was considerably aided by Lindberghs three-month, {{convert 22,350 mi km adj=on}} tour of the United States in the Spirit on behalf of the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics. Between {{nowrap July 20}} and {{nowrap October 23}}, 1927 Lindbergh visited 82 cities in all 48 states, delivered 147 speeches, rode {{convert 1290 mi km abbr=on}} in parades,

A year and two days after it had made its first flight, Lindbergh flew the Spirit from St. Louis to Washington, D.C., where it has been on public display at the Smithsonian Institution ever since.
Over the previous 367 days, Lindbergh and the Spirit had logged 489 hours 28 minutes of flight time together.

A "Lindbergh boom" in aviation had begun. The volume of mail moving by air{{where date=January 2017}} increased 50 percent within six months, applications for pilots licenses tripled, and the number of planes quadrupled.
