== Biography ==
Rusjan was born in Trieste,<ref name="Rusjan" /> then the major port of Austria-Hungary (now in Italy). His parents were both natives of the Gorizia and Gradisca region: his father, Franc Rusjan, was a Slovenes Slovene, and his mother, Grazia Cabas, was Friuli-Venezia Giulia Friulan.<ref>{{cite book  title=Brata Edvard in Josip Rusjan iz Gorice: začetkí motornega letenja med Slovenci  first=Srečko  last=Gombač  year=2004  publisher=Puhek}}</ref> Rusjan spent his childhood and adolescence in Gorizia, in the suburb of Pristava, Nova Gorica Rafut.

In his youth, he became a professional bicyclist, and designed his own bicycle models, together with his brother Josip Rusjan. He was also member of the Sokol gymnastic association.

He made his first flight on 25 November 1909, near Gorizia, in Eda I, a biplane of his own design. Eda was Edvards nickname, given from his mother. <ref name="Rusjan" /><ref name="RS-Rusjan">{{cite web url=http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_relations/background_information/science_and_technology/edvard_rusjan_pioneer_of_slovene_aviation/ last= first= title=Edvard Rusjan, Pioneer of Slovene Aviation date= publisher=Republic of Slovenia – Government Communication Office accessdate=11 September 2013 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423044448/http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_relations/background_information/science_and_technology/edvard_rusjan_pioneer_of_slovene_aviation/ archivedate=23 April 2014 df=}}</ref>

The brothers Rusjan ran out of finance for the construction of EDA VII. In 1910 Edvard Rusjan met the businessman of Serbian origin Mihailo Merćep Mihajlo Merćep, who offered him financial help for his endeavors. The same year, the brothers moved to Zagreb, Croatia, when they started a project of airplane construction on larger scale. In November 1910, they constructed a new model.<ref name="Rusjan" />

In January 1911, Edvard and Josip Rusjan went on a promotional tour through the Balkan cities.  During a flight in Belgrade, Serbia on 9 January 1911 a strong wind broke a wing of Edvards aeroplane and it dived into a railway embankment near the Belgrade Fortress in a fatal crash.<ref name="Sitar">{{cite book  title=Edvard Rusjan  first=Sandi  last=Sitar  year=1989  page=72  publisher=Partizanska knjiga  id={{COBISS ID=7780352}}}}</ref><ref name="RS-Rusjan"/> His funeral was attended by a large crowd of about 14,000 people.
