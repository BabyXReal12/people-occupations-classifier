==Career==

===UK career===
Fergusons experience in entertainment began as a drummer in a rock band called Exposure. He then joined a punk rock punk band called The Bastards from Hell. The band, later renamed "Dreamboys", and fronted by vocalist Peter Capaldi, performed regularly in Glasgow from 1980 to 1982.<ref name="AmericanOnPurpose">{{harvnb Ferguson 2009}}</ref> Ferguson credits Capaldi for inspiring him to try comedy.<ref name="nyt09">{{cite news  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/books/review/Borowitz-t.html  title=The&nbsp;Scotsman  work=The New York Times  first=Andy  last=Borowitz  authorlink=Andy Borowitz  date=1 October 2009  accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref>

After a nerve-wracking first appearance, he decided to create a character that was a "parody of all the über-patriotic native folk singers who seemed to infect every public performance in Scotland".<ref name="nyt09"/> The character, "Bing Hitler" (actually coined by Capaldi as Ferguson started under the name "Nico Fulton" but admittedly later stole the name for his "own nefarious ends"),<ref name="AmericanOnPurpose"/> premiered in Glasgow, and subsequently became a hit at the 1986 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

===US career===
Ferguson moved to Los Angeles in November 1994 after his soon-to-be agent Rick Siegel saw Ferguson during the Edinburgh Festival and suggested he come to America.{{sfn Ferguson 2009 loc=ch. 31}} His first US role was as baker Logan McDonough on the short-lived 1995 American Broadcasting Company ABC comedy Maybe This Time, which starred Betty White and Marie Osmond.

His breakthrough in the US came when he was cast on The Drew Carey Show as the title characters boss, Mr. Wick, a role that he played from 1996 to 2003. He played the role with an over-the-top posh English accent "to make up for generations of English actors doing crap Scottish accents". In his comedy special "A Wee Bit O Revolution", he specifically identified James Doohans portrayal of Montgomery Scott on Star Trek: The Original Series Star Trek as the foundation of his "revenge". (At the end of one episode, though, Ferguson broke the fourth wall and began talking to the audience at home in his regular Scottish accent.) His character was memorable for his unique methods of laying employees off, almost always "firing Johnson", the most common last name of the to-be-fired workers.<ref name="sunday">{{cite news  url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article3868137.ece  title=Craig Ferguson may be next Letterman  work=The Sunday Times  first=Mark  last=Macaskill  date=4 May 2008  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517065353/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article3868137.ece  archivedate=17 May 2008}}</ref> Even after leaving the show in 2003, he remained a recurring character on the series for the last two seasons, and was part of the two part series finale in 2004.

During production of The Drew Carey Show, Ferguson devoted his off-time as a cast member to writing, working in his trailer on set in between shooting his scenes. He wrote and starred in three films: The Big Tease, Saving Grace (2000 film) Saving Grace, and Ill Be There (2003 film) Ill Be There, which he also directed and for which he won the Audience Award for Best Film at the Aspen, Dallas and Valencia film festivals. He was named Best New Director at the Napa Valley Film Festival. These were among other scripts that, "... in the great tradition of the movie business, about half a dozen that I got paid a fortune for but never got made."<ref>{{cite episode  title=Episode dated 17 February 2009  series=Conversations with Michael Eisner  network=CNBC  date=17 February 2009}}</ref>
