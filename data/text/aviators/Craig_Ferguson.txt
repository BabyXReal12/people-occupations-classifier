and raised in nearby Cumbernauld, growing up "chubby and bullied".
{{sfn  Ferguson  2009  pp=14–15}} When he was six months old, he and his family moved from their Springburn flat to a council house in Cumbernauld. They lived there as Glasgow was re-housing many people following Clydebank Blitz damage to the city from World War II.{{sfn  Ferguson  2009  pp=14–15}}  Ferguson attended Muirfield Primary School
and Cumbernauld High School.{{sfn  Ferguson  2009  p=31}} At age sixteen, Ferguson left Cumbernauld High School and began an apprenticeship to be an electronics technician at a local factory of American company Burroughs Corporation.{{sfn  Ferguson  2009  pp=66–68}}

==Career==

===UK career===
Fergusons experience in entertainment began as a drummer in a rock band called Exposure. He then joined a punk rock punk band called The Bastards from Hell. The band, later renamed "Dreamboys", and fronted by vocalist Peter Capaldi, performed regularly in Glasgow from 1980 to 1982.
Ferguson credits Capaldi for inspiring him to try comedy.
After a nerve-wracking first appearance, he decided to create a character that was a "parody of all the über-patriotic native folk singers who seemed to infect every public performance in Scotland".
The character, "Bing Hitler" (actually coined by Capaldi as Ferguson started under the name "Nico Fulton" but admittedly later stole the name for his "own nefarious ends"),
premiered in Glasgow, and subsequently became a hit at the 1986 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.  A recording of his stage act as Bing Hitler was made at Glasgows Tron Theatre and released in the 1980s;
a Bing Hitler monologue ("A Lecture for Burns Night") appears on the compilation cassette Honey at the Core.

After enjoying success at the Edinburgh Festival, Ferguson appeared on television as Confidence in Red Dwarf, STV (TV channel) STVs Hogmanay Show,
and the 1993 One Foot in the Grave Christmas special One Foot in the Algarve. In 1990 a pilot was broadcast The Craig Ferguson Show, a one-off comedy pilot for Granada Television, which co-starred Paul Whitehouse and Helen Atkinson-Wood.
This was followed by Fergusons own 1992 show 2000 Not Out. In 1993, Ferguson presented a series on Scottish archaeology for Scottish Television entitled Dirt Detective.
He travelled throughout the country examining archaeological history, including Skara Brae and Paisley Abbey. He will return to UK television for the first time in 25 years
in a guest role in BBC Scotland BBC Scotlands comedy Still Game in 2017,
to be shown in 2018.

Ferguson also found success in musical theatre. Beginning in 1991, he appeared on stage as Brad Majors in the London production of The Rocky Horror Show.
In 1994, Ferguson played Father MacLean in  production of Bad Boy Johnny and the Prophets of Doom at the Union Chapel, Islington Union Chapel in London. The same year, he appeared again at the Edinburgh Fringe, as Oscar Madison in The Odd Couple (play) The Odd Couple.
===US career===
Ferguson moved to Los Angeles in November 1994 after his soon-to-be agent Rick Siegel saw Ferguson during the Edinburgh Festival and suggested he come to America.{{sfn Ferguson 2009 loc=ch. 31}} His first US role was as baker Logan McDonough on the short-lived 1995 American Broadcasting Company ABC comedy Maybe This Time, which starred Betty White and Marie Osmond.

His breakthrough in the US came when he was cast on The Drew Carey Show as the title characters boss, Mr. Wick, a role that he played from 1996 to 2003. He played the role with an over-the-top posh English accent "to make up for generations of English actors doing crap Scottish accents". In his comedy special "A Wee Bit O Revolution", he specifically identified James Doohans portrayal of Montgomery Scott on Star Trek: The Original Series Star Trek as the foundation of his "revenge". (At the end of one episode, though, Ferguson broke the fourth wall and began talking to the audience at home in his regular Scottish accent.) His character was memorable for his unique methods of laying employees off, almost always "firing Johnson", the most common last name of the to-be-fired workers.
Even after leaving the show in 2003, he remained a recurring character on the series for the last two seasons, and was part of the two part series finale in 2004.

During production of The Drew Carey Show, Ferguson devoted his off-time as a cast member to writing, working in his trailer on set in between shooting his scenes. He wrote and starred in three films: The Big Tease, Saving Grace (2000 film) Saving Grace, and Ill Be There (2003 film) Ill Be There, which he also directed and for which he won the Audience Award for Best Film at the Aspen, Dallas and Valencia film festivals. He was named Best New Director at the Napa Valley Film Festival. These were among other scripts that, "... in the great tradition of the movie business, about half a dozen that I got paid a fortune for but never got made."
His other acting credits in films include Niagara Motel, Lenny the Wonder Dog, Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events, Chain of Fools (film) Chain of Fools, Born Romantic, The Ugly Truth (film) The Ugly Truth, Kick-Ass (film) Kick-Ass, and as a voice-over actor, How to Train Your Dragon (film) How to Train Your Dragon, How to Train Your Dragon 2, Brave (2012 film) Brave, and Winnie the Pooh (2011 film) Winnie the Pooh.
Ferguson has been touring the United States and Canada with a comedy show since the late 2000s, including a performance at Carnegie Hall on 23 October 2010 and a performance at Radio City Music Hall on 6 October 2012. He has performed two stand-up television specials on Comedy Central, both released on DVD: A Wee Bit o Revolution in 2009 and Does This Need to Be Said? in 2011. His third comedy special, Im Here to Help, was released on Netflix in 2013, garnering positive reviews on 4 out of 5 stars on Netflix and peaking at number 6 on Billboard (magazine) Billboard top comedy albums.
It also received a 56th Annual Grammy Awards 2014 Grammy Award nomination for Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album Best Comedy Album.
Ferguson was awarded the Peter Ustinov Comedy Award by the Banff World Media Festival on 11 June 2013.
===The Late Late Show===
<!-- This section should be short; details belong in the shows article -->
{{Main article The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson}}
In December 2004, it was announced that Ferguson would be the successor to Craig Kilborn on CBSs The Late Late Show. His first show as the regular host aired on 3 January 2005. By May 2008, Ben Alba, an American television historian and an authority on US talk shows, said Ferguson "has already made his mark, taking the TV monologue to new levels with an underlying story.  But he is only just starting ... He is making up his own rules: Its the immigrant experience."
The show was unique in that it had no "human" sidekicks such as Ed McMahon on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson or Conan OBriens Andy Richter.
He had a remotely operated robot skeleton named Geoff Peterson and two silent performers in a pantomime horse costume that were added in 2010. His monologues were conducted within a few feet of the camera versus the long distance that Johnny Carson kept from the camera and audience.
The Late Late Show averaged 2.0 million viewers in its 2007 season, compared with 2.5 million for Late Night with Conan OBrien.
In April 2008, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson beat Late Night with Conan OBrien for weekly ratings (1.88 million to 1.77 million) for the first time since the two shows went head-to-head with their respective hosts.
By the end of 2009, Craig Ferguson topped Jimmy Fallon in the ratings with Ferguson getting a 1.8 rating/6 share and Fallon receiving a 1.6 rating/6 share.{{jargon-inline date=July 2018}}

On 28 April 2014, Ferguson announced he would be leaving The Late Late Show at the end of 2014,
with the final episode airing on 19 December.
His contract was set to expire in June 2014, but a six-month extension was agreed on to provide a more graceful exit and give CBS more time to find a replacement host.
He reportedly received {{US$ 5 million}} as part of his contract because he was not selected as the replacement for David Lettermans Late Show.
Ferguson made the decision prior to Lettermans announcement but agreed to delay making his own decision public until the reaction to Lettermans decision had died down.
CBS Entertainment Chair Nina Tassler said, following the announcement, that in his decade as host Ferguson had "infused the broadcast with tremendous energy, unique comedy, insightful interviews and some of the most heartfelt monologues seen on television."
CBS continued the franchise with James Corden as the new host.
