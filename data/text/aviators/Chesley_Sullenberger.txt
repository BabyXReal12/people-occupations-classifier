Sullenberger said later: "It was very quiet as we worked, my copilot Jeff Skiles and I. We were a team.

The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that Sullenberger made the correct decision in landing on the river instead of attempting a return to LaGuardia<ref>Dodd, Johnny (September 19, 2016). "After the Miracle", People (magazine) People, pp 87-88.</ref> because the normal procedures for engine loss are designed for cruising altitudes, not immediately after takeoff. Simulations showed that Flight 1549 could have barely made it back to LaGuardia had that maneuver begun immediately after the bird strike, but this scenario completely neglects the time needed to understand what had happened and assess the situation.<ref>Paur, Jason (May 5, 2010).
