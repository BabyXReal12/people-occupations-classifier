At 14, she enrolled in a flying club. She performed her first solo flight at 15, and later graduated at Kherson military flying school. She became a flight instructor at Tver Kalinin Airclub,<ref name="Seidl p. 134.">Seidl 1998, p. 134.</ref> and by the time the German-Soviet war broke out, had already trained 45 pilots.<ref name="Cottam-Selected-Biographies p. 149.">Cottam-Selected-Biographies 1998, p. 149.</ref>

==World War II==

===Womens regiment===
After the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, Litvyak tried to join a military aviation unit, but was turned down for lack of experience. After deliberately exaggerating her pre-war flight time by 100 hours, she joined the all-female 586th Fighter Regiment of the Air Defense Force (586 IAP/PVO,  istrebitelnaia aviatsia protivovozdushnoi oborony),<ref name="Pennington p. XV.">Pennington 2001, p. XV.</ref> which was formed by Marina Raskova. She trained there on the Yakovlev Yak-1 aircraft.

===Mens regiment===
Litvyak flew her first combat flights in the summer of 1942 over Saratov. In September, she was assigned to the 437 IAP, a mens regiment fighting over Stalingrad. On 10 September she moved along with Katya Budanova, Maria M. Kuznetsova and Raisa Beliaeva, the commander of the group, and accompanying female ground crew, to the regiment airfield, at Verkhnaia Akhtuba, on the east bank of the Volga river. But when they arrived the base was empty and under attack, so they soon moved to Srednaia Akhtuba.<ref name="Pennington pp. 130-131.">Pennington 2001, pp. 130-131.</ref> Here, flying a Yak-1<ref name="Polak p. 202.">Polak 1999, p. 202.</ref> carrying the number "32" on the fuselage, she would achieve considerable success.<ref name="Polak p. 201.">Polak 1999, p. 201.</ref> Boris Eremin (later lieutenant general of aviation), a commander regimental commander in the Division (military) division to which she and Budanova were assigned, saw her as "a very aggressive person" and "a born fighter pilot".<ref name="Pennington p. 163.">Pennington 1997, p. 163.</ref>

In the 437th Fighter Regiment, Litvyak scored her first two kills on 13 September, three days after her arrival and on her third mission to cover Stalingrad, becoming the first woman fighter pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft.<ref name="Cottam-Selected-Biographies p. 150.">Cottam-Selected-Biographies 1998, p. 150.</ref> That day, four Yak-1s—with Major S.

Maier parachuted from his aircraft, was captured by Soviet troops, and asked to see the Russian ace who had outflown him. When he was taken to Litvyak, he thought he was being made the butt of a Soviet joke. It was not until Litvyak described each move of the fight to him in perfect detail that he knew he had been shot down by a woman pilot.<ref name="Goodpaster p. 27."/>
But according to other authors,<ref name="Bergström p. 83.">Bergström 2007, p. 83.</ref> the first air victory by a female pilot was achieved by  586° IAPs Lieutenant Valeriya Khomiakova when she shot down  the Ju 88 flown by  Oblt.

===Free hunter===
Litvyak, Beliaeva, Budanova and Kuznetsova stayed in the 437 IAP for a short time only, mainly because it was equipped with Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3 LaGG 3s rather than Yak-1s, that the women flew, and was lacking the facilities to service the latter. So the four women were moved to the 9th Guards (Russia) Guards Fighter Regiment (9 GvIAP, gvardeiskii istrebitel’ nyi aviatsionnyi polk). From October 1942 till January 1943, Litvyak and Budanova served, still in the Stalingrad area, with this famous unit, commanded by Lev Shestakov, Hero of Soviet Union.<ref name="Cottam-Selected-Biographies p. 150."/>

In January 1943, the 9th was re-equipped with the Bell P-39 Airacobras  and Litvyak and Budanova were moved to the 296 IAP (later the 73 GvIAP, Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment) of Nikolai Baranov, of the 8th Air Army, so that they could still fly the Yaks.<ref name="Pennington pp. 135-163.">Pennington 2001, pp. 135-163.</ref> On February 23, she was awarded the Order of the Red Star, made a second lieutenant junior lieutenant and selected to take part in the elite air tactic called okhotniki, or "free hunter", where pairs of experienced pilots searched for targets on their own initiative.<ref name="Pennington1997"/> Twice, she was forced to land due to battle damage. On 22 March she was wounded for the first time.<ref name="Cottam-Selected-Biographies p. 152.">Cottam-Selected-Biographies 1998, p. 152.</ref> That day she was flying as part of a group of six Yak fighters when they attacked a dozen Ju 88s. Litvyak shot down one of the bombers but was in turn attacked and wounded by the escorting Bf 109s. She managed to shoot down a Messerschmitt and to return to her airfield and land her plane, but was in severe pain and losing blood.<ref name="Pennington pp. 137-138.">Pennington 2001, pp. 137-138.</ref>
While in 73 GvIAP, she often flew as wingman of Kapitan Aleksey Frolovich Solomatin a flying ace. He had claimed  a total of 39 victories (22 shared), when he flew into the ground, in Pavlonka, and was killed in front of the entire regiment on May 21,<ref name="Polak p. 302.">Polak 1999, p. 302.</ref> while training a new flyer. Litvyak was devastated by the crash and wrote a letter to her mother describing how she realized only after Solomatins death that she had loved him.<ref name="Pennington1997">Pennington, 1997</ref>

Senior Sergeant Inna Pasportnikova, Litvyaks mechanic during the time she flew with the mens regiment, reported in 1990 that after Solomatins death, Litvyak wanted nothing but to fly combat missions, and she fought desperately.<ref name="Noggle p.198">Noggle, 1994, p. 198</ref>

Litvyak scored against a difficult target on May 31, 1943: an Observation balloon artillery observation balloon manned by a German officer. German artillery was aided in targeting by reports from the observation post on the balloon. The elimination of the balloon had been attempted by other Soviet airmen but all had been driven away by a dense protective belt of anti-aircraft fire defending the balloon. Litvyak volunteered to take out the balloon but was turned down. She insisted and described for her commander her plan: she would attack it from the rear after flying in a wide circle around the perimeter of the battleground and over German-held territory. The tactic worked—the hydrogen-filled balloon caught fire under her stream of Tracer ammunition tracer bullets and was destroyed.<ref>Noggle, 1994, pp. 197–198.</ref>

On June 13, 1943, Litvyak was appointed flight commander of the 3rd Aviation Squadron within 73rd GvIAP.<ref name="Pennington1997"/>

Litvyak made an additional kill on July 16, 1943.<ref name="Sakaida p. 15.">Sakaida 2003, p. 15.</ref><ref name="Pennington (Amazons) p. 264.">Pennington (Amazons) 2003, p. 264.</ref> That day, six Yaks encountered 30 German Ju-88 bombers with six escorts.

She shot down one Bf 109 on 19 July 1943, probably 6-kill ace Uffz.

=== Last mission ===
File:Krasnyi Luch Wall.jpg thumb Krasnyi Luch wall of Honor to the Heroes of War and Labor. Litvyak took off for her last mission from an airfield close to this city, where a museum dedicated to her is located.
On August 1, 1943, Litvyak did not come back to her base at Krasnyy Luch. It was her fourth sortie of the day, escorting a flight of Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmoviks. As the Soviets were returning to base near Orel,<ref name="Spick p. 120."/> a pair of Bf 109 fighters<ref name="Noggle p.198"/> dived on Litvyak while she was attacking a large group of German bombers. Soviet pilot Ivan Borisenko recalled: “Lily just didn’t see the Messerschmitt 109s flying cover for the German bombers. A pair of them dived on her and when she did see them she turned to meet them. Then they all disappeared behind a cloud.” Borisenko, involved in the dogfight, saw her the last time, through a gap in the clouds, her Yak-1 pouring smoke and pursued by as many as eight Bf 109s.<ref name="Myles p. 232.">Myles 1981, p. 232.</ref>

Borisenko descended to see if he could find her. No parachute was seen, and no explosion, yet she never returned from the mission. Litvyak was 21 years old. Soviet authorities suspected that she might have been captured, a possibility that prevented them from awarding her the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.<ref name=Noggle199>Noggle, 1994, p. 199</ref>

Two German pilots are believed to have shot down Litvyak: Iron Cross holder and 30-kill experte Fw. Hans-Jörg Merkle of 1./JG.52, Knights Cross holder and future 99-kill experte Lt, or Hans Schleef, of 7./JG 3. Merkle is the only pilot that claimed a Yak-1 near Dmitryevka on 1 August 1943, his 30th victory.  (Dmitrijewka is where she was last seen and was – reportedly – buried.) This occurred before being rammed and killed by his own victim (Luftwaffe combat report of collision: 3&nbsp;km east of Dmitrijewka).  While Schleef claimed a LaGG-3 (often confused in combat with Yak-1s by German pilots) kill on the same day, in the South-Ukraine area where Litvyaks aircraft was at last found.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.aircrewremembered.com/KrackerDatabase/?q=Merkle+Hans title=Fw.

==Recognition and controversy==
In an attempt to prove that Litvyak had not been taken captive, Pasportnikova embarked on a 36-year search for the Yakovlev Yak-1 crash site assisted by the public and the media. For three years she was joined by relatives who together combed the most likely areas with a metal detector.<ref name=Noggle199/> In 1979, after uncovering more than 90 other crash sites, 30 aircraft<ref name=Noggle199/> and many lost pilots killed in action, "the searchers discovered that an unidentified woman pilot had been buried in the village of Dmitrievka... in Shakhterski district." It was then assumed that it was Litvyak and that she had been killed in action after sustaining a mortal head wound.<ref name="Pennington1997"/> Pasportnikova said that a special commission was formed to inspect the exhumed body and it concluded the remains were those of Litvyak.<ref name="Noggle p. 200.">Noggle 1994, p. 200.</ref>

On May 6, 1990, USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev posthumously awarded Litvyak Hero of the Soviet Union.<ref>Noggle, 1994, pp. 158, 194.</ref> Her final rank was senior lieutenant, as documented in all Moscow newspapers of that date.

===Death controversy===
Arguments have been published that dispute the official version of Litvyaks death. Although Yekaterina Valentina Vaschenko, the curator of the Litvyak museum in Krasnyi Luch has stated that the body was disinterred and examined by forensic specialists, who determined that it was indeed Litvyak,<ref>Soviet-Awards.com Henry Sakaida, 2002. [http://soviet-awards.com/digest/litvyak/litvyak3.htm The Memorial to Soviet Ace Lydia Litvyak, page 3.] Retrieved on March 23, 2009.</ref> Kazimiera Janina "Jean" Cottam claims, on the basis of evidence provided by Ekaterina Polunina, chief mechanic and archivist of the 586th Fighter Regiment in which Litvyak initially served, that the body was never exhumed and that verification was limited to comparison of a number of reports.<ref name="Cottam2006">Redarmyonline.org. Kazimiera Janina "Jean" Cottam, 2006. ([http://www.redarmyonline.org/FI_Article_by_KJ_Cottam.html Lidya (Lily) Vladimirovna Litvyak (b. 1921).] Retrieved March 23, 2009.</ref> Cottam, an author and researcher focusing on Soviet women in the military, concludes that Litvyak made a belly-landing in her stricken aircraft, was captured and taken to a prisoner of war camp.<ref name="Cottam2006"/> In her book published in 2004, Polunina lists evidence that led her to conclude that Litvyak was pulled from the downed aircraft by German troops and held prisoner for some time.<ref name=Polunina>Polunina, 2004</ref>

Gian Piero Milanetti, author of a recent book about Soviet aviatrixes,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.aviolibri.it/prodotti/9308_milanetti_soviet_air_women_of_the_great_patriotic_war_a_pictorial_history.php?page=9&ordina= title=AVIOLIBRI - Soviet Air Women of the Great Patriotic war. A pictorial history publisher= accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref> wrote that an airwoman parachuted in the approximate location of the alleged crash landing of Litvyaks aircraft. No other Soviet airwomen operated in that area, so Milanetti believes the pilot was Litvyak, probably captured by the enemy.

A television broadcast from Switzerland was seen in 2000 by Nina Raspopova Raspopova, a veteran of the womens night bomber regiment. It featured a former Soviet woman fighter pilot who Raspopova thought may have been Litvyak. This veteran was wounded twice. Married outside of the Soviet Union, she had three children. Raspopova promptly told Polunina what she inferred from the Swiss broadcast.<ref name=Polunina/>

===Validity of number of kills===
There are conflicting claims about Litvyaks victory score in different publications; none are official records. Most often, 11 individual kills and 3 team kills are quoted, but also eight individual and four team, 12 individual and two team,<ref name=Noggle157>Noggle, 1994, p. 157.</ref> or other combinations. Pasportnikova stated in 1990 that the tally was 12 solo kills including the balloon, and three shared.<ref>Noggle, 1994, p. 197.</ref> Polunina has written that the kills of top-scoring Soviet pilots, including those of Litvyak and Budanova, were often inflated; and that Litvyak should be credited with five solo aircraft kills and two group kills, including the observation balloon.<ref name=Polunina/>

Litvyak was awarded the Order of the Red Banner, Order of the Red Star, and was twice honored with the Order of the Patriotic War.

==Character and private life==
Litvyak displayed a rebellious and romantic character.<ref name="Milanetti">{{cite book  last=Milanetti  first=Gian Piero  title=Le streghe della notte  trans-title=The Night Witches  edition=1st  date=April 2011  publisher=Istituto Bibliografico Napoleone  location=Rome  language=Italian  isbn=88-7565-100-0  pages=73–88}}</ref> Returning from a successful mission, she would "buzz" the aerodrome and then indulge in unauthorised aerobatics, knowing that it enraged her commander.

Litvyak could also be superstitious, as Paspotnikova testified:
<blockquote>
She never believed that she was invincible. She believed that some pilots had luck on their side and others didnt. She firmly believed that, if you survived the first missions, the more you flew and the more experience you got your chances of making it would increase. But you had to have luck on your side.<ref>Milanetti, 2011, p.79</ref>
</blockquote>

Despite the predominantly male environment in which she found herself, she never renounced her femininity, and would carry on dyeing her hair blonde, sending her friend Inna Pasportnikova to the hospital to fetch hydrogen peroxide for her.<ref name="Milanetti"/> She would fashion scarves from parachute material, dyeing the small pieces in different colors and stitching them together and would not hide her love of flowers, which she picked at every available occasion, favoring red roses. She would make bouquets and keep them in the cockpit, which were promptly discarded by the male pilots who shared her aircraft.<ref>Milanetti, 2011, p.80</ref>

Her comrade Solomatin is believed to have been her fiancé, and after his death, she wrote to her mother:
<blockquote>
You see, he was not my type, but his insistence and his love for me convinced me to love him... and now, it seems I will never meet someone like him ever again.<ref name="Milanetti"/>
</blockquote>

The novel Vernis iz Poleta<ref>[http://openlibrary.org/b/OL4050426M/Vernisʹ_iz_poletathat Return from the flight]</ref> ("Return from Flight") by  Natalya Myeklin Natalya Kravtsova fictionalizes the death of Solomatin, stating that he was killed when he ran out of ammunition while battling with a German Bf 109 fighter plane over his own airfield. In this version, Litvyak and others at the airfield watched the fight and witnessed his death.

Litvyak was called the "White Lily of Stalingrad" in Soviet press releases; the white lily flower may be translated from Russian as Madonna lily. She has also been called the "White Rose of Stalingrad" in Europe and North America since reports of her exploits were first published in English.<ref>{{cite web title=Who was the White Rose of Stalingrad? url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/0/21329663 publisher=BBC History}}</ref>

==Depictions in fiction==

Litvyak is the major character in Mary Ann Cooks romanticized novel The White Rose, a fictional account of her wartime experiences.<ref>Cook, Mary Ann (2012) The White Rose, {{ISBN 978-0-9886323-3-2}}</ref>

A heavily fictionalized Litvyak (called Natasha in the book) is the main character of Belinda Alexandras novel "Sapphire Skies" <ref>{{cite web url=http://www.harpercollins.com.au/books/Sapphire-Skies-Belinda-Alexandra/?isbn=9781743099117 title=Sapphire Skies author=World Archipelago work=HarperCollins AUS accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref>

Perhaps the most detailed work of literary fiction about Litvyak, her life, times and loves, was written by an American, M.G. Crisci, with no Russian ancestry, in cooperation with Valentina Vaschenko, the curator of the Lilya Litvyak Museum and School in Krasny Luch, Eastern Ukraine. The book entitled "Call Sign, White Lily," <ref>{{ISBN 978-0-9663360-3-0}}</ref> also contains never-before-seen photographs contributed by the museum.

===Stage play===
The play White Rose by Scottish playwright Peter Arnott (playwright) Peter Arnott portrays Litvyaks imagined political thoughts, with her character discussing war and Soviet womens resistance against Nazism. It was first performed on 22 May 1985 at the Edinburgh Festival, in the Traverse Theatre. Ken Stott and Tilda Swinton played the lead characters; the role helped advance Swintons career. Swinton met her future husband John Byrne (playwright) John Byrne during the production. Byrne, also a playwright, served as the set designer for White Rose.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.traverse.co.uk/writing/artists-in-residence/peter-arnott/  title=Peter Arnott  work=Artists-in-residence  publisher=Traverse Theatre  accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.theatrescotland.com/email/update.html  title=Playwrights in agreement shock  work=Weekly Update  date=12 March 2010  publisher=TheatreScotland.com  accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/michaelwalford/entry/tilda_swinton_/  last=Walford  first=Michael  work=Kinoeye  title=Tilda Swinton (1960–)  date=17 August 2008  accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref>
