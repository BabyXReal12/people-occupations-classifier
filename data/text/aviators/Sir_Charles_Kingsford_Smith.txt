==1928 Trans-Tasman flight==
After making the first non-stop flight across Australia from Point Cook near Melbourne to Perth, Western Australia Perth in Western Australia in August 1928, Kingsford Smith and Ulm registered themselves as Australian National Airways (see below). They then decided to attempt the Tasman Sea crossing  to New Zealand not only because it had not yet been done, but also in the hope the Australian Government would grant Australian National Airways a subsidised contract to carry scheduled mail regularly.<ref name = "Davis">Pedr Davis Davis, P., 1977, Charles Kingsford Smith: Smithy, the Worlds Greatest Aviator, Summit Books, {{ISBN 0-7271-0144-7}}</ref>  The Tasman had remained unflown after the failure of the first attempt in January 1928, when New Zealanders Moncrieff and Hood John Moncrieff and George Hood had List of aerial disappearances vanished without trace.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8915725/Lost-in-the-long-white-cloud  title=Lost in the long white cloud  first=Charles  last=Anderson  date=14 July 2013  work=Stuff.co.nz  accessdate=8 June 2018}}</ref>

Kingsford Smiths flight was planned for take off from Richmond, New South Wales Richmond, near Sydney, on Sunday 2 September 1928, with a scheduled landing around 9:00&nbsp;a.m. on 3 September at Wigram Aerodrome, near Christchurch, the principal city in the South Island of New Zealand.

The mayor of Christchurch supported the churchmen and cabled a protest to Kingsford Smith. As it happened, unfavourable weather developed over the Tasman and the flight was deferred, so it is not known whether or how Kingsford Smith would have heeded the cable.<ref name="Davis" />

Accompanied by Ulm, navigator Harold Arthur Litchfield, and radio operator Thomas H.

The {{convert 2600 km}} planned route was only just over half the distance between Hawaii and Fiji. After a stormy flight, at times through Atmospheric icing icing conditions, the Southern Cross made landfall in much improved weather near Cook Strait, the passage between New Zealands two main islands.

The pair, Keith Vincent Anderson and Henry Smith "Bobby" Hitchcock, had been flying a Westland Widgeon (fixed wing) Westland Widgeon plane named Kookaburra (aeroplane) Kookaburra. Many sections of the media and public felt that the forced landing of the Southern Cross, which was dubbed the "Coffee Royal" incident after the brew of coffee and brandy which the crew had drunk while awaiting rescue, had been a publicity stunt and that Kingsford Smith was responsible for the two deaths.

==A personal memorial==
Australian aviation enthusiast Austin Byrne was part of the large crowd at Sydneys Mascot Aerodrome in June 1928 to welcome the Southern Cross and its crew following their successful trans-Pacific flight. Witnessing this event inspired Byrne to make a scale model of the Southern Cross to give to Kingsford Smith. After the aviators disappearance, Byrne continued to expand and enhance his tribute with paintings, photographs, documents, and artworks he created, designed or commissioned. Between 1930 and his death in 1993, Byrne devoted his life to creating and touring his Southern Cross Memorial.<ref>[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/highlights/austin_byrne_southern_cross_memorial_collection Austin Byrne Southern Cross Memorial collection highlight: National Museum of Australia] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828041858/http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/highlights/austin_byrne_southern_cross_memorial_collection  date=28 August 2013 }}</ref>
