==Early life and education==
Robertson was born in La Jolla, California,
the son of Clifford Parker Robertson Jr. (1902–1968), and his first wife, Audrey Olga Robertson (née Willingham; 1903–1925).
His Texas-born father was described as "the idle heir to a tidy sum of ranching money".
Robertson once said, "[My father] was a very romantic figure – tall, handsome. He married four or five times, and between marriages hed pop in to see me. He was a great raconteur, and he was always surrounded by psychopaths who let him pick up the tab. During the Depression, he tapped the trust for $500,000, and six months later he was back for more."
Robertsons parents divorced when he was one, and his mother died of peritonitis a year later in El Paso, Texas, at the age of 21.
