==Political career==
Hyer began his professional political career in 2003. In the 2004 election, Hyer almost doubled the vote share received by the NDP and advanced their standing to second place. In the following election in 2006, Hyer came even closer, falling short of the Liberal incumbent Joe Comuzzi by only 408 votes. In 2008, Hyer was elected to the 40th Canadian Parliament with a 9% lead over the Liberals.

===First term===

After taking his seat in October, 2008, Hyer started work on climate change legislation. On February 10, 2009, Hyer tabled Bill C-311<ref>Climate Change Accountability Act http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=E&query=6747&Session=23&List=toc</ref> the Climate Change Accountability Act (Bill C-311) as his first private members bill in the House of Commons of Canada. The bill was passed by the House of Commons in a minority Conservative government at 3rd Reading on May 5, 2010 with 149 votes for and 136 votes against.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Doc=40&Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=40&Pub=Hansard&Ses=3#SOB-3144365  title=Official Report * Table of Contents * Number 040 (Official Version)  publisher=Parl.gc.ca  date=  accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref> It was defeated on November 16, 2010 by a vote of 43 to 32 in the Conservative-controlled Senate; to date, this remains the only bill in Canadas parliamentary history to be passed in the House of Commons, only to be defeated in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Chamber/403/Debates/065db_2010-11-16-E.htm?Language=E&Parl=40&Ses=3#43  title=Debates - Issue 65 - November 16, 2010  publisher=Parl.gc.ca  date=  accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://brucehyer.ca/meet-bruce  title=Meet Bruce Hyer  publisher=Brucehyer.ca  date=  accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref> Other bills Hyer has introduced include Bill C-312 the Made in Canada Act,<ref>Made in Canada Act http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=E&query=5716&Session=22&List=toc</ref> the Cell Phone Freedom Act<ref>Cell Phone Freedom Act http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=4640240&file=4</ref> and a number of motions including the Northwest Ontario Passenger Rail Motion,<ref>Northwest Ontario passenger Rail Motion {{cite web url=http://www.ReviveSuperiorRail.ca/  title=Archived copy  accessdate=2010-06-22  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706202217/http://www.revivesuperiorrail.ca/  archivedate=2011-07-06  df= }}</ref> which mandates the return of Via Rail service to the north shore of Lake Superior and to Thunder Bay. Hyer served as the NDPs small business and tourism critic from 2008 to 2011.

===Second term===
In the Canadian federal election, 2011 2011 election, Hyer was re-elected with 49.8% of the vote, 7,000 votes more than his nearest opponent. Following his re-election, the issue of the long gun registry was tabled in the House of Commons. As he had promised voters over four elections, Hyer voted in favour of ending the registration of hunting rifles and shotguns, given that all legal firearm owners were already licensed and registered themselves under the Possession and Acquisition Licence (PAL). This move was viewed unfavourably within the NDP, even though firearm registration was not mentioned in party policies or platforms.  As a result of his decision, Hyer was stripped of his critic roles, barred from international travel on House business and was no longer given the opportunity to speak in the House. On April 23, 2012 Hyer announced he would sit as an Independent (politician) independent, which he remained for a year and a half.<ref>{{cite news title=Bruce Hyer quits NDP caucus to sit as an Independent url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bruce-hyer-quits-ndp-caucus-to-sit-as-an-independent-1.1170157 publisher=CBC News accessdate=May 29, 2018 date=April 23, 2012}}</ref>

===Green Party===
On December 13, 2013, Hyer announced that he would join the Green Party of Canada, doubling the number of members the party has in the House of Commons by joining the leader of the party, Elizabeth May.<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/thunder-bay-mp-bruce-hyer-joins-green-party-doubles-caucus-1.2462983 title=Thunder Bay MP Bruce Hyer joins Green Party, doubles caucus date=December 13, 2013 accessdate=December 13, 2013 publisher=CBC News}}</ref> Hyer gave as reasoning for his decision that: the Green Party has the best leader and platform; and that they are the only party in Parliament that is truly democratic, allowing Green MPs to put their constituents and conscience before party control. One year later, on December 13, 2014, Hyer was acclaimed as the Green Party candidate for the Thunder Bay—Superior North riding in the Canadian federal election, 2015 2015 election. On October 19, 2015, he lost the election to Liberal Party candidate Patty Hajdu, getting only 13.8% of the votes.
