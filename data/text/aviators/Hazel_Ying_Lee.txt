==Early life==
Lee was born in Portland, Oregon. Her parents were Yuet Lee and Ssiu Lan Wong from Taishan, Guangdong. Her father was a merchant. Her mother devoted her energy to raising eight children and helping with the family business. Despite the widespread anti-Chinese bias of her time, Lee led a full and active life. Lee swam, played Team handball handball, loved to play cards and, in her teenage years, learned how to drive.<ref name="Flaccus">{{cite news last1=Flaccus first1=Gillian title=Chinese American WASP Losing Her Anonymity url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/may/11/news/adna-pilot11 accessdate=30 January 2018 work=Los Angeles Times date=11 May 2003}}</ref> Following graduation from high school in 1929, Lee found a job as an elevator operator at Liebes Department Store in downtown Portland.

In 1932, Lee took her first airplane ride with a friend at an air show.<ref name="Documentary"/> At a time when less than 1% of pilots in the U.S. were women, Lee joined the Chinese Flying Club of Portland and took flying lessons with famed aviator Al Greenwood.<ref name="Unander">{{cite journal last1=Unander first1=Lee Sig title=Skys the Limit journal=1859 Oregons Magazine date=November 10, 2016 url=https://1859oregonmagazine.com/think-oregon/art-culture/hazel-lee/ accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> Despite opposition from her mother, Lee "had to fly."<ref name="Flaccus"/> In discussing Lees love of flying her sister Frances said,  "It was the thought of doing something she loved. Lee enjoyed the danger and doing something that was new to Chinese girls."
In October 1932 Lee became one of the first Chinese-American women to earn a pilots license.<ref name="Unander"/> In speaking of Lee and the handful of other Chinese-American women pilots of that time, author Judy Yung has written "Although few in number, these first Chinese American aviators, in their attempt to participate in a daring sport, broke the stereotype of the passive Chinese women and demonstrated the ability of Chinese American women to compete in a male dominated field." While in Portland, Lee met her future husband "Clifford" Louie Yim-qun.

===Time in China===
In response to Japanese invasion of Manchuria Japanese invasion of China in 1933, Lee journeyed to China with the goal of joining the Chinese Air Force.<ref name="NBC">{{cite news last1=Gandhi first1=Lakshmi title=Remembering Hazel Lee, the first Chinese-American female military pilot url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/remembering-hazel-lee-first-chinese-american-female-military-pilot-n745851 accessdate=29 January 2018 publisher=NBC News date=May 25, 2017}}</ref> Despite the need for pilots the Republic of China Air Force would not accept a woman pilot.<ref name="Oregon">{{cite web title=Hazel Ying Lee (1912-1944) url=https://oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/lee_hazel_ying/#.Wm5Eha6nGos website=oregonencyclopedia.org accessdate=28 January 2018 language=en}}</ref> Frustrated, Lee instead settled in Guangzhou Canton and spent the next few years flying for a private airline.

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, America was drawn into World War II. As the war claimed the time and lives of American pilots, it became clear that there were not enough male pilots to sustain the war effort at home. With the ambivalent support of Army Air Force Commander Henry H. Arnold Henry "Hap" Arnold, the Women Airforce Service Pilots or "WASP," was created in 1943, under the command of famed aviator Jacqueline Cochran.

Experienced women pilots, like Lee, were eager to join the WASP, and responded to interview requests by Cochran. Members of the WASP reported to Avenger Field, in Sweetwater, Texas for an arduous six-month training program. Lee was accepted into the 4th class, 43 W 4.<ref>{{cite web title=Women Airforce Service Pilots: Hazel Ah Ying Lee url=http://www.twu.edu/library/wasp/wasppdf/Lee.pdf publisher=Texas Womens University}}</ref> Hazel Ying Lee was the first Chinese-American woman to fly for the United States military.<ref name="NBC"/> During Hazels training it was reported that she fell from the aircraft she was riding in when the instructor made an unexpected Aerobatic maneuver loop.

They delivered aircraft, being manufactured in large numbers in converted automobile factories, to points of embarkation, where they would then be shipped to the European and Pacific war fronts. In a letter to her sister, Lee described Romulus as "a 7-day workweek, with little time off."<ref name="Flaccus"/> When asked to describe Lees attitude, a fellow member of the WASP summed it up in Lees own words, "Ill take and deliver anything." Lee was described by her fellow pilots as "calm and fearless" even during forced landings. One emergency landing took place at a wheat field in Kansas. A farmer, armed with a pitchfork, chased Lee around her plane as he was shouting to his neighbors that the Japanese had invaded Kansas.

Lee was in demand when a mission was RON (Remaining Overnight). In a big city or in a small country town, she could always find a Chinese restaurant, supervise the menu, and often cook the food herself. She was a great cook. Fellow WASP pilot Sylvia Dahmes Clayton observed that "Hazel provided me with an opportunity to learn about a different culture at a time when I did not know anything else. She expanded my world and my outlook on life."<ref name="Heishman"/> In September 1944, Lee was sent to Pursuit School at Brownsville, Texas for intensive training.<ref name="Oregon"/> She was part of Class 44-18 Flight B and went on to be among the 134 women pilots who flew "Pursuit," that is faster, high powered fighters such as the P-63 Kingcobra, P-51 Mustang and P-39 Airacobra with Lees favorite being the Mustang.<ref>{{cite web title=Hazel Ying Lee url=https://www.wai.org/pioneers/2011/hazel-ying-lee website=Women in Aviation International accessdate=31 January 2018 language=en}}</ref> Lee and the others were the first women to pilot fighter aircraft for the United States military.

===Death===
On November 10, 1944 Lee received orders to go to the Bell Aircraft factory at Niagara Falls, New York where she was to fly a P-63 Kingcobra aircraft to Great Falls, Montana. During the War Lee and the other Pursuit pilots delivered over 5,000 fighters to Great Falls which was a link in supplying Soviet allies with planes under the Lend-Lease program.<ref name="Merry"/> From there male pilots flew the fighters on to Alaska where Soviet pilots waited to fly the planes to their home bases. Bad weather delayed the mission at Fargo, North Dakota and on Thanksgiving morning the weather cleared allowing Lee to leave Fargo.<ref>{{cite news last1=Venugopal first1=Anjana title=Badass Ladies of China: Hazel Ying Lee publisher=The World of Chinese url=http://www.theworldofchinese.com/2016/04/badass-ladies-hazel-ying-lee/ accessdate=31 January 2018 work=www.theworldofchinese.com date=April 14, 2016 language=en}}</ref> A little after 2 p.m. Lee was cleared to land in Great Falls with a large number of P-63s approached the airport at the same time. There was confusion on the part of the control tower and Lees plane and another P-63 collided. The aircraft were engulfed in flames and Lee was pulled from the burning wreckage of her airplane with her flight jacket still smoldering.<ref name="Merry"/> 

Two days later, on November 25, 1944, Lee died from the burns she received in the accident. Only three days after learning of Lees death the Lee family received another telegram informing them that Lees brother Victor, who was serving with the U.S. Tank Corps, had been killed in combat in France.<ref name="Oregon"/> As they prepared to bury Hazel and Victor, the family picked out a burial site in a Portland, Oregon cemetery.<ref name="burial">{{cite web title=Hazel Ying Lee: Fighting for Gender Equality url=http://www.ncdemocracy.org/sites/www.ncdemocracy.org/files/docs/FFD_EducGuide_10_Hazel_0.pdf publisher=National Center for the Preservation of Democracy}}</ref> The cemetery refused to allow the family to bury Hazel and Victor in the chosen spot, citing cemetery policy that did not allow Asians to be buried "in the White section."<ref name="Documentary"/> After a lengthy battle, the Lee family prevailed. Lee was laid to rest in a non-military funeral, and buried alongside her brother, on a sloping hill in River View Cemetery (Portland, Oregon) River View Cemetery,<ref name="burial"/> overlooking the Willamette River.

For over three decades, members of the WASP and their supporters attempted to secure military status for the women pilots.<ref name="Collins"/> In March 1977, following United States Congressional approval of Public Law 95-202, the efforts of the Women Airforce Service pilots were finally recognized and military status was finally granted.<ref name="Collins">{{cite news last1=Collins first1=Shannon title=WASP Pursued Love of Flying, Fought for Women Vets’ Recognition url=https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/689318/wasp-pursued-love-of-flying-fought-for-women-vets-recognition/ accessdate=28 January 2018 publisher=U.S. Department of Defense date=March 9, 2016}}</ref> Thirty-eight pilots of the WASP died while in service to their country during the difficult years of World War II and Lee was the last to die during the program.
