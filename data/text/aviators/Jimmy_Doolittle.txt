James Harold Doolittle (December 14, 1896 – September 27, 1993) was an American List of aviation pioneers aviation pioneer. A United States Army Reserve Reserve officer in the United States Army Air Corps, Doolittle was recalled to active duty during World War II. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for personal valor and leadership as commander of the Doolittle Raid, a bold long-range retaliatory Strategic bombing air raid on the Empire of Japan Japanese main islands, on April 18, 1942, four months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The attack was a major morale booster for the United States, and Doolittle was celebrated as a hero. He was eventually promoted to Lieutenant general (United States) lieutenant general and commanded the Twelfth Air Force over North Africa, the Fifteenth Air Force over the Mediterranean, and the Eighth Air Force over Europe.

==Early life and education==
Doolittle was born in Alameda, California, and spent his youth in Nome, Alaska, where he earned a reputation as a boxer.
His parents were Frank Henry Doolittle and Rosa (Rose) Cerenah Shephard. By 1910, Jimmy Doolittle was attending school in Los Angeles. When his school attended the 1910 Los Angeles International Air Meet at Dominguez Field, Doolittle saw his first airplane.<ref name="Berliner 2009, p. 37">Berliner 2009, p. 37.</ref> He attended Los Angeles City College after graduating from Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles, and later won admission to the University of California, Berkeley where he studied in The School of Mines. He was a member of Theta Kappa Nu fraternity, which would merger merge into Lambda Chi Alpha during the latter stages of the Great Depression.

Doolittle took a leave of absence in October 1917 to enlist in the Signal Corps (United States Army) Signal Corps Reserve as a flying cadet; he ground trained at the School of Military Aeronautics (an Army school) on the campus of the University of California, and flight-trained at Rockwell Field, California. Doolittle received his U.S. Air Force Aeronautical Ratings Reserve Military Aviator rating and was commissioned a first lieutenant in the Signal Officers Reserve Corps of the U.S. Army on March 11, 1918.

==Military career==
During World War I, Doolittle stayed in the United States as a flight instructor and performed his war service at Camp John Dick Aviation Concentration Center ("Camp Dick"), Texas; Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Wright Field, Ohio; Gerstner Field, Louisiana; Rockwell Field, California; Kelly Air Force Base Kelly Field, Texas and Eagle Pass, Texas.

Doolittles service at Rockwell Field consisted of duty as a flight leader and gunnery instructor. At Kelly Field, he served with the 104th Fighter Squadron 104th Aero Squadron and with the 90th Fighter Squadron 90th Aero Squadron of the 3d Operations Group 1st Surveillance Group. His detachment of the 90th Aero Squadron was based at Eagle Pass, Texas Eagle Pass, patrolling the Mexican border. Recommended by three officers for retention in the United States Army Air Service Air Service during demobilization at the end of the war, Doolittle qualified by examination and received a Regular Army commission as a 1st Lieutenant, Air Service, on July 1, 1920.

On May 10, 1921, he was engineering officer and pilot for an expedition recovering a plane that had force-landed in a Mexican canyon on February 10 during a transcontinental flight attempt by Alexander Pearson Jr. Lieut. Alexander Pearson. Doolittle reached the plane on May 3 and found it serviceable, then returned May 8 with a replacement motor and four mechanics. The oil pressure of the new motor was inadequate and Doolittle requested two pressure gauges, using carrier pigeons to communicate. The additional parts were dropped by air and installed, and Doolittle flew the plane to Del Rio, Texas himself, taking off from a 400-yard airstrip hacked out of the canyon floor.

Subsequently, he attended the Air Service Mechanical School at Kelly Field and the Aeronautical Engineering Course at McCook Field, Ohio. Having at last returned to complete his college degree, he earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of California, Berkeley in 1922, and joined the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.

Doolittle was one of the most famous pilots during the inter-war period. In September 1922, he made the first of many pioneering flights, flying a de Havilland DH-4 – which was equipped with early navigational instruments – in the first cross-country flight, from Pablo Beach (now Jacksonville Beach, Florida Jacksonville Beach), Florida, to Rockwell Field, San Diego, California, in 21 hours and 19 minutes, making only one refueling stop at Kelly Field. The U.S. Army awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross (U.S.) Distinguished Flying Cross.

Within days after the transcontinental flight, he was at the Air Service Engineering School (a precursor to the Air Force Institute of Technology) at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio. For Doolittle, the school assignment had special significance: "In the early 20s, there was not complete support between the flyers and the engineers. The pilots thought the engineers were a group of people who zipped slide rules back and forth, came out with erroneous results and bad aircraft; and the engineers thought the pilots were crazy – otherwise they wouldnt be pilots. So some of us who had previous engineering training were sent to the engineering school at old McCook Field. ... After a years training there in practical aeronautical engineering, some of us were sent on to MIT where we took advanced degrees in aeronautical engineering. I believe that the purpose was served, that there was thereafter a better understanding between pilots and engineers."

In July 1923, after serving as a test pilot and aeronautical engineer at McCook Field, Doolittle entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In March 1924, he conducted aircraft acceleration tests at McCook Field, which became the basis of his masters thesis and led to his second Distinguished Flying Cross. He received his Master of Science S.M. in Aeronautics from MIT in June 1924. Because the Army had given him two years to get his degree and he had done it in just one, he immediately started working on his Sc.D. in Aeronautics, which he received in June 1925. His doctorate in aeronautical engineering was the first ever issued in the United States.<ref>{{cite web last1=Quigley first1=Samantha L. title=Detroit Defied Reality to Help Win World War II url=https://www.uso.org/stories/112-detroit-defied-reality-to-help-win-world-war-ii website=United Service Organizations accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref> He said that he considered his masters work more significant than his doctorate.

Following graduation, Doolittle attended special training in high-speed seaplanes at Naval Support Facility Anacostia Naval Air Station Anacostia in Washington, D.C.. He also served with the Naval Test Board at Mitchel Field, Long Island, New York (state) New York, and was a familiar figure in air speed record attempts in the New York area. He won the Schneider Trophy Schneider Cup race in a Curtiss R3C in 1925 with an average speed of 232 MPH.<ref name="flightp703">Flight October 29, 1925, p.703.</ref>  For that feat, Doolittle was awarded the Mackay Trophy in 1926.

In April 1926, Doolittle was given a leave of absence to go to South America to perform demonstration flights. In Chile, he broke both ankles, but put his Curtiss P-1 Hawk P-1 Hawk through aerial maneuvers with his ankles in casts. He returned to the United States, and was confined to Walter Reed Army Medical Center Walter Reed Army Hospital for his injuries until April 1927. Doolittle was then assigned to McCook Field for experimental work, with additional duty as an instructor pilot to the 385th Bomb Squadron of the Air Corps Reserve. During this time, in 1927 he was the first to perform an outside loop previously thought to be a fatal maneuver. Carried out in a Curtiss fighter at Wright Field in Ohio, Doolittle executed the dive from 10,000 feet, reached 280 miles per hour, bottomed out upside down, then climbed and completed the loop.

Doolittles most important contribution to aeronautical technology was the development of Instrument flight rules instrument flying. He was the first to recognize that true operational freedom in the air could not be achieved unless pilots developed the ability to control and navigate aircraft in flight, from takeoff run to landing rollout, regardless of the range of vision from the cockpit. Doolittle was the first to envision that a pilot could be trained to use instruments to fly through fog, clouds, precipitation of all forms, darkness, or any other impediment to visibility; and in spite of the pilots own possibly convoluted motion sense inputs. Even at this early stage, the ability to control aircraft was getting beyond the motion sense capability of the pilot. That is, as aircraft became faster and more maneuverable, pilots could become seriously disoriented without visual cues from outside the cockpit, because aircraft could move in ways that pilots senses could not accurately decipher.

Doolittle was also the first to recognize these psycho-physiological limitations of the human senses (particularly the motion sense inputs, i.e., up, down, left, right). He initiated the study of the subtle interrelationships between the psychological effects of visual cues and motion senses. His research resulted in programs that trained pilots to read and understand navigational instruments. A pilot learned to "trust his instruments," not his senses, as visual cues and his motion sense inputs (what he sensed and "felt") could be incorrect or unreliable.

In 1929, he became the first pilot to take off, fly and land an airplane using Flight instruments instruments alone, without a view outside the cockpit. Having returned to Mitchel Field that September, he assisted in the development of fog flying equipment. He helped develop, and was then the first to test, the now universally used Attitude indicator artificial horizon and Heading indicator directional gyroscope. He attracted wide newspaper attention with this feat of Instrument flight rules "blind" flying and later received the Harmon Trophy for conducting the experiments. These accomplishments made all-weather airline operations practical.

In January 1930, he advised the Army on the construction of Floyd Bennett Field in New York City. Doolittle resigned his regular commission on February 15, 1930, and was commissioned a Major in the Air Reserve Corps a month later, being named manager of the Aviation Department of Shell Oil Company, in which capacity he conducted numerous aviation tests.<ref>{{cite book title=A History in the Making: 80 Turbulent Years in the American General Aviation Industry author=Donald M. Pattillo page=16}}</ref> While in the Reserve, he also returned to temporary active duty with the Army frequently to conduct tests.

Doolittle helped influence Shell Oil Company to produce the first quantities of Octane rating 100 octane aviation gasoline. High octane fuel was crucial to the high-performance planes that were developed in the late 1930s.

In 1931, Doolittle won the first Bendix Trophy race from Burbank, California, to Cleveland, in a Laird Super Solution biplane.

In 1932, Doolittle set the worlds high speed record for land planes at 296 miles per hour in the Shell Speed Dash. Later, he took the Thompson Trophy race at Cleveland in the notorious Gee Bee R-1 racer with a speed averaging 252 miles per hour. After having won the three big air racing trophies of the time, the Schneider, Bendix, and Thompson, he officially retired from air racing stating, "I have yet to hear anyone engaged in this work dying of old age."

In April 1934, Doolittle was selected to be a member of the Baker Board. Chaired by former United States Secretary of War Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, the board was convened during the Air Mail scandal to study Air Corps organization. In 1940, he became president of the Institute of Aeronautical Science.

Doolittle returned to active duty in the U.S. Army Air Corps on July 1, 1940 with rank of Major. He was assigned as the assistant district supervisor of the Central Air Corps Procurement District at Indianapolis, and Detroit, where he worked with large auto manufacturers on the conversion of their plants for production of planes.<ref>Herman, Arthur.

{{Main Doolittle Raid}}

Following the reorganization of the Army Air Corps into the USAAF in 1941 in aviation#June June 1941, Doolittle was promoted to Lieutenant colonel (United States) lieutenant colonel on January 2, 1942, and assigned to Army Air Forces Headquarters to plan the first retaliatory air raid on the Japanese homeland. He volunteered for and received Henry H. Arnold General H.H. Arnolds approval to lead the top secret attack of 16 B-25 Mitchell B-25 medium bombers from the aircraft carrier {{USS Hornet CV-8 6}}, with targets in Tokyo, Kobe, Yokohama, Osaka and Nagoya.

After training at Eglin AFB Eglin Field and Wagner Field in northwest Florida, Doolittle, his aircraft and volunteer flight crews proceeded to McClellan AFB McClellan Field, California for aircraft modifications at the Sacramento Air Depot, followed by a short final flight to Naval Air Station Alameda, California for embarkation aboard the aircraft carrier USS Hornet (CV-8) USS Hornet. On April 18, Doolittle and his 16 B-25 crews took off from the Hornet, reached Japan, and bombed their targets. Fifteen of the planes then headed for their recovery airfield in China, while one crew chose to land in Russia due to their bombers unusually high fuel consumption. As did most of the other crewmen who participated in the one-way mission, Doolittle and his crew bailed out safely over China when their B-25 ran out of fuel. By then, they had been flying for about 12 hours, it was nighttime, the weather was stormy, and Doolittle was unable to locate their landing field. Doolittle came down in a rice paddy (saving a previously injured ankle from breaking) near Chuchow (Quzhou). He and his crew linked up after the bailout and were helped through Japanese lines by Chinese guerrillas and American missionary John Birch (missionary) John Birch. Other aircrews were not so fortunate, although most eventually reached safety with the help of friendly Chinese. Seven crew members lost their lives, four as a result of being captured by the Japanese and three due to an aircraft crash or while parachuting. Doolittle thought he would be court martialed due to having to launch the raid ahead of schedule after being spotted by Japanese patrol boats.

Doolittle went on to fly more combat missions as commander of the 12th Air Force in North Africa, for which he was awarded four Air Medals. The other surviving members of the Doolittle raid also went on to new assignments.

Doolittle received the Medal of Honor from President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House for planning and leading his raid on Japan. His citation reads: "For conspicuous leadership above and beyond the call of duty, involving personal valor and intrepidity at an extreme hazard to life. With the apparent certainty of being forced to land in enemy territory or to perish at sea, Lt. Col. Doolittle personally led a squadron of Army bombers, manned by volunteer crews, in a highly destructive raid on the Japanese mainland."

The Doolittle Raid is viewed by historians as a major morale-building victory for the United States. Although the damage done to Japanese war industry was minor, the raid showed the Japanese that their homeland was vulnerable to air attack, and forced them to withdraw several front-line fighter units from Pacific war zones for homeland defense. More significantly, Japanese commanders considered the raid deeply embarrassing, and their attempt to close the perceived gap in their Pacific defense perimeter led directly to the decisive American victory at the Battle of Midway in June 1942.

When asked from where the Tokyo raid was launched, President Roosevelt coyly said its base was Shangri-La, a fictional paradise from the popular novel Lost Horizon. In the same vein, the U.S. Navy named one of its Essex-class aircraft carrier Essex-class fleet carriers the {{USS Shangri-La CV-38 6}}.

==World War II, post-raid==
File:Doolittle1.jpg thumb left Lt. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle (left) with Maj. Gen. Curtis LeMay (right), standing in front of a Lockheed P-38 Lightning in Britain, 1944

In July 1942, as a Brigadier general (United States) brigadier general—he had been promoted by two grades on the day after the Tokyo attack, bypassing the rank of full Colonel (United States) colonel—Doolittle was assigned to the nascent Eighth Air Force. This followed his rejection by General Douglas MacArthur as commander of the South West Pacific Area (command) South West Pacific Area to replace Major General George Brett (general) George Brett. Major General Frank Maxwell Andrews Frank Andrews first turned down the position, and, offered a choice between George Kenney and Doolittle, MacArthur chose Kenney.{{sfn Wolk 2003 pp=21-22}} In September, Doolittle became commanding general of the Twelfth Air Force, soon to be operating in North Africa. He was promoted to Major general (United States) major general in November 1942, and in March 1943 became commanding general of the Northwest African Strategic Air Force, a unified command of U.S. Army Air Force and Royal Air Force units. In September, he commanded a raid against the Italian town of Battipaglia that was so thorough in its destruction that General Carl Andrew Spaatz sent him a joking message: "Youre slipping Jimmy. Theres one crabapple tree and one stable still standing."<ref>{{cite book title=The Second World War year=2012 isbn=978-0-7538-2824-3 author=Antony Beevor page=503}}</ref>

Maj. Gen. Doolittle took command of the Fifteenth Air Force in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations in November 1943. On June 10, he flew as co-pilot with Jack Sims, fellow Tokyo Raider, in a B-26 Marauder of the 320th Air Expeditionary Wing 320th Bombardment Group, 442nd Bombardment Squadron on a mission to attack gun emplacements at Pantelleria. Doolittle continued to fly, despite the risk of capture, while being privy to the Ultra secret, which was that the German encryption systems had been broken by the British.<ref name=enigma>{{cite web title=Enigmatic Man url=http://www.ghspaulding.com/enigmatic_man.htm author=G. H. Spaulding, CAPT, USN (Ret) accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> From January 1944 to September 1945, he held his largest command, the Eighth Air Force (8 AF) in England as a Lieutenant general (United States) lieutenant general, his promotion date being March 13, 1944 and the highest rank ever held by an active reserve officer in modern times.

===Doolittles breakthrough in fighter tactics===

Doolittles major influence on the European air war occurred early in 1943 when he changed the policy requiring escorting fighters to remain with their bombers at all times. Doolittle allowed American fighter escorts to fly far ahead of the bombers combat box formations in air supremacy mode.  Throughout most of 1944 this tactic negated the effectiveness of the twin-engined Zerstörergeschwader heavy fighter wings (and their replacement, single-engined Sturmgruppen of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmböcke heavily armed Fw 190As) by clearing opposition of the Luftwaffes bomber destroyers from the airspace ahead of the bomber formations on their way to their targets. After the bombers had hit their targets, the USAAFs fighters were then free to strafe German airfields and transport on their trips returning to base.

These tasks were initially performed with Lockheed P-38 Lightnings and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts through the end of 1943. These were progressively replaced with the long-ranged North American P-51 Mustangs as the spring of 1944 wore on.

===Post-VE Day===

File:JimmyDoolittleAutographed.jpg thumb right Personalized photo of General Jimmy Doolittle
After the end of the European war, the Eighth Air Force was re-equipped with B-29 Superfortress bombers and started to relocate to Okinawa in the Pacific. Two bomb groups had begun to arrive on August 7. However, the 8th was not scheduled to be at full strength until February 1946 and Doolittle declined to rush 8th Air Force units into combat saying that "If the war is over, I will not risk one airplane nor a single bomber crew member just to be able to say the 8th Air Force had operated against the Japanese in the Pacific".

==Postwar==

===Doolittle Board===

On 27 March 1946, Doolittle was requested by United States Secretary of War Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson to head a commission on the relationships between officers and enlisted men in the U.S. Army. Called the "Doolittle Board", or informally the "GI Gripes Board", many of the recommendations were implemented for the postwar volunteer U.S. Army,<ref>p. 154 Brown, Jerold E. Historical Dictionary of the U.S. Army Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001</ref> though many professional officers and noncommissioned officers thought the Board "destroyed the discipline of the Army".<ref>p. 105 Zellers, Larry In Enemy Hands: A Prisoner in North Korea University Press of Kentucky, 1 Nov 1999</ref> After the Korean War, columnist Hanson Baldwin said the Doolittle Board "caused severe damage to service effectiveness by recommendations intended to democratize the Army—a concept that is self-contradictory".<ref>p. 51 Bogle, Lori L.

===U.S. space program===

Doolittle became acquainted with the field of space science in its infancy. He wrote in his autobiography, "I became interested in rocket development in the 1930s when I met Robert H. Goddard, who laid the foundation [in the US].... While with Shell [Oil] I worked with him on the development of a type of [rocket] fuel...."<ref name="Doolittle">{{cite book last1=Doolittle first1=General James H. "Jimmy" with Carroll V. Glines title=I Could Never Be So Lucky Again date=1991 publisher=Bantam Books location=New York page=515}}</ref> Harry Guggenheim, whose foundation sponsored Goddards work, and Charles Lindbergh, who encouraged Goddards efforts, arranged for (then Major) Doolittle to discuss with Goddard a special blend of gasoline. Doolittle piloted himself to Roswell, New Mexico in October 1938 and was given a tour of Goddards workshop and a "short course" in rocketry and space travel. He then wrote a memo, including a rather detailed description of Goddards rocket. In closing he said, "interplanetary transportation is probably a dream of the very distant future, but with the moon only a quarter of a million miles away—who knows!"<ref name="Papers">{{cite book last1=Goddard first1=Esther and G. Edward Pendray, eds. title=The Papers of Robert H. Goddard, 3 vols. date=1970 publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Co. location=New York pages=1208–16}}</ref> In July 1941 he wrote Goddard that he was still interested in rocket propulsion research. The Army, however, was interested only in JATO at this point. Doolittle was concerned about the state of rocketry in the US and remained in touch with Goddard.<ref name="Papers"/>{{rp 1443}}

Shortly after World War II, Doolittle spoke to an American Rocket Society conference at which a large number interested in rocketry attended. The topic was Robert Goddards work. He later stated that at that time "...we [the aeronautics field in the US] had not given much credence to the tremendous potential of rocketry.<ref>{{cite web last1=Putnam first1=William D. and Eugene M.

In 1956, he was appointed chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) because the previous chairman, Jerome C. Hunsaker, thought Doolittle to be more sympathetic to the rocket, which was increasing in importance as a scientific tool as well as a weapon.<ref name="Doolittle"/>{{rp 516}} The NACA Special Committee on Space Technology was organized in January 1958 and chaired by Guy Stever to determine the requirements of a national space program and what additions were needed to NACA technology. Doolittle, Dr. Hugh Dryden and Stever selected committee members, such as Dr. Wernher von Braun from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, Sam Hoffman of Rocketdyne, Abe Hyatt of the Office of Naval Research and Colonel Norman Appold from the USAF missile program, considering their potential contributions to US space programs and ability to educate NACA people in space science.<ref name="Bilstein">{{cite book last1=Bilstein first1=Roger E. title=Stages to Saturn date=1980 publisher=University Press of Florida location=Gainesville page=34}}</ref>

===Reserve status===

On 5 January 1946, Doolittle reverted to inactive reserve status in the Army Air Forces in the grade of lieutenant general, a rarity in those days when nearly all other reserve officers were limited to the rank of major general or rear admiral, a restriction that would not end in the US armed forces until the 21st century. He retired from the United States Army on 10 May 1946. On 18 September 1947, his reserve commission as a general officer was transferred to the newly established United States Air Force. Doolittle returned to Shell Oil as a vice president, and later as a director.

In the summer of 1946, Doolittle went to Stockholm where he was consulted about the "ghost rockets" that had been observed over Scandinavia.<ref>{{cite book title=Operation Trojan Horse year=1996 isbn=978-0962653469 page=122 author=John Keel url=http://galaksija.com/literatura/jk_oth.pdf deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420102608/http://galaksija.com/literatura/jk_oth.pdf archivedate=April 20, 2013 df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 1947, Doolittle also became the first president of the Air Force Association, an organization which he helped create.

In 1948, Doolittle advocated the desegregation of the US military. "I am convinced", emphasized Doolittle, "that the solution to the situation is to forget that they are colored." Industry was in the process of integrating, Doolittle said, "and it is going to be forced on the military. You are merely postponing the inevitable and you might as well take it gracefully."<ref>{{Cite journal url=http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/1998/July%201998/0798color.aspx title=When the Color Line Ended

In March 1951, Doolittle was appointed a special assistant to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, serving as a civilian in scientific matters which led to Air Force ballistic missile and space programs. In 1952, following a string of three air crashes in two months at Elizabeth, New Jersey, the President of the United States, Harry S. Truman, appointed him to lead a presidential commission examining the safety of urban airports. The report "Airports and Their Neighbors" led to zoning requirements for buildings near approaches, early noise control requirements, and initial work on "super airports" with 10,000&nbsp;ft runways, suited to 150 ton aircraft.

Doolittle was appointed a life member of the MIT Corporation, the universitys board of trustees, an uncommon permanent appointment, and served as an MIT Corporation Member for 40 years.<ref>{{cite web url=http://web.mit.edu/corporation/membership/pastmembers.html title=Members of the MIT Corporation work=mit.edu}}</ref>

In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower asked Doolittle to perform a study of the Central Intelligence Agency; The resulting work was known as the Doolittle Report, 1954, and was classified for a number of years.

In January 1956, Eisenhower asked Doolittle to serve as a member on the first edition of the Presidents Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities which, years later, would become known as the Presidents Intelligence Advisory Board.{{citation needed date=March 2015}}

From 1957 to 1958, he was National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics#NACA chairmen chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA).  This period was during the events of Sputnik I Sputnik, Vanguard 1 Vanguard and Explorer I Explorer.  He was the last person to hold this position, as the NACA was superseded by NASA.  Doolittle was offered the job of being the first administrator of NASA, but he turned it down.<ref name=Putnam>{{cite book last1=Putnam first1=William D. and Eugene M.

Doolittle retired from Air Force Reserve duty on February 28, 1959. He remained active in other capacities, including chairman of the board of TRW Inc. TRW Space Technology Laboratories.

In 1972, Doolittle received the Tony Jannus Award for his distinguished contributions to commercial aviation, in recognition of the development of instrument flight.

On April 4, 1985, the U.S. Congress promoted Doolittle to the rank of full four-star General (United States) general (O-10) on the U.S. Air Force retired list. In a later ceremony, President Ronald Reagan and United States Senate U.S. Senator and retired Air Force Reserve Major General Barry Goldwater pinned on Doolittles General (United States) four-star insignia.

In addition to his Medal of Honor for the Tokyo raid, Doolittle received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, two Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army) Distinguished Service Medals, the Silver Star, three Distinguished Flying Cross (U.S.) Distinguished Flying Crosses, the Bronze Star Medal, four Air Medals, and decorations from Belgium, China, Ecuador, France, Great Britain, and Poland. He was the first American to be awarded both the Medal of Honor and the Medal of Freedom.

==Personal life==

Doolittle married Josephine "Jo" E. Daniels on December 24, 1917. At a dinner celebration after Jimmy Doolittles first all-instrument flight in 1929, Josephine Doolittle asked her guests to sign her white damask tablecloth. Later, she embroidered the names in black. She continued this tradition, collecting hundreds of signatures from the aviation world. The tablecloth was donated to the Smithsonian Institution. Married for over 70 years, Josephine Doolittle died in 1988, five years before her husband.

The Doolittles had two sons, James Jr., and John. Both became military officers and pilots. James Jr. was an A-26 Invader pilot in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II and later a fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Force in the late 1940s through the late 1950s. He committed suicide at the age of thirty-eight in 1958.<ref>{{Cite news url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060720/FEATURES/607200583/1021/FEATURES02 title=My grandfather The General last=Rife first=Susan L. date=July 20, 2006 publisher=Herald Tribune accessdate=May 1, 2009}}</ref> At the time of his death, James Jr. was a Major and commander of the 524th Fighter Squadron 524th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, piloting the F-101 Voodoo.<ref>{{cite web url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1913&dat=19580415&id=4nEgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RGcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1734,4598721 title=Lewiston Evening Journal - Google News Archive Search work=google.com}}</ref>

His other son, John P. Doolittle, retired from the Air Force as a Colonel, and his grandson, Colonel James H. Doolittle III, was the vice commander of the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

James H. "Jimmy" Doolittle died at the age of 96 in Pebble Beach, California on September 27, 1993, and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, near Washington, D.C., next to his wife.<ref name=findagrave>{{Find a Grave 2454 work=Claim to Fame: Medal of Honor recipients accessdate=July 26, 2008}}</ref> In his honor at the funeral, there was also a flyover of Miss Mitchell, a lone B-25 Mitchell, and USAF Eighth Air Force bombers from Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana.  After a brief graveside service, fellow Doolittle Raider Bill Bower began the final tribute on the bugle. When emotion took over, Doolittles great-grandson, Paul Dean Crane, Jr., played Taps.<ref>{{cite web url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postmortem/2011/01/bill-bower-dies-doolittle-raid.html title=Post Mortem  - Bill Bower dies; Doolittle Raider was last surviving pilot work=washingtonpost.com}}</ref>{{clear left}}
