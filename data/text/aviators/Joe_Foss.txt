==Early years==
Foss was born in an unelectrified farmhouse near Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the oldest son of Mary Esther (née Lacey) and Frank Ole Foss. He was of Norwegian and Scottish descent.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1417707/Joe-Foss.html "Joe Foss obituary"], The Telegraph, January 3, 2003.</ref> At age 12, he visited an airfield in Renner, South Dakota Renner to see Charles Lindbergh on tour with his aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis. Four years later, he and his father paid $1.50 apiece to take their first aircraft ride in a Ford Trimotor at Black Hills Airport with a famed South Dakota aviator, Black Hills Airport Clyde Ice.<ref name="SDPB"/>

In March 1933, while coming back from the fields during a storm, his father was killed when he drove over a downed electrical cable and was electrocuted as he stepped out of his automobile.<ref>Bauer January 1990, p. 20.</ref> Young Foss, not yet 18 years old, pitched in with his mother and brother Cliff to continue running the family farm.<ref name="Sims p. 32"/> Farming was made difficult by dust storms, which over the next two years took its toll on crops and livestock.{{citation needed date=October 2016}}

After watching a Marine Corps aerial team, led by Capt. Clayton Jerome, perform aerobatics in open-cockpit biplanes, he was determined to become a Marine aviator.<ref name="Legend"/> Foss worked at a service station to pay for books and college tuition, and to begin flight lessons from Roy Lanning, at the Sioux Skyway Airfield in 1938, scraping up $65 to pay for the instruction. His younger brother took over the management of the farm and allowed Foss to go back to school and graduate from Washington High School in Sioux Falls. He graduated from the University of South Dakota in 1939 with a degree in business administration.<ref>[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jjfoss.htm "WWII ace Joe Foss dies at 87"], arlingtoncemetery.net; retrieved February 22, 2016.</ref>

While at USD, Foss and other like-minded students convinced authorities to set up a Civil Aeronautics Board CAA flying course at the university; he built up 100 flight hours by graduation.<ref name="Sims p. 32"/> Foss paid his way through university by "bussing" tables. He joined the Sigma chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and excelled at sports in USD, fighting on the college boxing team, participating as a member of the track team and as a second-string guard on the football team.<ref name="Sims p. 32"/><ref>[http://www.nicindy.org/whos_greek/medal_of_honor_recipients "Medal of Honor recipients"], nicindy.org; accessed August 3, 2011.</ref>

===Effort to become a fighter pilot===
After being designated a Naval Aviator, Foss graduated at Pensacola, Florida and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant#United States second lieutenant, then served as a "plowback" instructor at Naval Air Station Pensacola. At 26 years of age, he was considered too old to be a fighter pilot, and was instead sent to the Navy School of Photography. Upon completion of his initial assignment, he was transferred to VMSB-151 Marine Photographic Squadron 1 (VMO-1) stationed at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, California. Dissatisfied with his role in photographic reconnaissance, Foss made repeated requests to be transferred to a fighter qualification program. He checked out in Grumman F4F Wildcats while still assigned to VMO-1, logging over 150 flight hours in June and July, 1942, and was eventually transferred to Marine Fighting Squadron 121 VMF-121 as the executive officer.{{#tag:ref Although only 27, his squadron mates gave him the unflattering nickname of "Old Foos."<ref name="Miller p. 115"/> group=Note}} While stateside, Foss married his high school sweetheart, June Shakstad in 1942.<ref name="Bauer p. 40"/>

On January 11, 2002, Foss, then 86, was in the news when he was detained by security at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. He was scheduled to deliver an address at the National Rifle Association and speak to a class at the United States Military Academy at West Point. A search necessitated by his pacemaker precluding a metal detector screening had led to the discovery of the star-shaped Medal of Honor, along with a clearly marked dummy-bullet keychain, a second replica bullet and a small nail file (with MOH insignia).

The incident caused a furor with both media and public support given to Foss. Newsman Jack Cafferty noted that airport security personnel demonstrated poor judgment in not recognizing the Medal of Honor and in demanding to confiscate and destroy the medal and related memorabilia. He eventually lost a souvenir replica bullet, but was able to retain his Medal of Honor and commemorative nail file, by shipping it back to himself.<ref name="Cafferty">Cafferty, Jack.

CAPTAIN JOSEPH J. FOSS<br/>
UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE<br/>
</center>
for service as set forth in the following CITATION:
<blockquote>
For outstanding heroism and courage above and beyond the call of duty as Executive Officer of a Marine Fighting Squadron, at Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands. Engaging in almost daily combat with the enemy from October 9 to November 19, 1942, Captain Foss personally shot down 23 Japanese aircraft and damaged others so severely that their destruction was extremely probable. In addition, during this period, he successfully led a large number of escort missions, skillfully covering reconnaissance, bombing and photographic planes as well as surface craft. On January 15, 1943, he added three more enemy aircraft to his already brilliant successes for a record of aerial combat achievement unsurpassed in this war. Boldly searching out an approaching enemy force on January 25, Captain Foss led his eight F4F Marine planes and four Army P-38s into action and, undaunted by tremendously superior numbers, intercepted and struck with such force that four Japanese fighters were shot down and the bombers were turned back without releasing a single bomb. His remarkable flying skill, inspiring leadership and indomitable fighting spirit were distinctive factors in the defense of strategic American positions on Guadalcanal.</blockquote>/S/ Franklin D. Roosevelt}}
