Herbert John Louis Hinkler {{postnominals country=AUS size=100% sep=, AFC DSMuk}} (8 December 1892 – 7 January 1933), better known as Bert Hinkler, was a pioneer Australian aviator (dubbed "Australian Lone Eagle"<ref name="Scanlon"/>) and inventor.  He designed and built early aircraft before being the first person to fly solo from England to Australia, and the first person to fly solo across the Southern Atlantic Ocean. He married in 1932 at the age of 39, and died less than a year later after crashing into remote countryside near Florence, Italy during a solo flight record attempt.

==Early life==
Hinkler was born in Bundaberg, Queensland, the son of John William Hinkler, a Prussian-born stockman, and his wife Frances Atkins (née Bonney) Hinkler.<ref>Queensland Registrar-General Index of Births, Deaths & Marriages</ref><ref name="Pioneer">Pioneer airmans;memory lives on. Heidelberger Leader (Australia). NEWS; Pg. 14. 12 November 2003.</ref> In his childhood, Hinkler would observe ibis flying near a lake at his school. After gaining an understanding on the principles of flight, he constructed and flew two Glider aircraft gliders on beaches near his home town. He later met Arthur Burr Stone,<ref name=ADB>

In 1913, Hinkler went to England where he worked for the Sopwith Aviation Company,<ref name="Scanlon"/> the beginning of his career in aviation.

==World War I==
During the First World War, Hinkler served with the Royal Naval Air Service as a Air gunner gunner/Air observer observer<ref name="Scanlon"/> in Belgium and France, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (United Kingdom) Distinguished Service Medal. In 1918 Hinkler was posted to No. 28 Squadron RAF with which he served as a pilot in Italy.

Hinkler was an "exceptional mathematician and inventor" and "made a lot of aviation instruments which were in use up until the Second World War."<ref name="Scanlon"/> For example, "one was a gadget to correct drift as airplanes fly a little bit on their side, not straight ahead."<ref name="Scanlon"/> Furthermore, "in WWI, Hinkler invented a machine gun adaptor for air gunners. Back then, when the biplanes were flying upside down in combat, the hot, ejected shells would fall and burn the chest of the gunners as they fired. Hinklers invention had the ejected shells all flying off to one side instead."<ref name="Scanlon"/>

==Later life and career==
After the war, he worked as a test pilot for the aircraft manufacturer avro A.V. Roe in Southampton. The Australian Government offered £10,000 as a prize for the first flight to Australia; Hinkler entered, but his aeroplane crashed in Europe during a storm.<ref>{{Dictionary of Australian Biography First=Herbert John Louis Last=Hinkler shortlink=

In 1921, Hinkler shipped a tiny Avro Baby to Sydney.  It was filled with fuel and flown non-stop to Bundaberg, Queensland, a distance of {{convert 1370 km mi}}.

During the 1920s he competed in numerous aviation events and set many records, among which was a non-stop flight from England to Latvia. He was a pilot of the British Schneider Trophy seaplane competitor.

Hinkler flew the first solo flight between England and Australia, departing England on 7 February 1928 and arriving in Darwin, Northern Territory Darwin on 22 February 1928 and back in his home town of Bundaberg on 27 February 1928. This reduced the England-Australia record from 28&nbsp;days to just under 15½ days. The aircraft used was an Avro Avian, registration G-EBOV.  The flight was little noticed before Hinkler reached India but then media interest intensified.  One paper nicknamed the flyer "Hustling Hinkler"<ref name="Scanlon">Flying in the face of adversity. Mike Scanlon. HISTORY H2; Pg. 16. Newcastle Herald (Australia). 29 March 2008.</ref> and he was the subject of the Tin Pan Alley song Hustling Hinkler Up in the Sky.<ref name="Harris">Magnificent machines, home-grown legends; CENTENARY OF FLIGHT.

For the flights in 1920 and 1928 Hinkler had already won two Britannia Trophy Britannia trophies and the gold medal of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale.<ref name=ADB/>

Hinkler is quoted as telling the Australian Prime Minister Stanley Bruce at this time: "You know, one day, people will fly by night and use the daylight for sightseeing." (In 1998 Australian Lang Kidby recreated this flight in a similar 1927 Avro Avian). He was invited by the Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives Speaker of the House of Representatives to be seated on the floor of the House in recognition of his achievement. (The next time such an invitation was extended was in 1973, to Patrick White, who declined.<ref>Gavin Souter, Acts of Parliament, p. 516</ref>) After visiting the principal cities of Australia and returning to England, he was awarded the Air Force Cross (United Kingdom) Air Force Cross for the finest aerial exploit of the year.

In 1931 came his most remarkable feat. Hinkler flew in a de Havilland Puss Moth from Canada to New York then non-stop to Jamaica {{convert 2400 km mi abbr=on}}, then to Venezuela, Guyana, Brazil, and then across the South Atlantic to Africa; this part of the journey was done in extremely bad weather, but despite a tearing gale and practically no visibility for part of the way because of low and heavy clouds, he drifted a comparatively small distance off his course. From West Africa he flew to London. For this he was awarded the Segrave Trophy, the Johnston Memorial Prize, and the Britannia Trophy for the most meritorious flying performance of the year.  This was the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean South Atlantic.  He was only the second person to cross the Atlantic solo, after Charles Lindbergh.

He is remembered as being thoroughly courageous without being reckless, and was successful in his amazing feats because he was practically faultless as a pilot, and knew exactly what he and his machines could do.

==Relic survives the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster==
A small piece of wood, a relic from one Hinklers hand-made gliders, was presented to the US astronaut Don Lind in early 1986 as a token of appreciation for his coming to Bundaberg to contribute to the Hinkler Memorial Lectures.  Lind in turn gave it to Dick Scobee, the captain of the ill-fated final Challenger mission.  Scobee took the wood with him on board the Challenger, inside a small plastic bag that he placed in his locker.  After the explosion, the bag and the wood were recovered from the sea, identified, mounted, and later returned to the Hinkler Memorial Museum.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/widebay/stories/s1565619.htm www.abc.net]</ref><ref>[http://www.ministers.infrastructure.gov.au/ja/releases/2004/September/a135_2004.htm www.ministers.infrastructure.gov]</ref>
