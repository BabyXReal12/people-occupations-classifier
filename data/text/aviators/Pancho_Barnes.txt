==Aviation career==
Having spent four months abroad in Mexico, getting caught up with revolutionaries and escaping the attention of authorities, disguised as a man, she began to use the nickname "Pancho" about this time.<ref name= "p.138">Gibson 2013, p. 138.</ref>  Barnes returned to San Marino, California, with an inheritance bequeathed her on her parents death. In 1928, while driving her cousin Dean Banks to flying lessons, she decided to learn to fly, and convinced her cousins flight instructor, Ben Caitlin, a World War I veteran, of her desire that same day.<ref name= "p.138"/> She soloed after six hours of formal instruction.<ref name=cent/>

Barnes ran an ad-hoc barnstorming show and competed in air races. Despite a crash in the 1929 Womens Air Derby, she returned in 1930 under the sponsorship of the Union Oil Company to win the race &ndash; and break Amelia Earharts world womens speed record with a speed of 196.19&nbsp;mph (315.7&nbsp;km/h). Barnes broke this record in a Travel Air Type R Mystery Ship.<ref name=cent/><ref>Pelletier 2012, pp. 177, 178, 183–185.</ref>

After her contract with Union Oil expired, Barnes moved to Hollywood to work as a stunt pilot for movies. In 1931, she started the Associated Motion Picture Pilots, a union of film industry stunt fliers which promoted flying safety and standardized pay for aerial stunt work. She flew in several air-adventure movies of the 1930s, including Howard Hughes Hells Angels (film) Hells Angels (1930).<ref>Gibson 2013, pp. 136–137.</ref>

Barnes had extensive connections in Hollywood. Her early close friend George Hurrell (1904–1992), then eking out a living as a painter and photographer in Laguna Beach, California, would later become the legendary head of the portrait department of MGM Studios. Barnes is credited with helping Hurrell start his career in Hollywood after he took the photo she was to use on her pilots license, introducing him to her Hollywood friends.{{#tag:ref Barnes encouraged Hurrell’s photography and often posed for him.

Barnes lost most of her money in the Great Depression. By 1935, she had only her apartment in Hollywood left. She sold it, and in March 1935 bought {{convert 180 acre ha lk=on}} of land in the Mojave Desert, near the Rogers dry lake bed and the nascent Muroc Field, then called March Field because it was an adjunct property of March Air Reserve Base March Army Air Base at that time.<ref name=cent/>

==The Happy Bottom Riding Club==
{{Main Happy Bottom Riding Club}}
On her land, Pancho Barnes built the Happy Bottom Riding Club, also known as the Rancho Oro Verde Fly-Inn Dude Ranch, a dude ranch and restaurant which catered to airmen at the nearby airfield and her friends from Hollywood. Pancho became very close friends with many of the early test pilots, including Chuck Yeager, General Jimmy Doolittle, and Buzz Aldrin. Panchos ranch became famous for the parties and high-flying lifestyle of all the guests.<ref>[http://happybottomridingclub.com/docs/happy_bottom_riding_club.pdf "Happy Bottom Riding Club."] Happybottomridingclub.com, November 24, 2012.</ref>

After successful flight trials, the Muroc and Edwards test pilots often enjoyed some good times at the Happy Bottom Riding Club. As proprietor, Barnes would offer them a customary free steak<ref name="Edwards.af.mil">[http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123144418 "Lassie Visits Pancho."]{{dead link date=January 2018  bot=InternetArchiveBot  fix-attempted=yes }} Edwards.af.mil.

A change of command in 1952, however, contributed to Barnes getting into a conflict with the United States Air Force.  The Air Force was planning for the future of aviation, and decided it needed to build a new, super-long runway to accommodate new aircraft that were being planned to run on atomic power.  That new runway would run directly across her ranch.  The Air Force originally offered her a price for her ranch, land, and facilities that was very close to the cost of undeveloped desert land. She requested a fair appraisal to better reflect the actual cost of replacement of her land and business, but in the midst of getting a re-appraisal, the base leadership accused her of running a house of ill-repute on her ranch. The effect of even the hint of impropriety resulted in her ranch and business being put off-limits to military personnel, and the value of her business plummeted.<ref name="background"/>

Barnes then filed a lawsuit against the Air Force to, as she put it, "Roust out the scoundrels in the government who would perpetrate such an injustice."  She knew that if she filed a lawsuit, she would have the opportunity to depose under oath the various leaders and personnel on base, and the truth would come out and clear her name.  During the height of the intense court battle, in 1953, her ranch burned in a fire of mysterious origin.  After the fire, the value of her ranch and business further plummeted to a level more closely reflecting the original buy-out offer from the Air Force.  Nonetheless, the court battle continued.  Barnes was determined to receive fair value for her land and business, and to clear her name.  A main contention of her defense was: "My grandfather founded the United States Air Force." On that argument, the court found in her favor and she was awarded $375,000 remuneration for her property and business.  Also, her name was cleared.  As it turned out, the proposed runway was never built.<ref name="background"/>

After the government bought her out, she moved to Cantil, California, in hopes of restarting a similar dude ranch business there.  It never happened. It was not until the late 1960s that Pancho once again became a commonplace figure at the base and began to be referred to as the "Mother of Edwards AFB."   The wounds began to heal as Pancho reconnected with many old-timers.  The officers mess at Edwards was renamed the Pancho Barnes Room.<ref name="background"/>

==Death==
Barnes suffered from breast cancer, likely the ultimate cause of her death. She was scheduled to be the keynote speaker at the Antelope Valley Aero Museums annual "Barnstormers Reunion" on April 5, 1975. However, when a friend called on March 30, 1975; she could not reach her. Her son Bill found her dead in her home and the coroner determined that she had died several days earlier.<ref name=obit>{{cite news  author=  title=Florence Barnes, 20s Aviator, Dies  url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/31/archives/florence-barnes-20s-aviator-dies-set-records-did-film-stunts-and.html  quote=  newspaper=New York Times  date=March 31, 1975 }}</ref><ref name=death/><ref name=cent/>  Bill obtained special permission which was granted from the United States Air Force to spread her ashes over the site of the Happy Bottom Riding Club.

==Legacy==
Her fourth husband, Eugene "Mac" McKendry, continued to live in Cantil and survived Barnes for many years.

Son Bill Barnes died piloting a North American P-51 Mustang flying near Fox Field in Lancaster in October 1980.  In 1940, she had founded Barnes Aviation of Lancaster, California Lancaster which Bill operated in his adult years. It remains in the general aviation business today.<ref name="Spark">Spark, Nick.
