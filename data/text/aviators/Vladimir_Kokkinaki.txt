==Records==
On 21 November 1935, Kokkinaki managed to obtain the unofficial Aircraft records world record for ceiling in a Polikarpov I-15 fighter, reaching the altitude of 14,575 meters. On 20 April 1936, he performed the Nesterov Loop for the first time with a twin-engine aircraft, a  TsKB-26 (the prototype of the Ilyushin Il-4), in the presence of Joseph Stalin.<ref>[http://www.ctrl-c.liu.se/misc/ram/tskb-26.html TsKB-26 (S.V. Ilyushin)]</ref> In 1936-1937, Kokkinaki set seven successive altitude with varying payload records with the TsKB-26.<ref name=airwar>[http://www.airwar.ru/history/aces/legend/pilot/kokkinaki.html Biography at airwar.ru]</ref><ref name=records>[http://www.ilyushin.org/eng/history/records.html World Records set up by the Aircraft Developed by the Ilyushin Experimental Design Bureau]</ref> His first official record, on 17 July 1936, was also the first official Soviet aviation record.<ref name=McCannon>McCannon (1998), p. 79</ref>

On 28 June 1937 Kokkinaki flew the circular Moscow - Sevastopol - Yekaterinburg Sverdlovsk - Moscow route, a distance of 5018&nbsp;km, with a DB-3, setting a record in both speed at 5000&nbsp;km range (with a median speed of 325&nbsp;km/h) and range on a circular route.<ref name=records/> This flight was followed three months later by the 4000&nbsp;km Moscow - Baku - Moscow route.<ref>[http://www.ilyushin.org/eng/history/flights.html Remarkable Flights accomplished by the aircraft developed by the Ilyushin Experimental Design Bureau]</ref> On 27–28 June 1938, on board a modified TsKB-30 named "Moscow Moskva", with A.M. Bryandinskiy as his navigator, Kokkinaki flew from Moscow to Spassk-Dalny in the Soviet Far East, covering a distance of 7,580&nbsp;km in 24 h 36 min, mostly at an altitude of 7000 meters, with an average speed of 307&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=TsKB-30>[http://www.ctrl-c.liu.se/misc/RAM/tskb-30.html TsKB-30 (S.V. Ilyushin)]</ref> For this feat, he was awarded the title "Hero of the Soviet Union" on 17 July.<ref name=warheroes/> On 28 April 1939, with Mikhail Kh. Gordienko as co-pilot, he tried to surpass this feat by performing a non-stop east-west transatlantic flight from Moscow to New York City, to coincide with the opening of the 1939 New York Worlds Fair "Land of Tomorrow" World Fair.<ref name=McCannon>McCannon (1998), p. 79</ref> However, due to encountering bad weather, the airplane was forced to come down on Miscou Island in New Brunswick, Canada ([http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,761240,00.html TIME magazine account]). Coming not long after the death of Valery Chkalov, and with the approaching war, this well-publicized debacle spelled the end of the Soviet Arctic aviation exploits of the 1930s. Despite failing to reach his original destination, he still covered a distance of 8,000&nbsp;km in 22 h 56 min, at an average speed of 348&nbsp;km/h,<ref name=TsKB-30/> and since 1959, the route he used (Moscow- Novgorod - Helsinki - Trondheim - Iceland - Cape Farewell, Greenland Cape Farewell - Miscou Island) is used for the regular flights between New York and Moscow. In 1965, he was honored by the International Air Transport Association with the diamond "Compass rose wind rose" necklace for his finding the "shortest flight route between Europe and America".<ref name=bse/><ref name=warheroes/>

From 1958 to 1960, he set another series of thirteen altitude with load and speed records flying the Ilyushin Il-18.<ref name=warheroes/> His last world record was in 1960, when he flew an Il-18 at a distance of 5,018 kilometers with a payload of 10,000&nbsp;kg and a median speed of 693&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=records/>
