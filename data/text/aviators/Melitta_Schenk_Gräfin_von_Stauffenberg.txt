Melitta Schenk Gräfin
von Stauffenberg, born Melitta Schiller (3 January 1903 – 8 April 1945)
, was an aviatrix who served as a test pilot in the Luftwaffe before and during World War II.

She was the second German woman to be awarded the honorary title of Flugkapitän ({{lang-en flight captain}}) and also flew over 2,500 test flights in dive bombers, the second most of any Luftwaffe test pilot. Von Stauffenberg was awarded the Iron Cross Iron Cross Second Class and the Front Flying Clasp of the Luftwaffe Gold Front Flying Clasp for Bombers with diamonds, for performing over 1,500 test flights in dive bomber aircraft. In 1944, she was arrested with other Stauffenberg family members on suspicion of conspiring with her brothers-in-law to 20 July plot assassinate Adolf Hitler, but she was later released to continue her test flight duties.

Countess von Stauffenberg died after being shot down by an Allies of World War II Allied fighter plane on 8 April 1945.

==Biography==
Melitta was born in Krotoszyn Krotoschin, Prussia.  Her father was Michael Schiller. Her mother was Margaret Eberstein. She had four siblings: Marie-Luise, Otto, Jutta and Klara. The family moved to Jelenia Góra Hirschberg in Silesia.

===Early life===
Melitta passed the diploma for university entrance in 1922. There she studied mathematics, physics and Engineering, eventually specialising in aeronautical engineering at the Technical University of Munich. In 1927 she graduated cum laude.

===Aviation experience===
Melitta started working for the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt (DVL), an experimental institute for aviation, in Berlin-Adlershof in 1928. She also took flying lessons. She married the historian Alexander Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg in 1937.

On 28 October 1937, she qualified as a Flugkapitänin, or "aircraft captain", a rank reserved for test pilots in Germany at the time, and became only the second woman in Germany, after Hanna Reitsch, to achieve this. She eventually gained licences for all classes of powered aircraft, the acrobatic flying licence, and the Glider (sailplane) glider licence.

===World War II===
{{Unreferenced section date=January 2011}}
At the beginning of World War II, Melitta wanted to work for the Red Cross but was ordered to become a test pilot for the Luftwaffe at Rechlin-Lärz Airfield the central Erprobungsstelle test facility in Rechlin, Mecklenburg. She did test dives in warplanes, up to 15 times a day, from a height of 4,000 metres. 
From 1942, Melitta Schenk Gräfin von Stauffenberg continued her test-flights at the Luftwaffes technical academy in RAF Gatow Berlin-Gatow. She was attacked by Allied aircraft, and was awarded the Iron Cross Iron Cross 2nd Class on 22 January 1943. She made her dissertation for her Masters qualification in 1944, and received an A grade. She then became technical chief of the Versuchsstelle für Flugsondergeräte, another test institute, in the same year.

When the 20 July plot failed, she was arrested with the rest of the Stauffenberg family. Although her two brothers-in-law, Claus von Stauffenberg Claus and Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg Berthold were executed and the other adult members were held in concentration camps, she was released on 2 September, because of the military importance of her work. As the name von Stauffenberg was anything but popular among the Nazis, she was now officially addressed as "Gräfin Schenk" instead of "Gräfin Schenk von Stauffenberg". Her husband and her sisters-in-law were confined in concentration camps, and the Stauffenberg children were taken away from their mothers. Melitta used her prominent position to help as much as she could.

She felt loyal to Germany, but not to the National Socialist German Workers Party National Socialists. She therefore supported the Luftwaffe, but she confessed in her diaries that this moral conflict tormented her. {{citation needed date=December 2010}}

===Death===
On 8 April 1945, while transferring a small Bü 181 Bestmann trainer to southern Germany, Gräfin von Stauffenberg was shot down by a U.S. fighter{{citation needed date=December 2010}} near Straßkirchen, Bavaria. She crash-landed the aircraft and was conscious when civilians arrived to help. She asked for assistance to get out of the aircraft, and was extracted from the aircraft alive. The civilians reported her most serious injury appeared to be a broken leg. A local doctor, Hans Siegl from Straßkirchen, arrived at the scene but was told a military doctor had attended von Stauffenbergs injuries and his services were not needed. Von Stauffenbergs injuries did not appear life threatening, but she died two hours later. Her remains were taken to the hospital in Straubing, where the town mortuary book noted as the cause of death "...skull base fracture, tearing of the left thigh, fracture of the right ankle."
