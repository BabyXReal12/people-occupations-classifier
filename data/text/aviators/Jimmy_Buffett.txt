==Theater Works==
In 1994, Buffett began developing a musical based on Herman Wouks 1965 novel, Dont Stop the Carnival (novel) Dont Stop the Carnival.  Buffett wrote the music and lyrics and Wouk wrote the book for the show.  Dont Stop the Carnival debuted in Miami  Miami, Florida in 1997 to negative reviews from critics. In response, the producers approached Buffett and told him that Wouk needed to be fired and a more experienced playwright needed to rewrite Wouks script.  Buffett refused to remove Wouk from the project and any further productions of the show were canceled.  Buffett turned the show into an Dont Stop the Carnival (Jimmy Buffett album) album that was released in 1998.

A new musical, Escape to Margaritaville, opened at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego in May of 2017 and ran until July.  The show then performed limited runs in New Orleans, Houston, and Chicago, and was well-received by critics. The show features a book by Greg Garcia (producer) Greg Garcia and Mike OMalley and uses Buffetts classic songs, some of which he rewrote the lyrics to in order to better fit in the context of the story. The show began previews at the Marquis Theatre on Broadway theatre Broadway on February 16, 2018 and officially opened on March 15 under the direction of Tony Award Tony winner Christopher Ashley. The Broadway production received mixed reviews from New York critics.  In June that same year, the producers announced that the production would close on July 1 after 29 previews and 124 regular performances.  Along with the announcement of the shows Broadway closing, it was announced that a national tour will launch in Providence, Rhode Island in the fall of 2019. <ref name="Taffy" />

On November 23, 2004, Buffett raised funds with his "Surviving the Storm" Hurricane Relief Concert in Orlando, Florida to provide relief for hurricane victims in Florida, Alabama and the Caribbean affected by the four major hurricanes that year.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://homepage.mac.com/paperboy/blogwavestudio/LH20040529224556/LHA20041028052602/index.html  title=Jimmy Buffett: Surviving the Storm – Hurricane Benefit  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219131526/http://homepage.mac.com/paperboy/blogwavestudio/LH20040529224556/LHA20041028052602/index.html  archivedate=December 19, 2007  accessdate=May 28, 2014}}</ref>

Buffett performed in Hong Kong on January 18, 2008 for a concert that raised US$63,000 for the Foreign Correspondents Club Charity Fund. This was his first concert in Hong Kong and it sold out within weeks. Not only did Buffett perform for the groundlings for free, but he also paid for the concertgoers tequila and beer.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.thomascrampton.com/2008/01/31/jimmy-buffett-hong-kong-concert-organizers-apologize-to-buffett-fans/  title=Jimmy Buffett Hong Kong concert organizers apologize to Buffett fans  publisher=Thomas Crampton  date=2008-01-31  accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>

On July 11, 2010, Buffett, a Gulf Coast native, put on a free concert on the beach in Gulf Shores, Alabama. The concert was Buffetts response to the BP oil disaster in the Gulf. The concert was aired on Country Music Television CMT television. The 35,000 free tickets were given away within minutes to help draw people back to Alabamas beaches. Buffett played several popular songs including "Fins", "Son of a Son of a Sailor", "A Pirate Looks at Forty" and modified versions of "Margaritaville" (where the lyrics were changed in the chorus to "now I know, its all BPs fault") and "When the Coast is Clear" (the lyrics in the chorus also referencing the Deepwater Horizon disaster: "Thats when it always happens / When greed and crude collide"). The concert featured Jesse Winchester and Allen Toussaint.

==Controversy==
The earliest controversy with Buffett was his recording of "Gods Own Drunk" on the album Living and Dying in 3/4 Time. In 1983, the son of the late entertainer Lord Buckley sued Buffett for $11 million for copyright infringement, claiming that Buffett took parts of the monologue from Buckleys A Tribute to Buckley and claimed it as his own work in "Gods Own Drunk". The suit also alleged that Buffetts "blasphemous" rendition presented to the public a distorted impression of Lord Buckley.<ref>"Jimmy Buffett Sued Over Song" Miami Herald 30 August 1983: 1A.</ref> A court injunction against Buffett prevented him from performing the song until the lawsuit was settled or resolved, so starting in 1983, Buffett would get to the part of his show where he would normally perform "Gods Own Drunk", he would say that he was not allowed to play it because of the lawsuit and instead played a song he wrote called "The Lawyer and the Asshole" in which he accuses Buckleys son and lawyers as being greedy and tells them to "kiss his ass."

In January 1996, Buffetts Grumman HU-16 airplane named Hemisphere Dancer was shot at by Jamaican police, who believed the craft to be smuggling marijuana. The aircraft sustained minimal damage. The plane had previously been carrying Buffett, as well as U2s Bono, and Island Records producer Chris Blackwell, and co-pilot Bill Dindy, but they were not on board at the time. The Jamaican government acknowledged the mistake and apologized to Buffett, who penned the song "Jamaica Mistaica" for his Banana Wind album based on the experience. The plane from the incident is now at Orlando City Walks Margaritaville.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.buffettworld.com/widgeon-seaplane-crash/  title=Jimmy Buffett Crashes his Grumman Widgeon Seaplane " Jimmy Buffett World  publisher=Buffettworld.com  date=1994-08-25  accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1914&dat=19940826&id=7yQgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oGoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2680,5532930  title=Buffett Uninjured in Sea Plane Crash  accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref>

On February 4, 2001, he was ejected from the American Airlines Arena in Miami during a basketball game between the Miami Heat and the New York Knicks for cursing. After the game, referee Joe Forte said that he ordered him moved during the fourth quarter because "there was a little boy sitting next to him and a lady sitting by him. He used some words he knows he shouldnt have used." Forte apparently did not know who Buffett was, and censured Heat coach Pat Riley because he thought Riley—who was trying to explain to him who Buffett was—was insulting him by asking if he had ever been a "Parrothead", the nickname for Buffett fans.<ref name="buffettEjected">{{cite web  url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2001/02/05/Sports/Across.The.Wire-698290.shtml  title=Singer Buffett ejected from Knicks and Heat contest  accessdate=25 August 2007  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204108/http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2001/02/05/Sports/Across.The.Wire-698290.shtml  archivedate=September 30, 2007  df=mdy-all }}</ref> Buffett did not comment immediately after the incident, but discussed it on Today (NBC program) The Today Show three days later.

==Concerts and tours==

==="The Big 8" and standard songs===
Before 2003, songs played at every Buffett show were known as the Big&nbsp;8. With the success of the Alan Jackson duet "Its 5 OClock Somewhere", and the rising popularity of "One Particular Harbour", the list of songs played at every show went from 8 to 10. The "Big 8" were:
# "Margaritaville"
# "Come Monday"
# "Fins (song) Fins"
# "Volcano (Jimmy Buffett song) Volcano"
# "A Pirate Looks at Forty"
# "Cheeseburger in Paradise"
# "Why Dont We Get Drunk" — only played occasionally, as of 2018"
# "Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes (song) Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes"

Since "Why Dont We Get Drunk" has been knocked off the standards list,  only nine songs are played at almost every show in recent years. However, neither Buffett nor the Coral Reefers have ever used the term "Big&nbsp;9" for the new line-up.

This list does not necessarily mean that those songs have been played at every show. "A Pirate Looks at Forty" was not played during the George, Washington&nbsp;92 show.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.buffettworld.com/sl_1992.html#11  title=1992 - Recession Recess Tour  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040417012416/http://www.buffettworld.com/sl_1992.html  archivedate=2004-04-17  accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> "Cheeseburger in Paradise" was excluded from two setlists during the 1998 tour.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.buffettworld.com/sl_1998.html#11  title=1998 - Dont Stop the Carnival Tour  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040517123852/http://www.buffettworld.com/sl_1998.html  archivedate=2004-05-17  accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> "One Particular Harbour" was left out of 11 shows during the 1997 tour,<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.buffettworld.com/sl_1997.html#6  title=1997 - Havana Daydreamin Tour  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040805181743/http://buffettworld.com/sl_1997.html  archivedate=2004-08-05  accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> not to mention every show during the 1988 & 1989 tour.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.buffettworld.com/sl_1989.html  title=1989 Off To See The Lizard Tour  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031230235134/http://www.buffettworld.com/sl_1989.html  archivedate=2003-12-30  accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> "Why Dont We Get Drunk" was not played at all during the Bama Breeze tour, and has since only returned to be played on an occasional basis.

Other notable songs that are played at almost all shows are "Son of a Son of a Sailor (song) Son of a Son of a Sailor", Van Morrisons "Brown Eyed Girl" and Crosby, Stills and Nashs "Southern Cross (Crosby, Stills and Nash song) Southern Cross", bringing the total number of songs played at the vast majority of concerts since 2004 to 12.<ref>[https://www.setlist.fm/stats/jimmy-buffett-33d61029.html?tour=I+Don%27t+Know Setlist.fm - I Dont Know Tour 2016 Statistics]</ref>

In an interview on KLBJ radio in Austin, TX on May 2, 2013, Buffett humorously referred to the fact that they have to "play the ten that everyone wants, or else well get killed", and then went on to play "Its Five OClock Somewhere" on air. The set list for the event on May 3 at the Austin 360 Amphitheater, his first outdoor show in Austin in 17 years, did include the "ten". The show was one of the very few in Buffetts career that had ever been rescheduled on account of weather conditions (extreme wind in Austin forced the move to May 3 from the original date of May 2).

In the years 2010-2016, in 262 advertised appearances Buffett performed the song "Margaritaville" 248 times, "Son of a Son of a Sailor" 236, "Volcano" 235, "Changes in Attitudes" "235, "Come Monday" 235, "Fins" 232, "A Pirate Looks at 40" 232, "Cheeseburger in Pardise" 228, "Five OClock Somewhere" 225, "One Particular Harbor" 221, and "Southern Cross" 220. (Many of the appearances had short set lists such as guesting on television shows).<ref>[http://www.setlist.fm/stats/jimmy-buffett-33d61029.html?year=2016 Setlist.fm] {{webarchive  url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019043608/http://www.setlist.fm/stats/jimmy-buffett-33d61029.html?year=2016  date=October 19, 2016 }} Retrieved October 17, 2016.</ref>

===Tour accident===
On January 26, 2011 (Australia Day), Buffett was performing a concert in Australia at Sydneys Hordern Pavilion and fell off the stage after an encore. A concert-goer said, "He just went over to the edge of the stage, like he had numerous times through the night, just to wave, and people were throwing stuffed toys and things at him. And he just took one step too many and just disappeared in a flash. He didnt have time to put his arms out to save himself or anything, he just dropped."<ref name="Fulde"/><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/01/27/3122985.htm Jimmy Buffett doing well after stage fall] {{webarchive  url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405230739/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/01/27/3122985.htm  date=April 5, 2011 }}, 27 January 2011, ABC News Online.
