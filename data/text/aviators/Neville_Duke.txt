He was the most successful Western Allied ace in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations Mediterranean Theatre, and was credited with the destruction of 27 enemy aircraft. After the end of the war, Duke was acknowledged as one of the worlds foremost test pilots. In 1953, he became holder of the world air speed record when he flew a Hawker Hunter at {{convert 727.63 mph kph abbr=on}} over Littlehampton.

==Early life==
Duke was born in Tonbridge, Kent, and educated at the Convent of St Mary and The Judd School in Tonbridge. One of the four houses at Judd is now named after him, following the reinstating of a house system to the school in 2008. He started working as an auctioneer and estate agent before attempting to join the Fleet Air Arm on his 18th birthday.  He was rejected and joined the RAF instead as a cadet in June 1940.

==Second World War==
===Initial combat===
Duke underwent pilot training and was commissioned at No.&nbsp;58 Operational Training Unit, Grangemouth in February 1941, before being posted to No. 92 Squadron RAF No.&nbsp;92 Squadron at Biggin Hill in April, flying Supermarine Spitfire Mk Vs.  Operating over occupied Europe, Dukes obvious talents as a fighter pilot meant he often flew as wingman to Biggin Hills wing leader, Wing Commander Adolph Malan Adolph "Sailor" Malan. By August 1941, Duke had claimed two Messerschmitt Bf 109s shot down. When the unit was withdrawn for a rest in October 1941, Duke was posted to North Africa to fly with No. 112 Squadron RAF No.&nbsp;112 Squadron on the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk Curtiss Tomahawk.

On 30 November 1941, Duke was shot down by the high scoring German ace Oberfeldwebel Otto Schulz from Jagdgeschwader 27.<ref>Thomas 2005, pp. 18–19.</ref> On 5 December, he was again shot down by a pilot from JG 27. However, his own tally of victories continued to mount and, after the squadron was re-equipped with the more capable Curtiss P-40 Warhawk Curtiss Kittyhawk, by February 1942, Duke had at least eight victories, resulting in the award of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom) Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in March. These victories included a Fiat CR.42 and a Bf 109 on 20 and 21 December.<ref name="Thomas 2005, p. 15"/> He completed his first tour of operations the next month and then spent six months instructing at the fighter school in the Suez Canal Canal Zone.

In November 1942, Duke rejoined 92 Squadron, which has been transferred to North Africa flying the tropicalised Supermarine Spitfire Spitfire Mark V.<ref group=Note>For an explanation of different Spitfire marks, see Supermarine Spitfire variants</ref> He became a flight commander in February 1943 and received a Distinguished Service Order in March. By the end of his second tour in June, Duke had amassed a further 14 victories to his total and was awarded a Medal bar bar to his DFC.

Promoted to squadron leader, Duke was posted to No. 73 Operational Training Unit at Abu Sueir as chief flying instructor before returning to operations in March 1944 for his third tour, as commanding officer of No. 145 Squadron RAF No.&nbsp;145 Squadron in Italy, flying Supermarine Spitfire Spitfire Mk VIIIs. He claimed five more aircraft shot down in May, gaining a second bar to his DFC. On 7 June, Duke was shot down by flak and baled out into Lake Bracciano, almost drowning when unable to release his parachute harness. He sheltered with Italian partisans until U.S. troops arrived.

Downing two Focke-Wulf Fw 190 Fw 190s of Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933-1945)#Geschwader Schlachtgeschwader 4 in May, Duke scored his final kills on 7 September 1944, becoming the Mediterranean Theatres top Allied fighter ace at the age of 22.  In 486 sorties and some 712 operational hours, he claimed 27 outright victories and two shared, one probable, six damaged and two shared destroyed on the ground.<ref>Shores and Williams 1994, p. 234.</ref>

==Test pilot==
Duke returned to the UK and took up a position as test pilot for Hawker Aircraft Hawker in January 1945. He attended No 4 Course at the Empire Test Pilots School at Cranfield in 1946 and then joined the RAFs High Speed Flight RAF High Speed Flight unit, commanded by Edward Mortlock Donaldson Teddy Donaldson. It was Donaldson who set a new official world air speed record on 7 September 1946, later being the first official man to break the 1,000&nbsp;km/h barrier.  After demonstrating a Gloster Meteor at an air display in Prague, he was presented with the Czechoslovak War Cross 1939-1945 Czech War Cross for his wartime service.

Duke was awarded the Air Force Cross (United Kingdom) Air Force Cross recognising his test flying from 1947–1948 at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down, where he flew research flights to explore aircraft performance at high Mach numbers and high altitudes.  Duke resigned from the RAF in August 1948, joining the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, flying Spitfires and Meteors from Biggin Hill. He was CO of No. 615 Squadron RAF No.&nbsp;615 Squadron in 1950 and 1951, whose honorary air commodore was Winston Churchill.

Duke joined Hawker as an assistant chief test pilot in 1948, and became Hawkers chief test pilot in 1951, following the death of Trevor Sidney Wade "Wimpy" Wade, his predecessor.  He was particularly involved in the development of the highly successful Hawker Hunter, flying the Hawker Hunter Hawker P1067 in its trials in July 1951. He gave a display in the new fighter at the Farnborough Airshow on 6 September 1952, shortly after 1952 Farnborough Airshow DH.110 crash a prototype de Havilland DH 110, piloted by his friend John Derry, had broken up in flight, killing Derry and his observer Tony Richards, along with 28 spectators.  "My dear Duke", the Prime Minister wrote to him the next day, "it was characteristic of you to go up yesterday after the shocking accident. Accept my salute. Yours, in grief, Winston Churchill."

Duke was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in January 1953 for his contribution to supersonic flight and ground breaking achievements at Hawker. On 7 September 1953, Duke set a new Flight airspeed record world air speed record of {{convert 727.63 mi/h km/h abbr=on}}, flying Hunter WB188.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://speedrecordclub.com/records/outair.htm  title="Air Speed Records."  accessdate=2011-03-10  deadurl=bot: unknown  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013142357/http://speedrecordclub.com/records/outair.htm  archivedate=13 October 2007  df=dmy-all }} Outright Records via web.archive.org.

==Later life==
Duke married Gwendoline Fellows in 1947.

Duke took up freelance aviation consultancy work until 1960, when he formed Duke Aviation Limited.  He was Sir George Dowtys personal pilot for most of the 1960s and 1970s.  He sold the company in 1982. He also became a test pilot for Edgley Aircraft and later Brooklands Aircraft on the Edgley Optica and Brooklands Firemaster 65.

Duke wrote several books based on his experiences.  His autobiography, Test Pilot, was published in 1953 and reprinted in 1992.  His other books include The Sound Barrier (1953), The Crowded Sky (1959) and The War Diaries of Neville Duke (1995).  He was awarded the Royal Aero Clubs Gold Medal, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1993. In 2002, he received the Air Leagues Jeffrey Quill Medal and the Award of Honour from the Guild of Air Pilots and Navigators for "his unique and incomparable record".

Duke became one of the vice presidents of the Eagle Club, formed by the Eagle (comic) Eagle magazine, in 1950, and many schoolboys from that era came to know of Duke through this association.  It is speculated that "Dan Dare Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future" may have been inspired by Dukes achievements.<ref>[http://www.buzzle.com/articles/134079.html "Squadron Leader Neville Duke, Obituary: Fighter ace and record-breaking test pilot who played a key role in the development of the Hawker Hunter."]{{dead link date=September 2017  bot=InternetArchiveBot  fix-attempted=yes }} Guardian News & Media 2008 via Buzzle.com, 13 April 2007.

After three burglaries, Duke sold his war medals in 2006 when the costs of insuring them became prohibitive.  He denied press reports that he needed the money to pay for a hip operation for his wife Gwen.  On 7 April 2007, the couple were flying their private aircraft when Duke became ill. He landed safely at Popham Airfield, but collapsed as he left the aircraft. He was taken by ambulance to hospital in Basingstoke where he was diagnosed as suffering from an aneurysm. He was transferred to St Peters Hospital, Chertsey, Surrey, and died later that same evening after an operation, at the age of 85.
