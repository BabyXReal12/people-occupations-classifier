==Early life and education==
Christopher Reeve was born on September 25, 1952, in New York City, the son of Barbara Pitney Lamb (b. 1929), a journalist, and F. D. Reeve Franklin DOlier Reeve (1928-2013), a teacher, novelist, poet, and scholar. Reeve was of almost entirely English people English ancestry, with many family lines that had been in America since the early 1600s.<ref>{{cite book first=Lisa last=Birnbach title=True Prep: Its a Whole New Old World publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group location=New York City page=33 ISBN= 978-0-307-59398-6}}</ref> His paternal grandfather, Colonel Richard Henry Reeve, had been the Chief executive officer CEO of Prudential Financial (when it was called Prudential Life Insurance Company) for over 25 years.

Reeves father was a Princeton University graduate studying for a masters degree in Russian language Russian at Columbia University prior to the birth of his son, Christopher. Despite being born wealthy, Franklin Reeve spent summers working at the docks with stevedore longshoremen. Reeves mother had been a student at Vassar College but transferred to Barnard College to be closer to Franklin, whom she had met through a family connection. They had another son, Benjamin, born on October 6, 1953.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 54–58</ref>

Franklin and Barbara divorced in 1956, and she moved with her two sons to Princeton, New Jersey, where they attended Nassau Street School. Later that year, Franklin Reeve married Helen Schmidinger, a Columbia University graduate student. Barbara Pitney Lamb married Tristam B. Johnson, a stockbroker, in 1959. Johnson enrolled Christopher and his brother, Benjamin, in Princeton Country Day School, which later merged with Miss Fines School for Girls to become the co-educational Princeton Day School.<ref>{{cite book first=Libby last=Hughes url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jphd-qqGEgIC&lpg=PA21&dq=%22Princeton%20Day%20School%22&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q=%22Princeton%20Day%20School%22&f=false title=Christopher Reeve publisher=iUniverse location=Bloomington, Indiana date=2004 page=21 ISBN=9780595326075}}</ref> Reeve excelled academically, athletically, and onstage; he was on the Honors student honor roll and played soccer, baseball, tennis, and hockey. The sportsmanship award at Princeton Day Schools invitational hockey tournament was named in Reeves honor. Reeve admitted that he put pressure on himself to act older than he actually was in order to gain his fathers approval.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 58–68</ref>

Reeve found his passion for acting in 1962 at age nine when he was cast in an amateur version of the operetta The Yeomen of the Guard; it was the first of many student plays.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 70–71</ref> In mid-1968, at age fifteen, Reeve was accepted as an apprentice at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Williamstown, Massachusetts. The other apprentices were mostly college students, but Reeves older appearance and maturity helped him fit in with the others. In a workshop, he played a scene from A View from the Bridge that was chosen to be presented in front of an audience. After the performance, actress Olympia Dukakis said to him, "Im surprised. Youve got a lot of talent. Dont mess it up."<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 147–150</ref> The next summer, Reeve was hired at the Harvard Summer Repertory Theater Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts Cambridge for $44 per week. He played a Russian sailor in The Hostage (play) The Hostage and Belyayev in A Month in the Country (play) A Month in the Country. Famed theater critic Elliot Norton called his performance as Belyayev "startlingly effective." The 23-year-old lead actress in the play, a Carnegie Mellon graduate, turned out to be Reeves first romance. She was engaged to a fellow Carnegie Mellon graduate at the time; they mutually ended the relationship when he made a surprise visit to her dorm room at seven in the morning and found Reeve with her. Reeves romance with the actress fizzled a few months later when the age difference became an issue.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 152–154</ref> Reeve was briefly involved with Scientology but opted out of becoming a member. He subsequently voiced criticism of the organization.<ref>{{cite book   last = Reeve   first = Christopher   title = Nothing Is Impossible: Reflections on a New Life   edition = Hardcover  date=September 2002   publisher = Random House   isbn = 0-375-50778-7   chapter = Religion}}</ref><ref>{{cite news   last =Staff   title =Superman Christopher Reeve blasts Scientology   work =The Age   date =February 5, 2003}}</ref>

===Cornell===
After graduating from Princeton Day School in June 1970, Reeve acted in plays in Boothbay, Maine. He planned to go to New York City to find a career in theater. Ultimately, however, at the advice of his mother, he applied for college. He was accepted into Brown University Brown, Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon, Columbia University Columbia, Cornell University Cornell, Northwestern University Northwestern, and Princeton University Princeton. Reeve said that he chose Cornell primarily because it was distanced from New York City and because of the temptations of working as an actor immediately versus finishing college, as he had promised his mother and step-father.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), p 154</ref> Reeve joined the theater department in Cornell, and played Pozzo (Waiting for Godot) Pozzo in Waiting for Godot, Segismundo in Life is a Dream Life Is a Dream, Hamlet in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, and Polixenes in The Winters Tale.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 155–156</ref> 

Late in his freshman year, Reeve received a letter from Stark Hesseltine, a high-powered New York City agent who had discovered Robert Redford and who represented actors such as Richard Chamberlain, Michael Douglas, and Susan Sarandon. Hesseltine had seen Reeve in A Month in the Country and wanted to represent him. Reeve was very excited and kept re-reading the letter to make sure of what it said. Reeve was impatient with school and anxious to get on with his career. The two met, but Reeve was surprised to find that Hesseltine strongly supported his promise to his mother and step-father to complete college. They decided that instead of dropping out of school, Reeve would come to New York once a month to meet casting agents and producers to find work for the summer vacation.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 157–159</ref>

Reeve received favorable responses to his introductions and auditions arranged by Hesseltine but had to forgo several desirable opportunities because they began before school ended. That summer, he toured in a production of Forty Carats with Eleanor Parker.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 157–159</ref> The next year, Reeve received a full summer contract with the San Diego Shakespeare Festival, with roles as Edward IV in Richard III (play) Richard III, Fenton in The Merry Wives of Windsor, and Dumaine in Loves Labours Lost at the Old Globe Theatre.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 160–161</ref>

Before his third year of college, Reeve took a three-month leave of absence. He flew to Glasgow and saw theatrical productions throughout the United Kingdom. The actors inspired him, and he often had conversations with them in bars after the performances. He helped actors at the Old Vic with their American accents by reading the newspaper aloud for them. He then flew to Paris, where he spoke fluent French for his entire stay: he had studied it from third grade until his second year in Cornell. He watched many performances and immersed himself in the culture before finally returning to New York to reunite with his girlfriend.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 162–166</ref>

===Juilliard===
After returning to the U.S. from Europe, Reeve chose to focus solely on acting, although Cornell University had several general education requirements for graduation that he had yet to complete. He managed to convince theater director Jim Clause and the Dean (education) dean of the College of Arts and Sciences that, as a theater major, he would achieve more at Juilliard School Juilliard (List of Juilliard School people Group 4, 1973–1975) than at Cornell. They agreed that his first year at Juilliard would be counted as his senior year at Cornell.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), p 167</ref>

In 1973, approximately 2000 students auditioned for 20 places in the freshman class at Juilliard. Reeves audition was in front of 10 faculty members, including John Houseman, who had just won an Academy Award for The Paper Chase (film) The Paper Chase. Reeve and Robin Williams were the only students selected for Juilliards Advanced Program.<ref>Walker, Andrew. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/1849218.stm "Christopher Reeve: Living in hope"] BBC News, March 1, 2002, accessed November 19, 2006</ref> They had several classes together in which they were the only students. In their dialects class with Edith Skinner, Williams had no trouble mastering all dialects naturally, whereas Reeve was more meticulous about it. Williams and Reeve developed a close friendship.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1501), pp 167–172</ref>

In a meeting with John Houseman, Reeve was told, "Mr. Reeve. It is terribly important that you become a serious classical actor. Unless, of course, they offer you a shitload of money to do something else."<ref name=HoltReeve>Holt, Patricia. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1998/05/11/DD55495.DTL Reeve is Superman For Real: Actors memoir filled with humor and courage.] San Francisco Chronicle, May 11, 1998, accessed November 20, 2006</ref> Houseman then offered him the chance to leave school and join the Acting Company, among performers such as Kevin Kline, Patti LuPone, and David Ogden Stiers. Reeve declined, as he had not yet received his bachelors degree from Juilliard.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 172–173</ref>

In early 1974, Reeve and other Juilliard students toured the New York City junior high school system and performed The Love Cure. In one performance, Reeve, who played the hero, drew his sword out too high and accidentally destroyed a row of lights above him. The students applauded and cheered. Reeve later said that this was the greatest ovation of his career.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 173–174</ref> After completing his first year at Juilliard, Reeve graduated from Cornell in the Class of 74.

In late 1975, he auditioned for the Broadway theatre Broadway play A Matter of Gravity. Katharine Hepburn watched his audition and cast him as her characters grandson in the play. With Hepburns influence over the CBS network, Reeve worked out the schedules of the soap opera Love of Life and the play so that he would be able to do both. Because of his busy schedule, he ate candy bars and drank coffee in place of meals and hence suffered from exhaustion and malnutrition. On the first night of the plays run, Reeve entered the stage, said his first line, and then promptly fainted. Hepburn turned to the audience and said, "This boys a goddamn fool. He doesnt eat enough red meat." The understudy finished the play for Reeve, and a doctor treated him. The doctor advised Reeve to eat a more healthful diet. He stayed with the play throughout its year-long run and was given very favorable reviews. He and Hepburn became very close. She said, "Youre going to be a big star, Christopher, and support me in my old age." He replied, "I cant wait that long." Some gossip columns rumored a romance between the two. Reeve said, "She was sixty-seven and I was twenty-two, but I thought that was quite an honor...I believe I was fairly close to what a child or grandchild might have been to her." Reeve said that his father, who was a professor of literature and came to many of the performances, was the man who most captivated Hepburn. When the play moved to Los Angeles, California Los Angeles in 1976, Reeve&nbsp;— to Hepburns disappointment&nbsp;— dropped out. They stayed in touch for years after the plays run. Reeve later regretted not staying closer and just sending messages back and forth.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 179–186</ref>

Reeves first role in a Hollywood film was a very small part as a junior submarine officer in the 1978 naval disaster movie Gray Lady Down. He then acted in the play My Life at the Circle Repertory Company with friend William Hurt.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 187–188</ref>

==Career==
===Superman===
<!--File:Clarksupescompare.jpg thumb right Reeve as both Superman (left) and Clark Kent (right)-->
During My Life, Stark Hesseltine told Reeve that he had been asked to audition for the leading role as Clark Kent/Superman in the big budget film, Superman (1978 film) Superman (1978). Lynn Stalmaster, the casting director, put Reeves picture and résumé on the top of the pile three separate times, only to have the producers throw it out each time. Through Stalmasters persistent pleading, a meeting between director Richard Donner, producer Ilya Salkind, and Reeve was set in January 1977 at the Sherry Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 188–189</ref> The morning after the meeting, Reeve was sent a 300-page script. He was thrilled that the script took the subject matter seriously, and that Richard Donners motto was verisimilitude. Reeve immediately flew to London for a screen test, and on the way was told that Marlon Brando was going to play Jor-El and Gene Hackman was going to play Lex Luthor. Reeve still did not think he had much of a chance. Though standing {{convert 6 ft 4 in cm abbr=on}}, he was a self-described "skinny White Anglo-Saxon Protestant WASP." On the plane ride to London, he imagined how his approach to the role would be. He later said, "By the late 1970s, the masculine image had changed... Now it was acceptable for a man to show gentleness and vulnerability. I felt that the new Superman ought to reflect that contemporary male image." He based his portrayal of Clark Kent on Cary Grant in his role in Bringing Up Baby. After the screen test, his driver said, "Im not supposed to tell you this, but youve got the part."<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 195–197</ref>

Reeve was a talented all-around athlete.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.chrisreevehomepage.com/biography.html  title=Christopher Reeve biography publisher=Chrisreevehomepage.com  date=  accessdate=July 9, 2013}}</ref> Portraying the role of Superman would be a stretch for the young actor, but he was tall enough for the role and had the necessary blue eyes and handsome features. However, his physique was slim. He refused to wear fake muscles under the suit and instead went through an intense two-month training regimen that former British weightlifting champion David Prowse supervised. Prowse played Darth Vader in the suit in the original Star Wars films. The training regimen consisted of running in the morning, followed by two hours of Weight training weightlifting and ninety minutes on the trampoline. In addition, Reeve doubled his food intake and adopted a high protein diet. He added {{convert 30 lb kg spell=in}} of muscle to his thin {{convert 189 lb kg}} frame. He later made even higher gains for Superman III (1983), though for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), he decided it would be healthier to focus more on cardiovascular workouts.<ref>Harrington, OConnor and Kavitsky, [http://www.chrisreevehomepage.com/m-movie1.html Superman (1978)], Christopher Reeve Homepage, accessed October 10, 2006</ref> One of the reasons Reeve could not work out as much for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace was an emergency appendectomy he had in June 1986. <ref>Rossen, Jake.

Dunlap. "NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; Appendectomy Centenary." The New York Times. The New York Times Company, 26 Jun. 1986. Web. 16 Aug. 2018.</ref>

Reeve was never a Superman or comic book fan, though he had watched Adventures of Superman (TV series) Adventures of Superman starring George Reeves. Reeve found the role offered a suitable challenge because it was a dual role. He said, "there must be some difference stylistically between Clark and Superman. Otherwise, you just have a pair of glasses standing in for a character."<ref>Bergan, Ronald. [http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,12589,1325258,00.html Christopher Reeve.] The Guardian, October 12, 2004, accessed November 20, 2006</ref><ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), p 200</ref>

On the commentary track for the directors edition of Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz spoke of how Reeve had talked to him about playing Superman and then playing Clark Kent. Mankiewicz then corrected Reeve, telling him that he was always, always playing Superman and that when he was Clark Kent, he was "playing Superman who was playing Clark Kent." Mankiewicz described it to Reeve as a role within the role.

The film grossed $300,218,018 worldwide (unadjusted for inflation).<ref>Box Office Mojo, [http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=superman.htm Superman (1978)], accessed October 23, 2006</ref> Reeve received positive reviews for his performance:
* "Christopher Reeves entire performance is a delight. Ridiculously good-looking, with a face as sharp and strong as an ax blade, his bumbling, fumbling Clark Kent and omnipotent Superman are simply two styles of gallantry and innocence."&nbsp;– Newsweek
* "Christopher Reeve has become an instant international star on the basis of his first major movie role, that of Clark Kent/Superman. Film reviewers&nbsp;— regardless of their opinion of the film&nbsp;— have been almost unanimous in their praise of Reeves dual portrayal. He is utterly convincing as he switches back and forth between personae."&nbsp;– Starlog
* Won a BAFTA Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles.

Christopher Reeve also guest starred in Smallville, the successful American television show about Clark Kent/Supermans childhood. He appeared as Doctor Virgil Swann, who helped Clark Kent understand his heritage. Reeve appeared as Doctor Swann in Seasons 2 and 3, until the character was ultimately "killed off". He appeared in two episodes titled "Rosetta" and "Legacy", while his death was made known in the fourth-season episode "Sacred".

Reeve used his celebrity status for several philanthropic causes. Through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, he visited terminally ill children. He joined the Board of Directors for the worldwide charity Save the Children. In 1979, he served as a track and field coach at the Special Olympics alongside O. J. Simpson.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), p 201</ref>

====Sequels====
Much of Superman II was filmed at the same time as the Superman (1978 film) first film. After most of the footage had been shot, the producers had a disagreement with director Richard Donner over various matters, including money and special effects, and they mutually parted ways. Film director Richard Lester, who had worked with the producers previously on the two-parter The Three Musketeers (1973) and The Four Musketeers (1974 film) The Four Musketeers (1974), replaced Donner. Lester had the script changed and re-shot some footage. The cast was unhappy, but Reeve later said that he liked Lester and considered Superman II to be his favorite of the series.<ref name=Reeve201203>Reeve, Christopher (1898), pp 201–203</ref> Because of fan encouragement and the June 2006 theatrical release of Superman Returns, Richard Donners version of Superman II titled Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, was released on DVD in Nov. 2006, at the same time as the DVD release of Superman Returns. Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut was dedicated in memory of Reeve.

Lester directed Superman III, released in 1983, solo. Reeve believed that producers Alexander Salkind, his son Ilya Salkind, and Pierre Spengler decreased the credibility of Superman III by turning it into a Richard Pryor comedy and hence making it a not very good film. He missed Richard Donner and believed that Superman IIIs only really good element was the automobile wrecking yard junkyard scene in which Evil Superman fights Good Clark Kent in an internal battle.<ref name=Reeve201203/> Reeves portrayal of the Evil Superman was highly praised, though the film was critically panned. Any negative review for Superman III, however, was nothing compared to the totally negative reception its Superman IV: The Quest for Peace successor would receive.

Superman IV: The Quest for Peace was released in 1987. After Superman III, Reeve vowed that he was done with Superman.<ref>Cosford, Bill.

Accessed November 19, 2006</ref> However, he agreed to continue the role in a fourth film on the condition that he would have partial creative control over the script. The nuclear disarmament plot was his idea. Cannon Films purchased the production rights to the character of Superman from Alexander Salkind and his son Ilya Salkind, the original producers of the film series, in the mid-1980s.<ref>Harper, Oliver.

The film was both a critical failure and a box office bomb box office disappointment, becoming the lowest grossing Superman in film Superman film to date. Reeve later said, "the less said about Superman IV the better."<ref name=Reeve201203/> Both of Reeves children from his relationship with Gae Exton had uncredited appearances in a deleted scene in which Superman rescues a girl, played by his daughter Alexandra, and reunites her with her brother, played by his son Matthew, after Nuclear Man creates a tornado in Smallville (comics) Smallville.

Reeve would have made a fifth Superman film after the rights to the character reverted to Alexander Salkind, Ilya Salkind, and Pierre Spengler if said film had a budget the same size as that of Superman (1978 film) Superman: The Movie. Although there was potential for such a film in the late 1980s after Cannon Films went bankruptcy bankrupt, Reeve never received any script.<ref>capedwonder.superman.

===1980–1986===
<!--File:Somewhere in Time scene.jpg thumb upright With Jane Seymour in Somewhere in Time (1980)-->
Reeves first role after 1978s Superman (1978 film) Superman was as Richard Collier in the 1980 romance film romantic fantasy Somewhere in Time (film) Somewhere in Time. Jane Seymour (actress) Jane Seymour played Elise McKenna, his love interest. The film was shot on Mackinac Island in mid-1979 and was Reeves favorite film ever to shoot. After the film was completed, the plan was for a limited release and to build word of mouth, but early test screenings were favorable and the studio decided on a wide release, which ultimately proved to be the wrong strategy. Early reviews savaged the film as overly sentimental and melodramatic, and an actors strike action strike prevented Reeve and Seymour from doing publicity. The film quickly closed, although Jean-Pierre Dorléac was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design in 1980. The film, commercially unsuccessful, was Reeves first public disappointment. Almost 10 years after Somewhere in Time (film) Somewhere in Time was released, it became a cult film, thanks to screenings on cable networks and video rentals; its popularity began to grow, vindicating the belief of the creative team. INSITE, the International Network of Somewhere in Time Enthusiasts, did fundraising to sponsor a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1997 for Reeve. Jane Seymour became a personal friend of Reeve and in 1996 named one of her twin sons Kristopher in his honor.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 204–207</ref>

In that same year, he made a guest appearance on The Muppet Show, where he performed "East of the Sun (and West of the Moon)" on a piano for Miss Piggy, who had a limerence crush on him. Reeve denied being Superman but displayed the superpowers throughout that entire episode. He then returned to continue filming on the not yet finished production of Superman II.

Gae Exton, Reeves partner at the time, gave birth to their son, Matthew Reeve Matthew Exton Reeve, on December 20, 1979, at Welbeck Hospital in London, England. After finishing Superman II, the family left London and rented a house in Hollywood Hills. Soon after, Reeve grew tired of Hollywood and took the family to Williamstown, Massachusetts, where he played the lead in the successful play The Front Page, directed by Robert Allan Ackerman. Later in the year, Reeve played a disabled Vietnam veteran in the Broadway play Fifth of July. In his research for the role, he was coached by an amputee on how to walk on artificial legs.<ref name=Reeve207212>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 207–212</ref>

After Fifth of July, Reeve stretched his acting range further and played a homicidal novice playwright trying to kill his lover and mentor Michael Caine in Sidney Lumets dark comedy film Deathtrap (film) Deathtrap based on the play by Ira Levin. The film was well received. After Superman II, Reeve portrayed partially corrupt Catholic priest John Flaherty in Monsignor (film) Monsignor. Reeve felt this gave him the opportunity to play "a morally ambiguous character who was neither clearly good nor clearly bad, someone to whom life is much more complex than the characters Ive played previously".<ref name="Christopher Reeve Homepage">[http://www.chrisreevehomepage.com/m-monsignor.html Christopher Reeve Homepage]</ref> Reeve blamed the failure of the film on poor editing. He said "the movie is sort of a series of outrageous incidents that you find hard to believe. Since they dont have a focus, and since they arent justified and explained, they become laughable".<ref name="Christopher Reeve Homepage"/>

Reeve was then offered the role of Basil Ransom in The Bostonians (film) The Bostonians alongside Vanessa Redgrave. Though Reeve ordinarily commanded over one million dollars per film, the producers could only afford to pay him one-tenth of that. Reeve had no complaints, as he was happy to be doing a role of which he could be proud. The film exceeded expectations and did very well at the box office for what was considered to be an art film art house film. The New York Times called it "the best adaptation of a literary work yet made for the screen."<ref name=Reeve207212/> Katharine Hepburn called Reeve to tell him that he was "absolutely marvelous" and "captivating" in the film. When he told her that he was currently shooting Anna Karenina (1985 film) Anna Karenina, she said, "Oh, thats a terrible mistake."<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), p 183</ref>

Reeve was a licensed aircraft pilot pilot and flew solo across the Atlantic twice. During the filming of Superman III, he raced his sailplane in his free time. He joined The Tiger Club, a group of aviators who had served in the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain. They let him participate in mock dogfights in vintage World War I combat airplane planes. The producers of the film The Aviator (1985 film) The Aviator approached him without knowing that he was a pilot and that he knew how to fly a Stearman Aircraft Stearman, the plane used in the film. Reeve readily accepted the role. The film was shot in Kranjska Gora, and Reeve did all his own stunts. At this time, Gae Exton gave birth to their second child, Alexandra Exton Reeve, in December 1983 at London Welbeck Hospital Welbeck Hospital in London, England.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 216–219</ref>

In 1984, Reeve appeared in The Aspern Papers with Vanessa Redgrave. He then played Tony in The Royal Family (play) The Royal Family and the Count in Marriage of Figaro, a very notability famous opera buffa by Mozart.

In 1985, Reeve hosted the television documentary Dinosaur! Fascinated with dinosaurs since he was a kid, as he says in the documentary, he flew himself to New York in his own plane to shoot on location at the American Museum of Natural History. Also, in 1985, DC Comics named Reeve as one of the honorees in the companys 50th-anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great for his work on the Superman film series.<ref>{{Cite comic  writer = Marx, Barry  cowriters = Joey Cavalieri Cavalieri, Joey and Hill, Thomas  artist = Petruccio, Steven   editor = Marx, Barry  story = Christopher Reeve Superman Becomes a Blockbuster  title = Fifty Who Made DC Great  date = 1985  publisher = DC Comics  page = 44  panel =   id = }}</ref>

In 1986, he was still struggling to find scripts that he liked. A script named Street Smart (film) Street Smart had been lying in his house for years, and after re-reading it, he had Cannon Films green-light it. He starred opposite Morgan Freeman, who was nominated for his first Academy Award for the film. The film received excellent reviews but performed poorly at the box office, possibly because Cannon Films had failed to properly advertise it.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 221–224, 228</ref>

===1987–1989===
After Superman IV in 1987, Reeves relationship with Exton fell apart, and they separated. He moved to New York City New York without his children. He became depression (mood) depressed and decided that doing a comedy might be good for him. He was given a lead in Switching Channels. Burt Reynolds and Kathleen Turner had a feud during filming, which made the time even more unbearable for Reeve. Reeve later stated that he made a fool of himself in the film and that most of his time was spent refereeing between Reynolds and Turner. The film did poorly, and Reeve believed that it marked the end of his movie star career. He spent the next years mostly doing plays. He tried out for the Richard Gere role in Pretty Woman but walked out on the audition because they had a half-hearted casting director fill in for Julia Roberts.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 225–231</ref>

Five months after separating from Gae Exton and after filming Switching Channels, he went back to Williamstown with his children, Matthew and Alexandra, who were seven and three respectively. Reeve watched a group of singers called the Cabaret Corps perform, and took notice of one of the singers, Dana Reeve Dana Morosini. The two began dating and were married in Williamstown in April 1992.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 82–94</ref>

In the late 1980s, Reeve became more active. He was taking horse-riding lessons and trained five to six days a week for competition in combined training events. He built a sailboat, The Sea Angel, and sailed from the Chesapeake Bay Chesapeake to Nova Scotia. He campaigned for Senator Patrick Leahy and made speeches throughout the state. He served as a board member for the Charles Lindbergh Fund, which promotes environmentally safe technologies. He lent support to causes such as Amnesty International, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and People for the American Way. He joined the Environmental Air Force and used his Cheyenne II turboprop plane to take government officials and journalists over areas of environmental damage. In late 1987, in Santiago, Chile, the countrys dictator, Augusto Pinochet, threatened to execute 77 actors. Ariel Dorfman asked Reeve to help save their lives. Reeve flew to Chile and helped lead a protest march. A cartoon then ran in a newspaper showing him carrying Pinochet by the collar with the caption, "Where will you take him, Superman?" For his heroics, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Bernardo OHiggins Order, the highest Chilean award distinction for foreigners. He also received the Obie Prize and the Annual Walter Brielh Human Rights Foundation award.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.falkland-malvinas.com/Detalle.asp?NUM=3192  title=Chile honours Christopher Reeve, Superman  publisher=Falkland-malvinas.com  date=  accessdate=July 9, 2013}}</ref> Reeves friend Ron Silver later started the Creative Coalition, an organization designed to teach celebrities how to speak knowledgeably about political issues. Reeve was an early member of the group, along with Susan Sarandon, Alec Baldwin, and Blythe Danner.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 235–239</ref>

===1990–1994===
In 1990, Reeve starred in the Civil War film The Rose and the Jackal, in which he played Allan Pinkerton, the head of President of the United States President Abraham Lincoln Lincolns new Secret Service. Dana gave birth to William Elliot "Will" Reeve on June 7, 1992, at North Adams Regional Hospital in North Adams, Massachusetts. In October, Reeve was offered the part of Lewis in The Remains of the Day (film) The Remains of the Day. The screenplay script was one of the best he had read, and he unhesitatingly took the part. The film was deemed an instant classic and was nominated for eight Academy Awards.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 232–235</ref>

In the early 1990s, Reeve was in three roles for television in which he was cast as a villain.<ref name="Christopher Reeve home page">[http://www.chrisreevehomepage.com/m-bumpnight.html Christopher Reeve home page]</ref> The most notable of these was Bump in the Night based on the novel by Isabelle Holland in which Reeve played a child molester who abducts a young boy in New York City. The movie got fair to positive reviews.<ref>Weiskind, Ron. "Bump" Stars Go Against Type. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, January 4, 1991.

It is on home video in the UK, but not in the US.<ref name="Christopher Reeve home page"/>

In another television movie, Mortal Sins (1992), Reeve for the second time played a Catholic priest, this time hearing the confessions of a serial murderer in a role reminiscent of that of Montgomery Clift in Hitchcocks I Confess (film) I Confess.

In 1994, Reeve was elected as a co-president of the Creative Coalition. The organizations work was noticed nationwide, and the Democratic Party (United States) Democratic Party asked Reeve to run for the United States Congress. He replied, "Run for Congress? And lose my influence in Washington?" At this time, he had received scripts for Picket Fences and Chicago Hope and was asked by CBS if he wanted to start his own television series. This meant moving to Los Angeles, which would place him even further from Matthew and Alexandra, who lived in London. In Massachusetts, Reeve could take a Concorde and see them anytime. He declined the offers. Reeve did not mind making trips, however; he went to New Mexico to shoot Speechless (1994 film) Speechless, co-starring Michael Keaton who, like Reeve, also portrayed a famous DC Comics superhero on film: Batman. Reeve then went to Point Reyes to shoot John Carpenters film Village of the Damned (1995 film) Village of the Damned, a remake of a 1960 British movie of the same name. Both of these films with this title were based on the 1957 novel The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham.<ref>"The Midwich Cuckoos." Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, 24 Jul. 2018. Web. 17 Aug. 2018.</ref>

Shortly before his accident, Reeve played a paralyzed police officer in the HBO movie Above Suspicion (1995 film) Above Suspicion. He did research at a Physical medicine and rehabilitation rehabilitation hospital in Van Nuys and learned how to use a wheelchair to get in and out of cars. Reeve was then offered the lead in Kidnapped (1995 film) Kidnapped, to be shot in Ireland. He was excited to be going to Ireland, and he and Dana decided that they would conceive their second child there. Reeve also planned to direct his first big screen film, a romantic comedy entitled Tell Me True. Not long after making these plans, the family went to Culpeper, Virginia, for an equestrian competition.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 240–242</ref>

===Roles turned down by Reeve===

====1978–1984====
Following the first Superman movie, Reeve realized that Hollywood producers wanted him to be an action star. He later said, "I found most of the scripts of that genre poorly constructed, and I felt the starring roles could easily be played by anyone with a strong physique." In addition, he did not feel that he was right for the other films he was offered and turned down the lead roles in American Gigolo, The World According to Garp (film) The World According to Garp, Splash (film) Splash, Fatal Attraction, Pretty Woman, Romancing the Stone, Lethal Weapon, and Body Heat. Katharine Hepburn recommended Reeve to David Lean for the role of Fletcher Christian in The Bounty (1984 film) The Bounty, a film version of Mutiny on the Bounty starring Anthony Hopkins. After considering it, Reeve decided that he would be miscast, and Lean went with his second choice, Mel Gibson.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 203–204</ref>

====2001====
Prior to the filming of Hannibal (film) Hannibal, Reeve was offered the part of primary antagonist Mason Verger, based on his work as a wheelchair-using police officer in Above Suspicion (1995 film) Above Suspicion. Not having read Hannibal (Harris novel) the novel, Reeve was initially enthusiastic about the opportunity. However, upon realizing that Verger was a quadriplegic, facially disfigured child rapist, Reeve withdrew from the project in disgust. The role was accepted by secondary choice Gary Oldman.<ref>{{cite journal last=Llenden first=Joseph date=June 2003 title=You Offered Me What?!

==Injury==
{{see also Superman curse}}
Reeve began his involvement in horse riding in 1985 after learning to ride for the film Anna Karenina (1985 film) Anna Karenina. He was initially allergic to horses, so he took antihistamines. He trained on Marthas Vineyard, and by 1989, he began eventing. His allergies soon disappeared.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 6–9</ref> He had suffered leg injuries as a teen while skiing, and he later broke three ribs in a riding accident he described, along with the leg injuries, on The Tonight Show in March 1987.

Reeve purchased a 12-year-old American thoroughbred horse named Eastern Express, nicknamed "Buck" while filming Village of the Damned (1995 film) Village of the Damned. He trained with Buck in 1994 and planned to do Training Level events in 1995 and move up to Preliminary in 1996. Though Reeve had originally signed up to compete at an event in Vermont, his coach invited him to go to the Commonwealth Dressage and Combined Training Association finals at the Commonwealth Park equestrian center in Culpeper, Virginia. Reeve finished in fourth place out of 27 in the dressage, before walking his cross-country course. He was concerned about jumps 16 and 17 but paid little attention to the third jump, which was a routine three-foot-three fence shaped like the letter W.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 14–18</ref>

On May 27, 1995, Reeves horse made a Refusal (horse) refusal. Witnesses said that the horse began the third fence jump and suddenly stopped. Reeve fell forward off the horse, holding on to the reins. His hands somehow became tangled in the reins, and the bridle and Horse tack#Bits bit were pulled off the horse. He landed head first on the far side of the fence, shattering his Atlas (anatomy) first and Axis (anatomy) second vertebrae. This cervical spinal injury, which paralysis paralyzed him from the neck down,<ref>Romano, Lois. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A99660-1995Jun1.html Riding Accident Paralyzes Actor Christopher Reeve.] Washington Post, June 1, 1995, pg. A01. Accessed November 19, 2006</ref> also halted his breathing. Paramedics arrived three minutes later and immediately took measures to get air into his lungs. He was taken first to the local hospital, before being flown by helicopter to the University of Virginia Health System University of Virginia Medical Center.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 18–25</ref> Afterwards, he had no recollection of the accident. Because of Reeves injury, Armand Assante replaced him for the role of Alan Breck Stewart in Kidnapped (1995 film) Kidnapped.

===Recovery===
For the first few days after the accident, Reeve suffered from delirium, woke up sporadically and would mouth words to Dana such as "Get the gun" and "Theyre after us." After five days, he regained full consciousness, and his doctor explained to him that he had destroyed his first and second cervical vertebrae, which meant that his skull and spine were not connected. His lungs were filling with fluid and were suctioned by entry through the throat; this was said to be the most painful part of Reeves recovery.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 27–30</ref>

After considering his situation, believing that not only would he never walk again, but that he might never move a body part again, Reeve considered suicide. He mouthed to Dana, "Maybe we should let me go." She tearfully replied, "I am only going to say this once: I will support whatever you want to do because this is your life, and your decision. But I want you to know that Ill be with you for the long haul, no matter what. Youre still you. And I love you." Reeve never considered euthanasia as an option again.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), p 32</ref><ref>Crews, Chip. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/reeve.htm The Role He Cant Escape.] Washington Post, May 3, 1998, accessed November 19, 2006</ref>

Reeve went through inner anguish in the Intensive care unit ICU, particularly when he was alone during the night. His approaching operation to reattach his skull to his spine in June 1995 "was frightening to contemplate. ... I already knew that I had only a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the surgery. ... Then, at an especially bleak moment, the door flew open and in hurried a squat fellow with a blue scrub hat and a yellow surgical gown and glasses, speaking in a Russian accent." The man announced that he was a proctologist and was going to perform a rectal exam on Reeve. It was Robin Williams, reprising his character from the film Nine Months. Reeve wrote: "For the first time since the accident, I laughed. My old friend had helped me know that somehow I was going to be okay."<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), p 36</ref>

Dr. John A. Jane performed surgery to repair Reeves neck vertebrae. He put wires underneath both Lamina of the vertebral arch laminae and used bone from Reeves hip to fit between the C1 and C2 vertebrae. He inserted a titanium pin and fused the wires with the vertebrae, then drilled holes in Reeves skull and fitted the wires through to secure the skull to the spinal column.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), p 37</ref>

===Rehabilitation===
On June 28, 1995, Reeve was taken to the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation Kessler Rehabilitation Center in West Orange, New Jersey. He was given several blood transfusions in the first few weeks because of very low hemoglobin and protein levels. Many times his Medical ventilator breathing tube would become disconnected and he would be at the mercy of nurses to come in and save his life.<ref name=HoltReeve/>

At the Institute, one of his aides was a Jamaican man named Glenn Miller, nicknamed Juice, who helped him learn how to get into the shower and how to use a powered wheelchair, which was activated by blowing air through a straw. Miller and Reeve would watch the film Cool Runnings and joke about Reeve directing the sequel, Bobsled Two.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 98–109</ref>

Whilst in Israel, Reeve had shown significant improvement to his condition. Earlier, he had shown skill ability to move his left hand index finger, later progressing further by regaining back ability to move his arms and legs to a certain extent.<ref>{{cite news  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/12/us/actor-regains-some-movement-doctor-says.html?nytmobile=0  title=Actor Regains Some Movement, Doctor Says  last=Blakeslee  first=Sandra  date=September 12, 2002  work=The New York Times  access-date=July 16, 2018}}</ref>

Throughout his intensive tour, Reeve visited Sheba Medical Center, ALYN Hospital, Weizmann Institute of Science, and Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, among many other places. After meeting dozens of Israeli patients who had undergone groundbreaking recovery processes and made remarkable progress, Reeve was in awe<ref name="BBC" /> and described the feeling as "almost overwhelming". He explained, "The research progresses more rapidly in Israel than almost anywhere else I can think of. The decision they made about stem cells, where they had a debate and decided that secular law must prevail over religious teachings, is something that we need to learn in the United States."<ref name="YouTube">{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keNu6kHg2T8  title=Christopher Reeve: Trip to Israel July 2003  publisher=Youtube.com  date=November 3, 2008  accessdate=July 9, 2013}}</ref>

Reeve discussed his trip to Israel on CNNs Larry King Live while he was in Tel Aviv. When asked what Israel is doing that other countries are not, Reeve responded, "They have a very progressive atmosphere here. They have socialized medicine so that doctors and patients do not have the problem of profit or trying to get insurance companies to pay for treatment. They also work very well together. They share their knowledge. This is a country of six million people about the size of Long Island, and everyone works together very tremendously.

==Activism==
Reeve left Kessler feeling inspiration from the other patients he had met. Because the mass media media was constantly covering him,, he decided to use his name to put focus on Spinal cord injury spinal cord injuries. In 1996, he appeared at the 68th Academy Awards Academy Awards to a long standing ovation and gave a speech about Hollywoods duty to make movies that face the worlds most important issues head-on. He also hosted the Paralympics in Atlanta and spoke at the Democratic National Convention. He traveled across the country to make speeches, never needing a teleprompter or a script. For these efforts, he was placed on the cover of Time (magazine) TIME on August 26, 1996.<ref>{{cite news author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page  url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,26-08-1996,00.html  title=TIME Magazine Cover: Christopher Reeve publisher=Time.com  date=August 26, 1996  accessdate=July 9, 2013}}</ref> In the same year, he narrated the HBO film Without Pity: A Film About Abilities.

==Career after the accident==
In 1997, Reeve made his directorial debut with the HBO film In the Gloaming (film) In the Gloaming with Robert Sean Leonard, Glenn Close, Whoopi Goldberg, Bridget Fonda, and David Strathairn. The film won four Cable Ace Awards and was nominated for five Emmy Awards including "Outstanding Director for a Miniseries or Special". Dana Reeve said, "Theres such a difference in his outlook, his health, his overall sense of well-being when hes working at what he loves, which is creative work."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=chris-reeve  title=Christopher Reeve Biography  publisher=Supermanhomepage.com  date=  accessdate=July 9, 2013}}</ref> In 1998, Reeve produced and starred in Rear Window (1998 film) Rear Window, a remake of Alfred Hitchcocks Rear Window 1954 film.

Throughout this time, Reeve kept his body as physically strong as possible by using specialized exercise machines. He did this both because he believed that intense physical therapy could regeneration (biology) regenerate the nervous system, and because he wanted his body to be strong enough to support itself if a cure was found. In 2000, he began to regain some motor control motor function, and he was able to sense hot and cold temperatures on his body. His doctor, John McDonald of Washington University in St. Louis, asked him if anything was new with his recovery. Reeve then moved his left index finger on command. "I dont think Dr. McDonald would have been more surprised if I had just walked on water," said Reeve in an interview.<ref>{{cite news author=Oliver Burkeman  url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,793417,00.html  title=Man of steel  publisher=Guardian  date=September 17, 2002  accessdate=July 9, 2013  location=London}}</ref> Also, during that year, he made guest appearances on the long-running PBS series Sesame Street.

==Health issues and death==
Reeve suffered from asthma and allergy allergies since childhood. At age 16, he began to suffer from alopecia areata, a condition that causes patches of hair to fall out from an otherwise healthy head of hair. Generally, he was able to comb it over and often the problem disappeared for long periods. Regarding this condition of Reeves and his appearances in the Superman films, "[he] dyed his hair black to emulate the look of the Man of Steel for Superman (1978 film) Superman: The Movie and Superman II. However, rather than going that route in Superman III and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, [he] wore a wig"<ref>Thrash, Steven. "15 Shocking Things You Didnt Know About The Horrible Superman III." Screen Rant. Valnet, 19 Sept. 2017. Web. 20 Aug. 2018.</ref>  Later in life, the condition became more noticeable after he became paralyzed, and he would have his head shaved.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (2004), p 6</ref>

More than once he had a severe adverse drug reaction reaction to a drug. In Kessler, he tried a drug named Sygen which was theorized to help reduce damage to the spinal cord. The drug caused him to go into anaphylactic shock, and his heart stopped. He claimed to have had an out-of-body experience and remembered saying, "Im sorry, but I have to go now", during the event. In his autobiography, he wrote, "and then I left my body. I was up on the ceiling...I looked down and saw my body stretched out on the bed, not moving, while everybody—there were 15 or 20 people, the doctors, the EMTs, the nurses—was working on me. The noise and commotion grew quieter as though someone were gradually turning down the volume." After receiving a large dose of epinephrine, he woke up and stabilized later that night.<ref>Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 106–108</ref>
