Rolls was born in Berkeley Square, London, third son of the John Rolls, 1st Baron Llangattock 1st Baron Llangattock and Lady Llangattock. Despite his London birth, he retained a strong family connection with his ancestral home<ref>{{Cite web   url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/372038   title=The Hendre   publisher=Geograph Britain and Ireland   accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> of The Hendre, near Monmouth, Wales. After attending Mortimer Vicarage Preparatory school (UK) Preparatory School in Berkshire, he was educated at Eton College where his developing interest in engines earned him the nickname dirty Rolls.<ref name="The_Magic_Of_A_Name">{{cite book   last = Pugh   first = Peter   title = The Magic of a Name – The Rolls-Royce Story: The First 40 Years   publisher = Icon Books   year = 2001   isbn = 1-84046-151-9 }}</ref>

In 1894 he attended a private Cram school crammer in Cambridge which helped him gain entry to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied mechanical and applied science. In 1896, at the age of 18, he travelled to Paris to buy his first car, a Peugeot Phaeton body Phaeton, and joined the French Automobile Club Automobile Club of France. His Peugeot is believed to have been the first car based in Cambridge, and one of the first three cars owned in Wales. An early motoring enthusiast, he joined the Self-Propelled Traffic Association, which campaigned against the restrictions imposed on motor vehicles by the Locomotive Act, and became a founder member of the Royal Automobile Club Automobile Club of Great Britain, with which the Association merged in 1897.<ref>{{cite book   last = Vance   first = James   title = Ways of the World: A History of the Worlds Roads and of the Vehicles That Used Them   publisher = Rutgers University Press   year = 1992   isbn = 0-8135-2691-4 }}</ref>

Rolls was a keen cyclist and spent time at Cambridge bicycle racing. In 1896, he won a Blue (university sport) Half Blue and the following year became captain of the Cambridge University Bicycle Club.<ref name=TT39323>Aeroplane Accident, Mr Rolls Killed at Bournemouth.

Rolls graduated from Cambridge in 1898 and began working on the steam yacht Santa Maria followed by a position at the London and North Western Railway in Crewe.<ref name="The_Magic_Of_A_Name"/> However, his talents lay more in salesmanship and motoring pioneering than practical engineering; in January 1903, with the help of £6,600 provided by his father, he started one of Britains first car dealerships,<ref name="BBC" /> C.S.Rolls & Co. based in Fulham, to import and sell French Peugeot and Belgian Minerva (automobile) Minerva vehicles.

Rolls was introduced to Henry Royce by a friend at the Royal Automobile Club, Henry Edmunds, who was also a director of Royce Ltd. Edmunds showed him Royces car and arranged the historic meeting between Rolls and Royce at the Midland Hotel (Manchester) Midland Hotel, Manchester, on 4 May 1904. In spite of his preference for three or four cylinder cars, Rolls was impressed with the two-cylinder Royce 10 and in a subsequent agreement of 23 December 1904 agreed to take all the cars Royce could make. These would be of two, three, four and six cylinders and would be badged as Rolls-Royces.

The first Rolls-Royce car, the Rolls-Royce 10 hp, was unveiled at the Paris Motor Show Paris Salon in December 1904, although in the early advertising it was the name of Rolls that was emphasised over that of Royce. In 1906 Rolls and Royce formalised their partnership by creating Rolls-Royce Limited, with Rolls appointed Technical managing director on a salary of £750 per annum plus 4% of the profits in excess of £10,000. Rolls provided the financial backing and business acumen to complement Royces technical expertise. In 1907 Rolls-Royce Limited bought out C.S. Rolls & Co.

Rolls put much effort into publicising the quietness and smoothness of the Rolls-Royce, and at the end of 1906 travelled to the USA to promote the new cars. The company was winning awards for the quality and reliability of its cars by 1907. But by 1909 Rolls interest in the business was waning, and at the end of the year he resigned as Technical managing director and became a non-executive director.<ref name="The_Magic_Of_A_Name"/>
