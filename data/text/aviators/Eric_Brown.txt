==Early life==
Brown was born in Leith, near Edinburgh, Scotland.<ref name="Royal Navys most-decorated pilot dies aged 97"/> His father was a former balloon observer and pilot in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and Brown first flew when he was eight or ten when he was taken up in a Gloster Gauntlet by his father, the younger Brown sitting on his fathers knee.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmY-YUWGKWY title=Captain Eric Melrose "Winkle" Brown.

In 1936, Browns father took him to see the 1936 Summer Olympics 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Hermann Göring had recently announced the existence of the Luftwaffe, so Brown and his father met and were invited to join social gatherings by members of the newly disclosed organisation. It was here that Eric Brown first met Ernst Udet, a former World War I fighter ace, who was fascinated to make the acquaintance of a former RFC pilot, and Eric, his son.<ref name="Holland2015" />

Brown soon discovered in himself and Udet a shared love of flying and Udet offered to take Eric up with him.<ref name="Captain Eric Winkle Brown: Officer, Gentleman, Test Pilot Extraordinaire" /> Brown eagerly accepted the Germans offer and after his arrival at the appointed airfield at Halle, Saxony-Anhalt Halle, he was soon flying in a two-seat Bücker Bü 131 Bücker Jungmann. Brown recalled the incident nearly 80 years later on the BBC radio programme Desert Island Discs,<ref>{{citation url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02bkyyb publisher=BBC title=Captain Eric Winkle Brown, former test pilot: I was hanging on to my tummy date=14 November 2014}}</ref>{{quote You talk about aerobatics – we did every one I think and I was hanging on to my tummy.

But he said to me, youll make a fine fighter pilot – do me two favours: learn to speak German language German fluently and learn to fly.}}

In 1937, Brown left the Royal High School, Edinburgh Royal High School and entered the University of Edinburgh, studying Modern Languages modern languages with an emphasis on German. While there he joined the universitys air unit and received his first formal flying instruction.<ref name="Holland2015" /> In February 1938 he returned to Germany under the sponsorship of the Foreign Office, having been invited to attend the 1938 Automobile Exhibition by Udet, by then a Luftwaffe major general.<ref name="Holland2015" /> He there saw the demonstration of the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 helicopter flown by Hanna Reitsch before a small crowd inside the Deutschlandhalle. During this visit he met and got to know Reitsch, whom he had also briefly met in 1936.<ref name="Captain Eric Winkle Brown: Officer, Gentleman, Test Pilot Extraordinaire" />

In the meantime, Brown had been selected to take part as an exchange student at the Schule Schloss Salem, located on the banks of Lake Constance, and it was while there in Germany that Brown was woken up with a loud knocking on his door one morning in September 1939. Upon opening the door he was met by a woman with the announcement that "United Kingdom declaration of war upon Germany (1939) our countries are at war". Soon after, Brown was arrested by the Schutzstaffel SS. However, after three days incarceration, they merely escorted Brown in his MG N-type MG Magnette sports car to the Swiss border, saying they were allowing him to keep the car because they "had no spares for it".<ref name="Holland2015" /><ref name="afresearch.org">[https://www.afresearch.org/skins/rims/q_mod_be0e99f3-fc56-4ccb-8dfe-670c0822a153/q_act_downloadpaper/q_obj_8f344cd8-def6-4cf0-8f09-b1ae3d0bb216/display.aspx?rs=enginespage Profile], afresearch.org  {{webarchive  url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724225301/https://www.afresearch.org/skins/rims/q_mod_be0e99f3-fc56-4ccb-8dfe-670c0822a153/q_act_downloadpaper/q_obj_8f344cd8-def6-4cf0-8f09-b1ae3d0bb216/display.aspx?rs=enginespage  date=24 July 2011 }}</ref>

==Wartime service==

On returning to a United Kingdom then at war, Brown joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve as a Fleet Air Arm pilot, where he was posted to 802 Naval Air Squadron, initially serving on the first escort carrier, HMS Audacity (D10) HMS Audacity, converted and thus named in July 1941.<ref name= Carrier>{{Cite web url=http://www.royalnavyresearcharchive.org.uk/ESCORT/AUDACITY.htm title=A History of HMS AUDACITY publisher=Royal Navy Research Archive  accessdate=20 January 2009}}</ref> He flew one of the carriers Grumman F4F Wildcat Grumman Martlet.

The loss of life was such that 802 Squadron was disbanded until February 1942. On 10 March 1942, Brown was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom) Distinguished Service Cross for his service on Audacity, in particular "For bravery and skill in action against Enemy aircraft and in the protection of a Convoy against heavy and sustained Enemy attacks".<ref name="dsc">{{London Gazette issue=35481  supp=y  page=1106 date=6 March 1942}}</ref>

Following the loss of Audacity, Brown resumed operational flying, being Secondment seconded to Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) squadrons flying escort operations to United States Army Air Forces USAAF Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress B-17s over France. His job was to train them in deck-landing techniques, though the training took place on airfields.<ref group="Note">The training was in preparation for the allied invasions amphibious operations against Salerno landings Salerno.

This Brown did with almost no tuition, information having to be gleaned from whatever documents were available. On completion of these duties, his commander, being impressed with his performance, sent him back to the RAE with the recommendation that he be employed in the Aerodynamics Flight department at Farnborough. During the first month in the Flight, Brown flew 13 aircraft types, including a captured Focke-Wulf Fw 190.

Brown was posted to the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough Airfield Farnborough, where his experience in Flight deck deck landings was sought. While there he initially performed testing of the newly navalised Sea Hurricane#Sea Hurricanes Sea Hurricane and Supermarine Seafire Seafire. His aptitude for deck landings led to his posting for the testing of carriers landing arrangements before they were brought into service. The testing involved multiple combinations of landing point and type of aircraft, with the result being that by the close of 1943 he had performed around 1,500 deck landings on 22 different carriers. In six years at RAE, Brown recalled that he hardly ever took a single days leave.<ref name=greatest/>  During carrier compatibility trials, Brown crash-landed a Fairey Firefly Mk I, Z1844, on the deck of HMS Pretoria Castle HMS Pretoria Castle on 9 September 1943, when the tailhook arrestor hook indicator light falsely showed the hook was in the "down" position, compounded by the batsman failing to notice that the hook wasnt down.<ref>Memories of a WWII Hero: Captain Browns Story (film)</ref> The fighter hit the crash barrier, sheared off its undercarriage and shredded the propeller, but he was unhurt.<ref name="Harrison, 1998" >{{cite journal last=Harrison first=William A. title=Fairey Firefly Variants journal=Wings of Fame volume=12 publisher=AIRTime Publishing location=Westport, Connecticut year=1998 isbn=1-880588-23-4 page=113 ref=Harrison, 1998}}</ref>

While at Farnborough as chief naval test pilot, Brown was involved in the deck landing trials of the de Havilland Mosquito Sea Mosquito, the heaviest aircraft yet chosen to be flown from a British carrier. Brown landed one for the first time on HMS Indefatigable (R10) HMS Indefatigable on 25 March 1944. This was the first landing on a carrier by a twin-engined aircraft.<ref>David Hobbs: A Century of Carrier Aviation. Seaforth Publishing, Barnsley 2009, {{ISBN 978-1-84832-019-2}}. Page 186</ref><ref group="Note">The North American B-25 Mitchell had been flown off a carrier earlier during the Doolittle Raid attack on Tokyo led by Jimmy Doolittle James Doolittle; however the aircraft had been loaded aboard the carrier by crane.</ref> The fastest speed for deck landing was 86 kts, while the aircrafts stall speed was 110 kts.<ref name=greatest/> He also flew several stints with RAF Fighter Command Fighter Command in the air defence of Great Britain. During this time, in the summer of 1944, Browns home was destroyed by a V-1 flying bomb V-1 "Doodlebug" cruise missile, concussing his wife and causing serious injury to their cleaner.  At this time, the RAE was the leading authority on high-speed flight and Brown became involved in this sort of testing, flights being flown where the aircraft, usually a Supermarine Spitfire Spitfire, would be dived at speeds of the high Aerodynamics#Incompressible aerodynamics subsonic and near transonic region. Figures achieved by Brown and his colleagues during these tests reached Mach number Mach 0.86 for a standard Spitfire IX, to Mach 0.92 for a modified Spitfire PR Mk XI flown by his colleague, Squadron Leader Anthony F. Martindale.

===Assisting the USAAFs Eighth Air Force===

Together with Brown and Martindale, the RAE Aerodynamics Flight also included two other test pilots, Sqn Ldr James "Jimmy" Nelson and Sqn Ldr Douglas Weightman.<ref name="Wings on my Sleeve, p69" >#Brown, Wings on my Sleeve Wings on my Sleeve p.&nbsp;69</ref> During this same period the RAE was approached by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) General Jimmy Doolittle with a request for help, as the Eighth Air Force 8th Air Force had been having trouble when their Lockheed P-38 Lightning Lightning, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt Thunderbolt and North American P-51 Mustang Mustang aircraft, providing top cover for the bombers, dived down onto attacking German fighters, some of the diving U.S. fighters encountering speed regions where they became Sound barrier difficult to control.

As a result of Doolittles request, early in 1944 the P-38H Lightning, Packard Merlin-powered P-51B Mustang and P-47C Thunderbolt were dived for compressibility testing at the RAE by Brown and several other pilots. The results of the tests were that the tactical Mach numbers, i.e., the manoeuvring limits, were Mach 0.68 for the Lightning, Mach 0.71 for the Thunderbolt and Mach 0.78 for the Mustang. The corresponding figure for both the Fw 190 and Messerschmitt Bf 109 Bf 109 was Mach 0.75. The tests flown by Brown and his colleagues resulted in Doolittle being able to argue with his superiors for the Mustang to be chosen in preference to the P-38 and P-47 for all escort duties from then on.

===Browns first encounters with jet flight===

Brown had been made aware of the British progress in jet propulsion in May 1941 when he had heard of the Gloster E.28/39 after diverting in bad weather to RAF Cranwell during a flight and had subsequently met Frank Whittle when asked to suggest improvements to the jet engine to make it more suitable for naval use. This resulted in the Gloster Meteor being selected as the Royal Navys first jet fighter, although, as it turned out, few would be used by them. Brown was also selected as the pilot for the Miles M.52 supersonic research aircraft programme, and he flew modified aircraft incorporating components intended for the M.52; however, the post-war government later cancelled the project in 1945 with the M.52 almost complete.<ref name="afresearch.org"/>  On 2 May 1944, he was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire MBE "for outstanding enterprise and skill in piloting aircraft during hazardous aircraft trials."<ref name="London Gazette Issue 36495">{{London Gazette issue=36495 page=2009 date=28 April 1944}}</ref>

===Browns first encounter with helicopters===

In February 1945, Brown learned that the Aerodynamics Flight had been allocated three Sikorsky R-4 Sikorsky R-4B Hoverfly/Gadfly helicopters. He had never seen one of these tail-rotor machines, so a trip to Farnborough was arranged and Brown had a short flight as a passenger in one. A few days later, Brown and Martindale were sent to Liverpool John Lennon Airport RAF Speke to collect two new R-4Bs.

On arrival, they found the American mechanics assembling the machines, and when Brown asked the Master Sergeant in charge about himself and Martindale being Flight training taught to fly them, he was handed a "large orange-coloured booklet" with the retort; "Whaddya mean, bud? – Heres your instructor". Brown and Martindale examined the booklet and after several practice attempts at hovering and controlling the craft, followed by a stiff drink, they set off for Farnborough. Brown and Martindale managed the trip safely, if raggedly, in formation, although sometimes as much as a couple of miles apart.<ref name="Wings on my Sleeve, p91-92" >#Brown, Wings on my Sleeve Wings on my Sleeve p.&nbsp;91–92</ref>

On 4 April, Brown added another "first" to his logbook when engaged in trials in relation to the Rubber deck flexible deck concept with HMS Pretoria Castle, in which he was supposed to make a number of landing approaches to the escort carrier in a Bell P-39 Airacobra Bell Airacobra, which had coincidentally been modified with a tail hook. During one of these passes, Brown declared an emergency and was given permission to make a deck landing; a ruse which had previously been agreed with the carriers captain, Caspar John. Although the landing was achieved without difficulty, the long take off run required for the Airacobra meant that even with the ship steaming at full speed, there was little margin of error. This was the first carrier landing and take off for any aircraft with a tricycle undercarriage.<ref>#Brown, Wings on my Sleeve Wings on my Sleeve pp. 95–96</ref>

===The RAEs "Enemy Flight"===

With the end of the European war in sight, the RAE prepared itself to acquire German aeronautical technology and aircraft before it was either accidentally destroyed or taken by the Soviets, and, because of his skills in the language, Brown was made the commanding officer of "Operation Enemy Flight". He flew to northern Germany; among the targets for the RAE was the Arado Ar 234, a new jet bomber in which the Allies, particularly the Americans, were very much interested. A number of the jets were based at an airfield in Denmark, the German forces having retreated there. He expected to arrive at a liberated aerodrome, just after it had been taken by the British Army; however, German resistance to the Allied advance meant that the ground forces had been delayed and the airfield was still an operational Luftwaffe base. Luckily for Brown, the commanding officer of the Luftwaffe airfield at Air Base Karup Grove offered his surrender and Brown took charge of the airfield and its staff of 2,000 men until Allied forces arrived the next day.

Subsequently, Brown and Martindale, along with several other members of the Aerodynamics Flight and assisted by a co-operative German pilot, later Ferry flying ferried twelve Ar 234s across the North Sea and on to Farnborough. The venture was not without risk, as before their capture, the Germans had destroyed all the engine log books for the aircraft, leaving Brown and his colleagues no idea of the expected engine hours remaining to the machines. Because of the scarcity of the special high-temperature alloys for use in their construction, the Junkers Jumo 004 engines had a life of only 25 hours – it was thus not known whether the engines were brand new or just about to expire.<ref name="Wings on my Sleeve, p116">#Brown, Wings on my Sleeve Wings on my Sleeve, p. 116</ref>

During this period, Brown was asked by Brigadier Hugh Llewellyn Glyn Hughes Glyn Hughes, the Medical Officer of the British Second Army (United Kingdom) 2nd Army occupying the newly liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, to help interrogate the former camp commandant and his assistant.<ref name="Wings on my Sleeve, p94" >#Brown, Wings on my Sleeve Wings on my Sleeve p.&nbsp;94</ref> Agreeing to do so, he soon interviewed Josef Kramer and Irma Grese, and remarked upon the experience by saying that; "Two more loathsome creatures it is hard to imagine" and further describing the latter as "...&nbsp;the worst human being I have ever met." Kramer and Grese were later Belsen Trial tried and hanged for war crimes.<ref name="afresearch.org"/><ref name="google.co.uk">{{cite web url=http://www.gapan.org/ruth-documents/guild-news/GUILD%20NEWS%20June%2009%20pt1.pdf archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402184238/http://www.gapan.org/ruth-documents/guild-news/GUILD%20NEWS%20June%2009%20pt1.pdf dead-url=yes archive-date=2012-04-02 format=PDF title=Guild News date=June 2009 publisher=Gapan.org accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref>

==Postwar==
File:He 177 A-5.jpg thumb right The captured Heinkel He 177 He 177 A-5 in British markings flown by Brown at Farnborough in September 1944
After World War II‚ Brown commanded the No. 1426 Flight RAF Enemy Aircraft Flight, an elite group of pilots who test-flew captured German and Italian aircraft. That experience rendered Brown one of the few men to have been qualified to compare both Allied and Axis aeroplanes as they flew during the war. He flight-tested 53 German aircraft, including the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet rocket fighter.<ref name="Royal Navys most-decorated pilot dies aged 97"/> That Komet is now on display at the National Museum of Flight in Scotland.

His flight test of this rocket plane, the only one by an Allied pilot using the rocket motor, was accomplished unofficially: it was deemed to be more or less suicidal due to the Hypergolic notoriously dangerous C-Stoff fuel and T-Stoff oxidizer combination.

Commenting to a newspaper in September 2015 he recalled, <blockquote>To me it was the most exciting thing on the horizon, a totally new experience. I remember watching the ground crew very carefully before take-off, wondering if they thought they were waving goodbye to me forever or whether they thought this thing was going to return. The noise it made was absolutely thunderous and it was like being in charge of a runaway train; everything changed so rapidly and I really had to have my wits about me.<ref name="Royal Navys most-decorated pilot dies aged 97"/></blockquote> Brown flight tested all three of the German jet designs to see front-line action in the war: the Messerschmitt Me 262 and the Arado Ar 234, each type powered by Junkers Jumo 004 engines, and the BMW 003-powered Heinkel He 162 turbojet combat aircraft.<ref name="Dorr2013">{{cite book author=Robert F.

In a throwback to his days testing aircraft in high speed dives, while at the RAE Brown performed similar testing of the Avro Tudor airliner. The requirement was to determine the safe limiting speed for the aircraft and to gather data on high-speed handling of large civil aircraft in preparation for a projected four-jet version of the Tudor. Flying from 32,000&nbsp;ft, in a succession of dives to speeds initially to Mach 0.6, he succeeded in diving the Tudor up to Mach 0.7, an unusual figure for such a large piston-engined aeroplane, this speed figure being dictated by the pilots discretion, as pulling the aircraft out of the dive had required the combined efforts of both Brown and his second pilot. However, as an airliner, the Tudor was not a success. The planned jet version of the Tudor would later become the Avro Ashton.<ref name="Wings on my Sleeve, p174">#Brown, Wings on my Sleeve Wings on my Sleeve p.&nbsp;174</ref>
File:DeHavilland Swallow VW120 NAN7-49.jpg thumb The high-speed de Havilland DH 108 DH 108 VW120 that Brown flew. This aircraft later crashed, killing Browns successor at the RAE, Sqn Ldr Stuart Muller-Rowland.

In 1946 he test flew a modified (strengthened and control-boosted) de Havilland DH.108, after a crash in a similar aircraft while diving at speeds approaching the sound barrier had killed Geoffrey de Havilland, Jr. Brown initially started his tests from a height of 35,000&nbsp;ft, rising to 45,000&nbsp;ft and during a dive from the latter he achieved a Mach number of 0.985. It was only when attempting the tests from the same height as de Havilland, 4,000&nbsp;ft,<!-- this cant be right surely? intended to be "40,000" or "above 40,000"? --> that he discovered that in a Mach 0.88 dive from that altitude the aircraft suffered from a high-g-force g Flight dynamics pitch oscillation at several hertz (Hz). "The ride was smooth, then suddenly it all went to pieces&nbsp;... as the plane porpoised wildly my chin hit my chest, jerked hard back, slammed forward again, repeated it over and over, flogged by the awful whipping of the plane&nbsp;...". Remembering the drill he had often practised, Brown managed to pull back gently on both stick and throttle and the motion; "...&nbsp;ceased as quickly as it had started".<ref name="Wings on my Sleeve, p184" >#Brown, Wings on my Sleeve Wings on my Sleeve p.&nbsp;184</ref> He believed that he survived the test flight partly because he was a shorter man, de Havilland having suffered a Cervical fracture broken neck possibly due to the violent oscillation.<ref name="Brown, Wings on my Sleeve, p184" >#Brown, Wings on my Sleeve Wings on my Sleeve, p.&nbsp;184</ref>

Test instrumentation on Browns flight recorded during the oscillations accelerations of +4 and −3gs at 3&nbsp;Hz. Brown described the DH 108 as; "A killer. Nasty Stall (flight) stall. Vicious undamped longitudinal oscillation at speed in bumps".<ref name="Brown, Wings on my Sleeve, p147" >#Brown, Wings on my Sleeve Wings on my Sleeve, p. 147</ref> All three DH.108 aircraft were lost in fatal accidents.

In 1948 Brown was awarded the Boyd Trophy for his work in trials for the rubber deck landing system.<ref>Ray Sturtivant Squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm. Air Britain (Historians) Ltd (1984) {{ISBN 0-85130-120-7}}.

On 12 August 1949, he was testing the third of three Saunders-Roe SR.A/1 jet-powered flying-boat fighter prototypes, TG271, when he struck submerged debris, which resulted in the aircraft sinking in the Solent off Cowes, Isle of Wight.<ref name="Hooks, Mike p. 90">Hooks, Mike, "The Jet Boat", Aeroplane, London, UK, Number 411, Volume 35, Number 7, p. 90.</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://daveg4otu.tripod.com/iowweb/iowc.html  title=Isle Of Wight Crashes  publisher=Daveg4otu.tripod.com  date=25 November 2008  accessdate=8 May 2010  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905024649/http://daveg4otu.tripod.com/iowweb/iowc.html  archivedate=5 September 2010  df=dmy-all }}</ref> Meanwhile, he was pulled unconscious from the cockpit of the wrecked aircraft by his Saunders-Roe test pilot Geoffrey Tyson, having been knocked out in the crash. He was promoted lieutenant-commander on 1 April 1951,<ref>{{London Gazette issue=39218 page=2460 date=1 May 1951}}</ref> commander on 31 December 1953<ref>{{London Gazette issue=40075 page=378 date=15 January 1954}}</ref> and Captain (naval) captain on 31 December 1960.<ref>{{London Gazette issue=42247 page=200 date=10 January 1961}}</ref>

Brown was responsible for at least two important firsts in aircraft carrier carrier aviation – the first carrier landing using an aircraft equipped with a Tricycle gear tricycle undercarriage (Bell Aircraft Corporation Bell P-39 Airacobra Mk 1 AH574) on the trials carrier HMS Pretoria Castle (F61) HMS Pretoria Castle on 4 April 1945 and the worlds first carrier landing of a jet aircraft, landing the de Havilland Vampire de Havilland Sea Vampire United Kingdom military aircraft serials LZ551/G on the Royal Navy carrier HMS Ocean (R68) HMS Ocean on 3 December 1945.

In the 1950s during the Korean War, Brown was seconded as an exchange officer for two years to Naval Air Station Patuxent River Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, where he flew a number of American aircraft, including 36 types of helicopter. In January 1952, it was while at Patuxent River that Brown demonstrated the steam catapult to the Americans, flying a Grumman F9F Panther Grumman Panther off the carrier HMS Perseus (R51) HMS Perseus while the ship was still tied up to the dock at the Philadelphia Naval Yard. It had been planned for Brown to make the first catapult launch with the ship under way and steaming into any wind; however, the wind on the day was so slight that British officials decided that, as the new steam catapult was capable of launching an aircraft without any wind, they would risk their pilot (Brown) if the Americans would risk their aircraft. The launch was a success and US carriers would later feature the steam catapult.

It was around the same time that another British invention was being offered to the US, the Flight deck#Angled flight deck angled flight deck, and Brown once again was called upon to promote the concept. Whether due to Brown or not, the first US aircraft carrier modified with the new flight deck, the USS Antietam (CV-36) USS Antietam, was ready less than nine months later.<ref name="afresearch.org"/>

In 1954 Brown, by then a Commander(rank), became Commander (Air) of the RAF Brawdy RNAS Brawdy, where he remained until returning to Germany in late 1957, becoming Chief of British Naval Mission to Germany, his brief being to re-establish German naval aviation after its pre-war integration with and subornation to, the Luftwaffe. During this period Brown worked closely with Admiral Gerhard Wagner (Admiral) Gerhard Wagner of the German Naval Staff. Training was conducted initially in the UK on Hawker Sea Hawks and Fairey Gannets, and during this time Brown was allocated a personal Percival Pembroke aircraft by the Marineflieger, which, to his surprise, the German maintenance personnel took great pride in. It was, in fact, the first exclusively naval aircraft the German Navy had owned since the 1930s.<ref name="Wings on my Sleeve, p230" >#Brown, Wings on my Sleeve Wings on my Sleeve p.&nbsp;230</ref> Brown led the re-emergence of naval aviation in Germany to the point that in 1960 Marineflieger squadrons were integrated into NATO.

Later Brown enjoyed a brief three-month period as a test pilot for the Focke-Wulf company, helping them out until they could find a replacement after the companys previous test pilot had been detained due to having relatives in East Germany.<ref name="afresearch.org"/><ref name="Wings on my Sleeve, p233" >#Brown, Wings on my Sleeve Wings on my Sleeve p.&nbsp;233</ref>

In the 1960s, due to his considerable experience of carrier aviation, Brown, while working at the Admiralty as deputy director of naval air warfare, was consulted on the flight deck arrangement of the planned new UK class of aircraft carrier, the CVA-01, although the ship was subsequently cancelled while still on the stocks.

In September 1967 came his last appointment in the Royal Navy when, as a captain (Royal Navy) captain, he took command of HMS Fulmar, then the Naval air station Royal Naval Air Station (now RAF), Lossiemouth, until March 1970. He was appointed a Naval Aide de Camp naval aide de camp to Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Queen Elizabeth II on 7 July 1969<ref>{{London Gazette issue=44895  supp=y  page=7283 date=11 July 1969}}</ref> and appointed Order of the British Empire Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1970 New Year Honours.<ref name="London Gazette Issue 44999">{{London Gazette issue=44999  supp=y  page=5 date=30 December 1969}}</ref>  He relinquished his appointment as naval ADC on 27 January 1970 and retired from the Royal Navy later in 1970<!-- This probably coincides with his retirement, but this is not explicitly stated in the source -->.<ref>{{London Gazette issue=45026  supp=y  page=1049 date=23 January 1970}}</ref>

==Records==
{{main List of aircraft flown by Eric "Winkle" Brown}}
Brown flew aircraft from Britain, the United States, Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy and Japan and is listed in the Guinness World Records Guinness Book of World Records as holding the record for flying the greatest number of different aircraft. The official record is 487, but includes only basic types. For example, Brown flew 14 versions of the Supermarine Spitfire Spitfire and Supermarine Seafire Seafire and although these versions are very different they appear only once in the list. This list includes only aircraft flown by Brown as "Captain in Command".

Because of the special circumstances involved, Brown didnt think that this record would ever be topped.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JL5M21NLUg  title=Yuri Gagarins meeting with test Pilot Eric Brown 13th July 1961  publisher=YouTube  date=  accessdate=1 June 2014}}</ref>

He also held the world record for the most carrier landings, 2,407, partly compiled in testing the arrestor wires on more than 20 aircraft carriers during World War II.

==Credits==
In his book Wings On My Sleeve (page 157 et seq), Brown records his admiration of a number of erstwhile colleagues who deserve recognition:-

{{quote I was fortunate to have such fine C.O.s as Alan Hards, Sydney Richard Ubee Dick Ubee, Silyn Roberts and Alan Wheeler. ... It was always a thrill to me to meet and talk flying business with men like Geoffrey Tyson, Harald Penrose, Jeffrey Quill, Mutt Summers, Bill Pegg and George Errington. All these had been heroes in my private hall of fame long before I knew them personally. ... Geoffrey de Havilland, Bill Humble and Alex Henshaw ... They were men of great dash ... Mike Lithgow, Peter Twiss, John Cunningham (RAF officer) John Cunningham of Comet fame, John Derry, Neville Duke and Roland Beamont.}}

Brown goes on to mention the pilot of the first jet flight in Britain, Jerry Sayer, then the aircraft designers R. J. Mitchell (designer of the Spitfire), Sir Sydney Camm, Ronald Eric Bishop R. E. Bishop, Roy Chadwick and Joseph Smith (aircraft designer) Joe Smith, followed by the names of what he describes as "boffins and boffinettes", which include the brilliant aerodynamicists Morien Morgan, Handel Davies, Dai Morris and P. A. Hufton, and the "boffinettes" like Gwen Alston, Anne Burns (structural engineer), Dorothy Pearse (aircraft engineer) and Pauline Gower (head of the womens section of the Air Transport Auxiliary ATA).

Browns last credits mention Lewis Boddington, Dr. Thomlinson, John Noble and Charles Crowfoot, whom he records (with "others") as being responsible for "giving the Royal Navy a technical lead in aircraft carrier equipment which it still holds to this day [1978]." He ends this section: "These men and women were civil servants, but they worked hours, took responsibility, and produced results far beyond what their country paid them for. To me they represent the true measure of Britains greatness."<ref name="Brown2008_204-5">{{cite book author=Eric Brown title=Wings On My Sleeve: The WorldS Greatest Test Pilot Tells His Story url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hgA5AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT205 date=18 September 2008 publisher=Orion Publishing Group isbn=978-0-297-85690-0 pages=204–5}}</ref>

==Books==
Brown wrote several books about his experiences, including ones describing the flight characteristics of the various aircraft he flew and an autobiography, Wings on My Sleeve, first published in 1961 and considerably up-dated in later editions. He was also the author of dozens of articles in aviation magazines and journals.<ref name="theaviationindex.com">{{cite web url=http://www.theaviationindex.com/authors/eric-brown archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609055958/http://www.theaviationindex.com/authors/eric-brown dead-url=yes archive-date=9 June 2011 title=Eric Brown references, articles and publications publisher=Theaviationindex.com accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref>

His best-known series of articles is "Viewed from the Cockpit", which was published (and occasionally re-published) in the journal Air International.<ref name="theaviationindex.com"/> Flight review highlights in this series have included the following types:

*Dornier Do 217
*Fairey Swordfish
*Fairey Fulmar
*Fairey Spearfish, a prototype torpedo bomber (1947) which Brown did not enjoy
*Fairey Barracuda, which Brown found lacklustre and somewhat disappointing
*Focke-Wulf Fw 190 A and D Series.<ref name="Brown, Wings of the Luftwaffe, p78-91" >#Brown, Wings of the Luftwaffe Wings of the Luftwaffe, pp.&nbsp;78–91</ref>

*Hawker Sea Fury
*Hawker Hurricane Hawker Sea-Hurricane
*Heinkel He 111
*Junkers Ju 87D Stuka
*Supermarine Seafire, various marks.
*Messerschmitt Bf 109 E (Emil) and G (Gustav) – Brown flew the G-12 training sub-type from the rear cockpit and nearly crashed because of poor visibility from that position.
*Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet. Brown was one of few pilots to successfully fly one of these, having signed a disclaimer for the German ground crew.<ref name="Brown, Wings of the Luftwaffe, p167-176" >Wings of the Luftwaffe, pp.&nbsp;167–176</ref>

As regards his preferences Brown states:
<blockquote>My favourite in the piston engine (era) is the de Havilland Hornet. For the simple reason it was over-powered. This is an unusual feature in an aircraft, you could do anything on one engine, almost, that you could do on two. It was a hot rod de Havilland Mosquito Mosquito really, I always described it as like flying a Ferrari in the sky.

On the jet side I was a great admirer of the North American F-86 Sabre F-86 Sabre, but in particular, the Model E (F-86E) which had the Stabilator flying tail, and this gave me what I call the perfect harmony of control. If a pilot has this perfect harmony of control you feel youre part of the aeroplane and youre bonded with it really. Youve got into it and the aeroplane welcomes you and says thank God youve come, youre part of me anyway and to fly like that is a sheer delight.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQzVZde_Ms4 title=Eric "Winkle" Brown publisher=YouTube accessdate=1 June 2014}}</ref>
</blockquote>

==Later life==
Brown served as president of the Royal Aeronautical Society from 1982-83.<ref name="Flight, Brown, RAeS"/> His last flight as a pilot was in 1994, but in 2015 he was still lecturing and regularly attending the UK Space Conference British Rocketry Oral History Programme (BROHP), where the annual presentation of the Sir Arthur Clarke Awards takes place. In 2007 he was the recipient of their Lifetime Achievement Award.<ref name="British Interplanetary Society">{{cite web title=The British Interplanetary Society: Sir Arthur Clarke Awards 2005-2014 url= http://www.bis-space.com/2013/04/05/9719/sir-arthur-clarke-awards-2005-2014 date=5 April 2013 website=British Interplanetary Society accessdate=23 February 2016}}</ref>

Brown lived, in semi-retirement, at Copthorne, West Sussex. He had married Evelyn (Lynn) Macrory in 1942. She died in 1998. He was interviewed many times, most recently by BBC Radio 4 at his home in April 2013.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rw940 title=BBC Radio 4 – iPM publisher=Bbc.co.uk date=20 April 2013 accessdate=1 June 2014}}</ref>

In June 2014 he was the subject of the hour-long BBC Two documentary Britains Greatest Pilot: The Extraordinary Story of Captain Winkle Brown.<ref name=greatest>{{cite web url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b045pbq2 title=Britains Greatest Pilot: The Extraordinary Story of Captain Winkle Brown publisher=Bbc.co.uk accessdate=1 June 2014}}</ref> Assessing those achievements, Mark Bowman, chief test pilot at BAE Systems, said, "They didnt have the advantage of high-tech simulators. He just had to look at the aircraft and think what he was going to do with it", adding that he would have been flying the aircraft with "the benefit of a slide rule, not a bank of computers as we have now."<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30039300 title=Eric Winkle Brown: The man who seemed not to notice danger publisher=Bbc.co.uk date=14 November 2014 accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref>

In November 2014 he was the guest for the 3,000th edition of BBC Radio 4s Desert Island Discs. During the programme, the 95-year-old said that he still enjoyed driving and had just bought himself a new sports car. His musical choices included "At Last" by the Glenn Miller Glenn Miller Orchestra and "Amazing Grace" by the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. His favourite was "Stardust (song) Stardust" by Artie Shaw Artie Shaw and His Orchestra.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29936069 title=BBC News – Desert Island Discs to feature war veteran on 3,000th show work=BBC News accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref>

On 24 February 2015 Brown delivered the University of Edinburgh Mountbatten Lecture, entitled "Britains Defence in the Near Future".<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2015/mountbatten-010415 title=Mountbatten Lecture goes live publisher=Ed.ac.uk date=13 April 2015 accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref> Speaking at the Playfair Library, he warned: "They [the Russians] are playing a very dangerous game of chess. ... They are playing it to the hilt. It may develop into that. It is certainly showing the same signs as what caused the Cold War."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/legendary-test-pilot-fears-new-cold-war-1-3700891#ixzz40pEzwIr5 title=Legendary test pilot fears new cold war publisher=Edinburghnews.scotsman.com date=25 February 2015 accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref>

In May 2015, Brown was awarded the Founders Medal by the Air League. This was presented to him by the patron, the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Duke of Edinburgh at the annual reception held at St Jamess Palace "for his amazing flying achievements and involvement with aviation during a remarkable lifetime."<ref>[http://www.airleague.co.uk/the-air-league-annual-reception-2015-2 Eric Brown awarded Founders Medal], airleague.co.uk; accessed 24 February 2016.</ref> Brown died aged 97 on 21 February 2016 at East Surrey Hospital in Redhill, Surrey after a short illness.<ref>[http://www.crawleynews.co.uk/Greatest-pilot-war-hero-Captain-Eric-Winkle-Brown/story-28779501-detail/story.html "Greatest pilot" war hero Captain Eric Winkle Brown dies aged 97], crawleynews.co.uk; accessed 24 February 2016.</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/world-s-greatest-aviator-eric-winkle-brown-dies-at-97-1-4035347 title=Worlds greatest aviator Eric Winkle Brown dies at 97 publisher=Edinburgh News accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref>

==Nickname==
Brown received the affectionate nickname "Winkle" from his Royal Navy colleagues. Short for Common periwinkle "Periwinkle", a small mollusc, the name was given to Brown because of his short stature of {{height ft=5 in=7}}.<ref name="google.co.uk"/><ref name="Royal Navys most-decorated pilot dies aged 97"/> Brown partly attributed his survival of dangerous incidents to his ability to "curl himself up in the cockpit".<ref name=greatest/>
