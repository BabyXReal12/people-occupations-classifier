===Powder Puff Derby===
In 1929, Kunz participated in the first Womens Air Derby, later dubbed the "Powder Puff Derby" by humorist Will Rogers. At the time, there were only 70 licensed female pilots in the entire United States, and only 40 qualified to take part in this contest. The transcontinental course began in Santa Monica, California, and ended in Cleveland, Ohio. 

Race rules stipulated that the aircraft must have horsepower "appropriate for a woman." Kunz was told her own 300-horsepower Beech Travel Air was too fast for a woman to handle and would not be allowed. Forced to  borrow a less-powerful airplane in order to take part in the race, she finished eighth.<ref name="Jessen">Jessen, Gene Nora.
