Stewart attended Mercersburg Academy prep school, graduating in 1928. He was active in a variety of activities. He played on the football and track teams (competing as a high jumper under coach Jimmy Curran), was art editor of the KARUX yearbook, and a member of the choir club, glee club, and John Marshall Literary Society. During his first summer break, Stewart returned to his hometown to work as a brick loader for a local construction company and on highway and road construction jobs where he painted lines on the roads.

A shy child, Stewart spent much of his after-school time in the basement working on model airplanes, mechanical drawing, and chemistry—all with a dream of going into aviation. It was a dream greatly enhanced by the legendary 1927 flight of Charles Lindbergh, whose progress 19-year-old Stewart, then stricken with scarlet fever, was avidly following from home, foreshadowing his starring movie role as Lindbergh 30 years later.<ref name=Berg>{{cite book last=Berg first=A.

However, he abandoned visions of being a pilot when his father insisted that instead of the United States Naval Academy he attend Princeton University. Stewart enrolled at Princeton in 1928 as a member of the class of 1932.

Retrieved January 11, 2011.</ref> His acting and accordion talents at Princeton led him to be invited to the University Players, an intercollegiate summer stock company in West Falmouth, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod. The company had been organized in 1928 and would run until 1932, with Joshua Logan, Bretaigne Windust and Charles Leatherbee as directors. Stewart performed in bit parts in the Players productions in Cape Cod during the summer of 1932, after he graduated.

The troupe had previously included Henry Fonda and Margaret Sullavan. Stewart and Fonda became close friends over the summer of 1932 when they shared an apartment with Joshua Logan and Myron McCormick.<ref>Fonda and Teichmann 1981, p. 74.</ref> When Stewart came to New York at the end of the summer stock season, which had included the Broadway tryout of Goodbye Again, he shared an apartment with Fonda, who had by then finalized his divorce from Sullavan. Along with fellow University Players Alfred Dalrymple and Myron McCormick, Stewart debuted on Broadway in the brief run of Carry Nation (play) Carry Nation and a few weeks later – again with McCormick and Dalrymple – as a chauffeur in the comedy Goodbye Again, in which he had two lines. The New Yorker commented, "Mr. James Stewarts chauffeur... comes on for three minutes and walks off to a round of spontaneous applause."<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 57.</ref>

The play was a moderate success, but times were hard. Many Broadway theaters had been converted to movie houses and the Great Depression Depression was reaching bottom. "From 1932 through 1934", Stewart later recalled, "Id only worked three months. Every play I got into folded."<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 58.</ref> By 1934, he was given more substantial stage roles, including the modest hit Page Miss Glory and his first dramatic stage role in Sidney Howards Yellow Jack (play) Yellow Jack, which convinced him to continue his acting career. However, Stewart and Fonda, still roommates, were both struggling. In the fall of 1934, Fondas success in The Farmer Takes a Wife took him to Cinema of the United States Hollywood. Finally, Stewart attracted the interest of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer MGM scout Bill Grady who saw Stewart on the opening night of Divided by Three, a glittering première with many luminaries in attendance, including Irving Berlin, Moss Hart and Fonda, who had returned to New York for the show. With Fondas encouragement, Stewart agreed to take a screen test, after which he signed a contract with MGM in April 1935, as a contract player for up to seven years at $350 a week.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 65.</ref>

Upon Stewarts arrival by train in Los Angeles, Fonda greeted him at the station and took him to Fondas studio-supplied lodging, next door to Greta Garbo. Stewarts first job at the studio was as a participant in screen tests with newly arrived starlets. At first, he had trouble being cast in Hollywood films owing to his gangling looks and shy, humble screen presence. Aside from an unbilled appearance in a Shemp Howard comedy short subject short called Art Trouble in 1934, his first film was the poorly received Spencer Tracy vehicle The Murder Man (1935). Rose Marie (1936 film) Rose Marie (1936), an adaptation of a popular operetta, was more successful. After having mixed success in films, he received his first intensely dramatic role in 1936s After the Thin Man, and played Jean Harlows characters frustrated boyfriend in the Clark Gable vehicle Wife vs. Secretary earlier that same year.

On the romantic front, he dated newly divorced Ginger Rogers.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 74.</ref> The romance soon cooled, however, and by chance Stewart encountered Margaret Sullavan again. Stewart found his footing in Hollywood thanks largely to Sullavan, who campaigned for Stewart to be her leading man in the 1936 romantic comedy Next Time We Love. She rehearsed extensively with him, having a noticeable effect on his confidence. She encouraged Stewart to feel comfortable with his unique mannerisms and boyish charm and use them naturally as his own style. Stewart was enjoying Hollywood life and had no regrets about giving up the stage, as he worked six days a week in the MGM factory.<ref>Eliot 2006, pp. 84, 87.</ref> In 1936, he acquired big-time agent Leland Hayward, who would eventually marry Sullavan. Hayward started to chart Stewarts career, deciding that the best path for him was through loan-outs to other studios.

File:James Stewart in You Cant Take It with You.jpg thumb left Frank Capras comedy You Cant Take It With You (film) You Cant Take It With You (1938) was one of the films that brought Stewart widespread attention
In 1938 Stewart had a brief, tumultuous romance with Hollywood queen Norma Shearer, whose husband, Irving Thalberg, head of production at MGM, had died two years earlier. Stewart began a successful partnership with director Frank Capra in 1938, when he was loaned out to Columbia Pictures to star in You Cant Take It With You (film) You Cant Take It With You. Capra had been impressed by Stewarts minor role in Navy Blue and Gold (film) Navy Blue and Gold (1937). The director had recently completed several well received films, including It Happened One Night (1934), and was looking for the right actor to suit his needs—other recent actors in Capras films such as Clark Gable, Ronald Colman, and Gary Cooper did not quite fit. Not only was Stewart just what he was looking for, but Capra also found Stewart understood that archetype intuitively and required very little directing. Later Capra commented, "I think hes probably the best actor whos ever hit the screen."<ref name="Eliot p. 105">Eliot 2006, p. 105.</ref>

You Cant Take It With You (film) You Cant Take It With You, starring Capras "favorite actress", comedian Jean Arthur, won the 1938 Academy Award for Best Picture Best Picture Academy Awards Academy Award. The following year saw Stewart work with Capra and Arthur again in the political comedy-drama Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Stewart replaced intended star Gary Cooper in the film, playing an idealist thrown into the political arena. Upon its October 1939 release, the film garnered critical praise and became a box-office success. Stewart received the first of five Academy Award nominations for Academy Award for Best Actor Best Actor. Stewarts father was still trying to talk him into leaving Hollywood and its sinful ways and to return to his home town to lead a decent life.

Destry Rides Again, also released in 1939, became Stewarts first western movie western film, a genre with which he would become identified later in his career. In this western parody, he is a pacifist lawman and Marlene Dietrich is the dancing saloon girl who comes to love him, but does not get him.

In 1940 Stewart and Sullavan reunited for two films. The first, the Ernst Lubitsch romantic comedy, The Shop Around the Corner, starred them as co-workers unknowingly involved in a pen-pal romance but who cannot stand each other in real life. It was Stewarts fifth film of the year and one of the rare ones shot in sequence; it was completed in only 27 days.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 144.</ref> The Mortal Storm, directed by Frank Borzage, was one of the first blatantly anti-Nazism Nazi films to be produced in Hollywood and featured Sullavan and Stewart as friends and then lovers caught in turmoil upon Adolf Hitler Hitlers rise to power, literally hunted down by their own friends.

Stewart also starred with Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn in George Cukors classic The Philadelphia Story (film) The Philadelphia Story (1940). His performance as an intrusive, fast-talking reporter earned him his only Academy Award in a competitive category (Best Actor, 1941); he beat out his good friend Henry Fonda (The Grapes of Wrath (film) The Grapes of Wrath).

Stewart enlisted as a private<ref name="The Jimmy Stewart Museum" /><ref name="jcs-group" /> but applied for an Air Corps commission and Auxiliary Pilot Badge#Service Pilot Service Pilot rating as both a college graduate and a licensed commercial pilot. Soon to be 33, he was almost six years beyond the maximum age restriction for Aviation Cadet training, the normal path of commissioning for pilots, navigators and bombardiers. The now-obsolete auxiliary pilot ratings (Glider Pilot, Liaison Pilot and Service Pilot) differed from the Aviation Cadet Program in that a higher maximum age limit and corrected vision were allowed upon initial entry. Stewart received his commission as a second lieutenant on January 1, 1942,<ref>Associated Press, "James Stewart Now Is Second Lieutenant", The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, Washington, Friday 2 January 1942, Volume 59, Number 233, page 2.</ref>   shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, while a corporal at Moffett Field, California. He received his Service Pilot rating at that time, under the Auxiliary Pilot Badge Service Pilot program established in March 1942 for experienced former civilian pilots. Although Service Pilots were normally restricted to noncombat flying, they were permitted to fly overseas on cargo and utility transports, typically with Air Transport, Ferry or Troop Carrier Commands. Under the regulations of the period, a Service Pilot could obtain an unrestricted Pilot rating after one year of USAAF service on flying status, provided he met certain flight experience requirements and passed an evaluation board, and some did in fact go on to combat flying assignments.<ref>U.S. Army Air Forces (1 October 1943).

File:You Gotta Stay Happy poster.jpg right thumb 135px
Magic Town (1947), a comedy film directed by William A. Wellman, starring James Stewart and Jane Wyman, was one of the first films about the then-new science of public opinion polling. It was poorly received. He completed Rope (film) Rope (1948) directed by Alfred Hitchcock and Call Northside 777 (1948), and weathered two box-office disappointments with On Our Merry Way (1948), a comedic musical ensemble in which Stewart and Henry Fonda were paired as two jazz musicians, and You Gotta Stay Happy (1949), for which the posters depicted Stewart being kissed on one cheek by Joan Fontaine and on the other by a chimpanzee. In the documentary film James Stewart: A Wonderful Life (1987), hosted by Johnny Carson, Stewart said that he went back to Western (genre) Westerns in 1950 in part because of the string of flops.

He returned to the stage to star in Mary Coyle Chases Harvey (play) Harvey, which had opened to nearly universal praise in November 1944,<ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 214">Eliot 2006, p. 214.</ref> as Elwood P.

While trying to have Dowd committed to a sanatorium, his sister is committed herself while the play follows Dowd on an ordinary day in his not-so-ordinary life. Stewart took over the role from Frank Fay (American actor) Frank Fay and gained an increased Broadway theatre Broadway following in the unconventional play.<ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 214"/> The play, which ran for nearly three years with Stewart as its star, was successfully adapted into a 1950 Harvey (film) film, directed by Henry Koster, with Stewart reprising his role and Josephine Hull portraying his sister. Bing Crosby was the first choice, but he declined.<ref>Eliot 2006, pp. 208, 213.</ref> Stewart received his fourth Best Actor nomination for his performance.  Stewart also played the role on Broadway in 1970, which was shot on videotape for NBC as part of the Hallmark Hall of Fame series in 1972, and on the London stage in 1975.

After Harvey, the World War II film Malaya (film) Malaya (1949) with Spencer Tracy, and the conventional but highly successful biographical film The Stratton Story in 1949, Stewarts first pairing with "on-screen wife" June Allyson, his career took another turn.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 237.</ref> During the 1950s, he expanded into the Western movie Western and suspense genres, thanks to collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Mann.

Other performances by Stewart during this time include the critically acclaimed 1950 Delmer Daves Western Broken Arrow (1950 film) Broken Arrow, which featured Stewart as an ex-soldier and Indian agent making peace with the Apache; a troubled clown in the 1952 Academy Award for Best Picture Best Picture The Greatest Show on Earth (film) The Greatest Show on Earth; and Stewarts role as Charles Lindbergh in Billy Wilders 1957 The Spirit of St. Louis (film) The Spirit of St. Louis. He also starred in the Western radio show The Six Shooter for its one-season run from 1953 to 1954.

Cary Grant said of Stewarts acting technique:<blockquote>He had the ability to talk naturally. He knew that in conversations people do often interrupt one another and its not always so easy to get a thought out. It took a little time for the sound men to get used to him, but he had an enormous impact. And then, some years later, Marlon Brando Marlon came out and did the same thing all over again—but what people forget is that Jimmy did it first.<ref>{{cite web url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1997-07-06/entertainment/9707031555_1_jimmy-stewart-james-stewart-george-bailey title=Jimmy Stewart: The Biggest Little Man work=Orlando Sentinel}}</ref></blockquote>

==Collaborations with Hitchcock and Mann==
In Stewarts collaborations with director Anthony Mann, he entered the realm of the western movie western. Stewarts first appearance in a film directed by Mann came with the 1950 western, Winchester 73. In choosing Mann (after first choice Fritz Lang declined), Stewart cemented a powerful partnership.<ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 248">Eliot 2006, p. 248.</ref> The film, which became a box-office hit upon its release, set the pattern for their future collaborations. In it, Stewart is a tough, vengeful sharpshooter, the winner of a prized rifle which is stolen and then passes through many hands, until the showdown between Stewart and his brother (Stephen McNally).<ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 248" />

File:Nakedspur trailer 3.jpg thumb right Stewart made eight films for director Anthony Mann. Five of them were Western (genre) Westerns, including The Naked Spur (1953).

Other Stewart–Mann westerns, such as Bend of the River (1952), The Naked Spur (1953), The Far Country (1954) and The Man from Laramie (1955), were perennial favorites among young audiences entranced by the American West. Frequently, the films featured Stewart as a troubled cowboy seeking redemption, while facing corrupt cattlemen, ranchers and outlaws—a man who knows violence first hand and struggles to control it. The Stewart–Mann collaborations laid the foundation for many of the westerns of the 1950s and remain popular today for their grittier, more realistic depiction of the classic movie genre. Audiences saw Stewarts screen persona evolve into a more mature, more ambiguous, and edgier presence.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 251.</ref>

Stewart and Mann also collaborated on other films outside the western movie western genre. The Glenn Miller Story (1954) was critically acclaimed, garnering Stewart a BAFTA Award nomination, and (together with The Spirit of St. Louis) continued Stewarts portrayals of American heroes. Thunder Bay (film) Thunder Bay, released the same year, transplanted the plot arc of their western collaborations to a more contemporary setting, with Stewart as a Louisiana oil driller facing hostile fishermen. Strategic Air Command (film) Strategic Air Command, released in 1955, allowed Stewart to use his experiences in the United States Air Force on film.

Stewarts starring role in Winchester 73 was also a turning point in Hollywood. Universal Studios, who wanted Stewart to appear in both that film and Harvey, balked at his $200,000 asking price. His agent, Lew Wasserman, brokered an alternate deal, in which Stewart would appear in both films for no pay, in exchange for a percentage of the profits as well as cast and director approval.<ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 245">Eliot 2006, p. 245.</ref> Stewart ended up earning about $600,000 for Winchester 73 alone.<ref name="Eliot 2006, p. 245" /> Hollywoods other stars quickly capitalized on this new way of doing business, which further undermined the decaying "studio system".<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 254.</ref>

The second collaboration to define Stewarts career in the 1950s was with director Alfred Hitchcock. Like Mann, Hitchcock uncovered new depths to Stewarts acting, showing a protagonist confronting his fears and his repressed desires. Stewarts first movie with Hitchcock was the technologically innovative 1948 film Rope (film) Rope, shot in long "real time" takes.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 220.</ref>

File:James Stewart in Rear Window trailer 2.jpg left thumb Rear Window (1954) was one of four films Stewart made with Alfred Hitchcock. Stewart became the highest-grossing star of 1954 as a result.

The two collaborated for the second of four times on the 1954 hit Rear Window, widely considered one of Hitchcocks masterpieces. Stewart portrays photographer L.B. "Jeff" Jeffries, loosely based on Life (magazine) Life photographer Robert Capa, who projects his fantasies and fears onto the people he observes out his apartment window while on hiatus due to a broken leg. Jeffries gets into more than he can handle, however, when he believes he has witnessed a salesman (Raymond Burr) hiding evidence of a murder, and when his glamorous girlfriend (Grace Kelly), at first disdainful of his voyeurism and skeptical about any crime, eventually is drawn in and tries to help solve the mystery. Limited by his wheelchair, Stewart is led by Hitchcock to react to what his character sees with mostly facial responses. It was a landmark year for Stewart, becoming the highest grossing actor of 1954 and the most popular Hollywood star in the world, displacing John Wayne.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 278.</ref> Hitchcock and Stewart formed a corporation, Patron Inc., to produce the film, which later became the subject of a United States Supreme Court Supreme Court case Stewart v. Abend (1990).
File:Vertigo 1958 trailer embrace.jpg thumb With Kim Novak in Vertigo (film) Vertigo, 1958
After starring in Hitchcocks remake of the directors The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film) earlier production, The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film) The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), with Doris Day, Stewart starred, with Kim Novak, in what many consider Hitchcocks most personal film, Vertigo (film) Vertigo (1958).<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 310.</ref> The movie starred Stewart as John "Scottie" Ferguson, a former police investigator suffering from acrophobia, who develops an obsession with a woman he is shadowing. Scotties obsession inevitably leads to the destruction of everything he once had and believed in. Though the film is widely considered a classic today, Vertigo met with very mixed reviews and poor box-office receipts upon its release, and marked the last collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 321.</ref> The director reportedly blamed the films failure on Stewart looking too old to be Kim Novaks love interest, and cast Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill in North by Northwest (1959), a role Stewart had very much wanted. (Grant was actually four years older than Stewart but photographed much younger.) Critical appreciation of all three films continues to be strong. In 2012 Vertigo (film) Vertigo was ranked highest in the  Sight & Sound critics poll for the greatest films ever made, taking the title from long-standing favorite Citizen Kane.<ref name="bbc">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19078948 "Vertigo is named greatest film of all time{{"}}].

===Career in the 1960s and 1970s===
File:James Stewart - 1959.jpg thumb Anatomy of a Murder (1959)
In 1960, Stewart was awarded the New York Film Critics Circle Award for New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor Best Actor and received his fifth and final Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, for his role in the 1959 Otto Preminger film Anatomy of a Murder. This courtroom drama stars Stewart as Paul Biegler, the lawyer of a hot-tempered soldier (played by Ben Gazzara) who claims temporary insanity after murdering a tavern owner who raped his wife. The film featured a career-making performance by George C. Scott as the prosecutor. The film was considered quite explicit for its time, and it was a box-office success.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 332.</ref> Stewarts nomination was one of seven for the film (Charlton Heston was the winner with Ben-Hur), and saw his transition into the final decades of his career.

On January 1, 1960, Stewart received news of the death of Margaret Sullavan.<ref>Eliot 2006, p. 337.</ref> As a friend, mentor, and focus of his early romantic feelings, she had a unique influence on Stewarts life. On April 17, 1961, longtime friend Gary Cooper was too ill to attend the 33rd Academy Awards ceremony, so Stewart accepted the honorary Oscar on his behalf. Stewarts emotional speech hinted that something was seriously wrong, and the next day newspapers ran the headline, "Gary Cooper has cancer". One month later, on May 13, 1961, six days after his 60th birthday, Cooper died.

In the early 1960s, Stewart took leading roles in three John Ford films, his first work with the director. The first, Two Rode Together, paired him with Richard Widmark in a Western with thematic echoes of Fords The Searchers (film) The Searchers. The next, 1962s The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Stewarts first picture with John Wayne, is a classic "psychological" western, shot in black and white film noir style featuring powerful use of shadows in the climactic sequence, with Stewart as an Eastern attorney who goes against his non-violent principles when he is forced to confront a psychopathic outlaw (played by Lee Marvin) in a small frontier town. At storys end, Stewarts character — now a rising political figure — faces a difficult ethical choice as he attempts to reconcile his actions with his personal integrity. The films billing is unusual in that Stewart was given Billing (filmmaking) top billing over Wayne in the trailers and on the posters but Wayne was listed above Stewart in the film itself. The complex picture garnered mixed reviews but was an instant hit at the box office and became a critical favorite over the ensuing decades.

File:Westwon trailer Stewart.png thumb <center>How the West Was Won (film) How the West Was Won (1962)</center>
How the West Was Won (film) How the West Was Won (which Ford co-directed, though without directing Stewarts scenes) and Cheyenne Autumn were western epics released in 1962 and 1964 respectively. One of only a handful of movies filmed in true Cinerama, shot with three cameras and exhibited with three simultaneous projectors in theatres, How the West Was Won went on to win three Academy Awards Oscars and reap massive box-office figures. Cheyenne Autumn, in which a white-suited Stewart played Wyatt Earp in a long semi-comedic sequence in the middle of the movie, failed domestically and was quickly forgotten. The historical drama was Fords final Western and Stewarts last feature film with Ford. Stewarts entertainingly memorable middle sequence is not directly connected with the rest of the film and was often excised from the lengthy film in later theatrical exhibition prints and some television broadcasts.

Having played his last romantic lead in Bell, Book and Candle (1958), with Kim Novak, and silver-haired (although not all was his—he wore a partial hairpiece starting with Its a Wonderful Life and in every film thereafter), Stewart transitioned into more family-related films in the 1960s when he signed a multi-movie deal with 20th Century Fox. These included the successful Henry Koster outing Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation (1962), and the less memorable films Take Her, Shes Mine (1963) and Dear Brigitte (1965), which featured French model Brigitte Bardot as the object of Stewarts sons mash notes. The American Civil War Civil War period film Shenandoah (film) Shenandoah (1965) and the western movie western family film The Rare Breed fared better at the box office; the Civil War movie, with strong antiwar and humanitarian themes, was a hit in the South.{{citation needed date=February 2012}}

As an aviator, Stewart was particularly interested in aviation films and had pushed to appear in several in the 1950s, including No Highway in the Sky (1951), and Strategic Air Command (film) Strategic Air Command (1955) and The Spirit of St. Louis (film) The Spirit of St. Louis (1957). He continued in this vein in the 1960s, in a role as a hard-bitten pilot in The Flight of the Phoenix (1965 film) The Flight of the Phoenix (1965). Subbing for Stewart, famed stunt pilot and air racer Paul Mantz was killed when he crashed the "Tallmantz Phoenix P-1", the specially made, single-engined movie airplane, in an abortive "touch-and-go". Stewart also narrated the film X-15 (film) X-15 in 1961. In 1964, he and several other military aviators, including Curtis LeMay, Paul Tibbets, Bruce Sundlun and Arthur Godfrey, became the founding directors on the board of NetJets Executive Jet Aviation Corporation.<ref>"Paul Tibbets: A Rendezvous With History, Part 3".

After a progression of lesser western films in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Stewart transitioned from cinema to television. In the 1950s he had made guest appearances on the Jack Benny Program. Stewart first starred in the National Broadcasting Company NBC comedy The Jimmy Stewart Show, on which he played a college professor. He followed it with the Columbia Broadcasting Company CBS Mystery fiction mystery Hawkins (TV series) Hawkins, in which he played a small town lawyer investigating cases, similar to his character in Anatomy of a Murder. The series garnered Stewart a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Dramatic TV Series, but failed to gain a wide audience, possibly because it rotated with Shaft (TV series) Shaft, another high-quality series but with a starkly conflicting demographic, and was cancelled after one season. During this time, Stewart periodically appeared on Johnny Carsons The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson The Tonight Show, sharing poems he had written at different times in his life. His poems were later compiled into a short collection, Jimmy Stewart and His Poems (1989).<ref>Krier, Beth Ann.

Stewart returned to films after an absence of five years with a major supporting role in John Waynes final film, The Shootist (1976) where Stewart played a doctor giving Waynes gunfighter a terminal cancer diagnosis. At one point, both Wayne and Stewart were flubbing their lines repeatedly and Stewart turned to director Don Siegel and said, "Youd better get two better actors." Stewart also appeared in supporting roles in Airport 77, the 1978 remake of The Big Sleep (1978 film) The Big Sleep starring Robert Mitchum as Raymond Chandlers Philip Marlowe, and The Magic of Lassie (1978). All three movies received poor reviews, and The Magic of Lassie flopped at the box office.

Paul arranged for Stewart, through the offices of President Boris Yeltsin, to send a special print of Its a Wonderful Life, translated by Lomonosov Moscow State University, to Russia as the first American program ever to be broadcast on Russian television. It first aired on Russian TV Channel 2 on January 5, 1992, the first day of the existence of the Commonwealth of Independent States and  two days before Russian Orthodox Church Russian Orthodox Christmas.

In association with politicians and celebrities such as President Ronald Reagan, Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger, California Governor George Deukmejian, Bob Hope and Charlton Heston, Stewart worked from 1987 to 1993 on projects that enhanced the public appreciation and understanding of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.

In 1991, James Stewart voiced the character of Sheriff Wylie Burp in the movie An American Tail: Fievel Goes West, which was his last film role. Shortly before his 80th birthday, he was asked how he wanted to be remembered. "As someone who believed in hard work and love of country, love of family and love of community."<ref name="Hesitant Hero">[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0520.html "Obituary: James Stewart, the hesitant hero, dies at 89"].

After World War II, Stewart settled down, at age 41, marrying former model Gloria Hatrick McLean on August 9, 1949.

One of Stewarts lesser-known talents was his homespun poetry. Once, while on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, he read a poem entitled "Beau (poem) Beau" that he had written about his dog.

Following the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, Stewart, Charlton Heston, Kirk Douglas and Gregory Peck issued a statement calling for support of President Lyndon B. Johnson Lyndon Johnsons Gun Control Act of 1968.

One of his best friends was fellow actor Henry Fonda, despite the fact that the pair had very different political ideologies. A political argument in 1947 resulted in a fistfight, but they maintained their friendship by never discussing politics again.<ref>Robbins 1985, p. 99.</ref> This tale may be apocryphal as Jhan Robbins quotes Stewart as saying: "Our views never interfered with our feelings for each other, we just didnt talk about certain things. I cant remember ever having an argument with him—ever!" However, Jane Fonda told Donald Dewey for his 1996 biography of Stewart that her father did have a falling out with Stewart at that time, although she did not know whether it was because of their political differences. There is a brief reference to their political differences in character in their film The Cheyenne Social Club. In the last years of his life, he donated to the campaign of Bob Dole for the United States presidential election, 1996 1996 presidential election and to Democratic Florida governor Bob Graham in his successful run for the Senate.<ref name="Political Donations"/>
