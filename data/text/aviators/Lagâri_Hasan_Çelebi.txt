Lagâri Hasan Çelebi was an Ottoman Empire Ottoman Aviation aviator who, according to a sole account written by traveller Evliya Çelebi, made a successful manned rocket flight.

==Account==
Evliya Çelebi reported that in 1633, Lagari Hasan Çelebi launched in a 7-winged rocket using 50 Oka (mass) okka (140&nbsp;lbs) of gunpowder from Sarayburnu, the point below Topkapı Palace in Istanbul. The flight was said to be undertaken at the time of the birth of Sultan of the Ottoman Empire sultan Murad IVs daughter. As Evliya Celebi wrote, Lagari proclaimed before launch "O my sultan! Be blessed, I am going to talk to Jesus!"; after ascending in the rocket, he landed in the sea, swimming ashore and joking "O my sultan! Jesus sends his regards to you!"; he was rewarded by the Sultan with silver and the rank of sipahi in the Ottoman army.<ref>Winter, Frank H. (1992).

Evliya Çelebi also wrote of Lagaris brother, Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi, making a flight by glider (aircraft) glider a year earlier.

==Popular culture==
Istanbul Beneath My Wings is a 1996 film about the lives of Lagari Hasan Çelebi, his brother and fellow aviator Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi, and Ottoman society in the early 17th century as witnessed and narrated by Evliya Çelebi.

The legend was addressed in an experiment by the television show MythBusters, on November 11, 2009, in the episode "MythBusters (2009 season)#ep130 Crash and Burn"; however, the team noted that Evliya Çelebi had not sufficiently specified the alleged design used by Lagâri Hasan and said that it would have been "extremely difficult" for a 17th-century figure, unequipped with modern steel alloys and welding, to land safely or even achieve thrust at all.<ref name="MythBustersCrashAndBurn">{{Cite episode  title=Crash and Burn  episodelink=MythBusters (2009 season)#ep130  url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1548139/  accessdate=31 December 2013  series=MythBusters  serieslink=MythBusters  network=Discovery Channel  date=11 November 2009  season=7  number=17  minutes=  time=00:05:35, 00:42:54, and 00:43:11  transcript=Transcript  transcripturl=http://livedash.ark.com/transcript/mythbusters-%28crash_and_burn%29/6222/DSCP/Saturday_December_05_2009/122354/  quote=So, unfortunately with myths of this kind, theres no one single version of the story, which means that theres no one definitive rocket design for us to build. ... First of all, the 140 pounds of black powder that hes supposed to have used as his propellant would have been extremely dangerous to handle, not to mention containing all of that explosive force and converting it to thrust would have been extremely difficult. ... And second, the materials that we have available today, all the modern steel alloys, and all the fabrication techniques, like welding — he didnt have any of that.}}</ref> Although the re-imagined rocket rose, it exploded midflight.<ref name="MythBustersCrashAndBurn" />
