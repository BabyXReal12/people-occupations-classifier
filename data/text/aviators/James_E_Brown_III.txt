==Early life==
James Brown III was born in Bluefield, West Virginia on August 15, 1954, and grew up in Birmingham, Alabama.{{sfn Reynolds 2012}} His interest in flying developed with help from his father, who was an amateur pilot. The young man dreamed of one day becoming an astronaut.<!--kinda flowery, no?--> He attended the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington, Virginia and graduated in 1976 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering.{{sfn Karlin 2008}} Browns first solo flight occurred in February 1976.{{sfn Rodela 2006}}

==Military career==
After graduating from VMI, Brown was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant#United States Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force.{{sfn Rogers 2006}} He entered the Air Education and Training Command#Flying training Undergraduate Pilot Training program in 1977{{sfn Karlin 2008}} and earned his U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating pilot wings the following year.{{sfn Rogers 2006}} Browns first operational tour began in 1979 with the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the 52d Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem Air Base in West Germany where he flew the F-4 Phantom II. On his next tour, Brown flew the Northrop F-5 F-5E Tiger II with the 527th Space Aggressor Squadron 527th Aggressor Squadron at RAF Alconbury Royal Air Force station Alconbury in England.{{sfn Crickmore 2003 p=144}}

In 1985, he was selected to attend the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (TPS) at Edwards Air Force Base in California and graduated with Class 86A.<ref name=TPS50_p108>{{cite book  title = USAF Test Pilot School 50 Years and Beyond  year=1994  page = 108}}</ref> His fellow students presented Brown with the Onizuka Prop Wash Award as the student who contributed most to class spirit and morale.<ref name=TPS50_p220>{{cite book  title = USAF Test Pilot School 50 Years and Beyond  year=1994  page = 220}}</ref> The Prop Wash Award is dedicated to the memory of TPS graduate Colonel Ellison Onizuka who died as a member of the crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986.<ref name=TPS50_p220/> Following graduation, Brown tested the A-7 Corsair II, all models of the F-15 Eagle, and performed flight trials on a number of classified prototype aircraft. In 1992, after sixteen years of service, Brown separated from the Air Force.{{sfn Rogers 2006}}

==Civilian career==
Brown interviewed with Lockheed Corporation Lockheed for a test pilot position but, because of reduced military spending after the end of the Cold War, no openings were available. He joined United Airlines in 1992 and flew the Boeing 737 over North and Central America. Pursuing his boyhood dream, Brown applied to the NASA astronaut-training program but was rejected because of an abnormal electrocardiogram.{{sfn Karlin 2008}}

===F-117 Nighthawk===

In 1994, he was hired by the Lockheed Skunk Works as a test pilot for the F-117 Nighthawk, where he helped develop and test improvements to the weapons system that proved valuable in Operation Allied Force and Operation Iraqi Freedom.{{sfn Rodela 2006}} One such improvement was the Integrated Real-time Information into the Cockpit/Real-time Information Out of the Cockpit for Combat Aircraft (IRRCA) project. In 1998 as IRRCA lead test pilot, Brown flew a simulated combat mission to demonstrate the ability to receive real-time mission updates from a satellite and automatically alter the F-117s planned route.{{sfn Crickmore 2003 p=143}}<ref name=F117_IRRCA>{{cite news title=F-117 testers evaluate real-time information capability  url=http://www.edwards.af.mil/archive/1998/9809_F117.html  work=Desert Wings  publisher=USAF Flight Test Center Public Affairs  location=Edwards Air Force Base, California  date=September 1998  accessdate=January 13, 2010  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901182557/http://www.edwards.af.mil/archive/1998/9809_F117.html  archivedate=September  1, 2006  deadurl=yes  df= }}</ref> The flight also demonstrated reception of text and imagery of the alternate target.{{sfn Crickmore 2003 p=143}} Brown encouraged young engineers by presenting lectures such as Braking the F-117 Stealth Fighter given to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics student chapter at the University of California, San Diego.{{sfn Lowry 1999}} He continued his education and earned a Master of Science degree in Management from Troy University Troy State University in Alabama and completed graduate study in mechanical engineering at California State University, Fresno.{{sfn Rogers 2006}}

===F-22 Raptor===

In 2002, after eight years with F-117 program, Brown transferred to the F-22 Raptor.{{sfn Rodela 2006}} In this new role, he evaluated updated versions of the avionics software and improved the pilot-vehicle interface.{{sfn Karlin 2008}} On November 22, 2002, Brown flew the mission that completed all Pentagon-mandated flight test goals needed to start the next phase of the program.<ref name=Raptor_Test_Goals>{{cite book  title=F/A-22 Raptor Meets Programs Final 2002 Flight-Test Goal  year = 2002}}</ref>{{sfn Bierstine 2002}} On this mission, Brown fired an AIM-9 Sidewinder AIM-9M Sidewinder missile at a supersonic QF-4 unmanned drone flying several miles directly ahead of the F-22.<ref name=Raptor_Test_Goals/> The unarmed missile passed close enough to the target to be assessed a lethal hit, satisfying the criteria needed to start the Dedicated Initial Operational Test & Evaluation (DIOTE) phase the following year.<ref name=Raptor_Test_Goals/>{{sfn Bierstine 2002}}

Brown has successfully dealt with many F-22 emergencies including a fuel leak at 30,000 feet while traveling at nearly the speed of sound.{{sfn Puckett 2005}} On another flight, a mechanical problem affected one of the two jet engines shortly after take off. Aware of a similar situation that resulted in the loss of an F-117, Brown idled the ailing engine rather than shut it down. The second engine began losing power during the landing approach. Browns unconventional technique to handling the initial problem allowed him to narrowly avoid a much more serious situation.{{sfn Karlin 2008}}

{{As of 2006}}, Brown has been the lead test pilot for the F-22 Raptor program at Edwards Air Force Base.{{sfn Rodela 2006}} As of 2008, Brown has logged over 7,600 flight hours in 124 different types of aircraft.{{sfn Karlin 2008}} In July 2011, Brown was promoted to Chief Test Pilot of the F-22 Raptor program for Lockheed Martin. In 2012, he became the first test pilot to reach 1,000 flight hours in the F-22. Including his hours in the F-117, Brown has more flight time in stealth jets than any other pilot in the world.{{sfn Reynolds 2012}} 

===Skunk Works and later===
In 2013, Brown accepted the position of Chief of Flight Operations for the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works providing flight test oversight for evaluations of new technologies.{{sfn Reynolds 2015}} Brown retired from Lockheed in January 2016 and joined the National Test Pilot School as chief operations officer and test pilot instructor.<ref name=NTPS>{{cite web  title = James E.
