==Professional career==
===1968–1970===
Munson was selected by the Yankees with the fourth overall pick in the 1968 Major League Baseball draft. In his only full minor league season, he batted .301 with six home runs and 37 runs batted in for the Binghamton Triplets in their final season ({{baseball year 1968}}), and made his first appearance in Yankee Stadium (1923) Yankee Stadium in August 1968, when the Triplets came to play an exhibition game against the Yankees.<ref>{{harvp Appel 2009 pp=7–8}}</ref> He was batting .363 for the Syracuse Chiefs in {{baseball year 1969}} when he earned a promotion to the New York Yankees.

Munson made his major league debut on August 8, 1969, in the second game of a Doubleheader (baseball) doubleheader against the Oakland Athletics.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA196908082.shtml title=New York Yankees 5, Oakland As 0 date=1969-08-08 publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> Munson went two for three with a walk (baseball) walk, one RBI and two runs scored.

He made 97 plate appearances, but drew ten walks and had one sacrifice fly, which gave him 86 official at bats, and allowed him to go into the {{baseball year 1970}} season still technically a rookie.

The Yankees used the pair of Jake Gibbs and Frank Fernández (baseball) Frank Fernández at catcher for most of 1969. During the off season, the Yankees dealt Fernández to the As. Munson responded by batting .302 with seven home runs and 57 RBI, and making 80 assists en route to receiving the 1970 American League Rookie of the Year award.

===1971–1974===
Munson received his first of seven All-Star nods in {{baseball year 1971}}, catching the last two innings without an at-bat.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ALS/ALS197107130.shtml title=1971 All-Star Game date=1971-07-13 publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> An outstanding fielder, Munson committed only one error (baseball) error all season. It occurred on June 18 against the Baltimore Orioles when opposing catcher Andy Etchebarren knocked Munson unconscious on a play at the plate, dislodging the ball.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BAL/BAL197106180.shtml title=Baltimore Orioles 6, New York Yankees 4 date=1971-06-18 publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> He also only allowed nine passed balls all season and caught 36 of a potential 59 Stolen base base stealers for a 61% caught stealing percentage.

Munson was known for his longstanding feud with Boston Red Sox counterpart Carlton Fisk.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.thedeadballera.com/MunsonFisk.html title=The Munson/Fisk Rivalry accessdate=2009-11-25}}</ref> One particular incident that typified their feud, and the Yankees&nbsp;– Red Sox rivalry in general, occurred on August 1, {{baseball year 1973}} at Fenway Park. With the score tied at 2–2 in the top of the ninth and runners on first and third, Munson attempted to score from third on Gene Michaels missed bunt attempt.

As Red Sox pitcher John Curtis (baseball) John Curtis let his first pitch go, Munson broke for the plate. Michael tried to bunt, and missed. With Munson coming, Fisk elbowed the Yankee shortstop out of the way and braced for Munson, who barreled into Fisk.  Fisk held onto the ball, but Munson remained tangled with Fisk as Felipe Alou, who was on first, attempted to advance.  The confrontation at the plate triggered a ten-minute bench-clearing brawl in which both catchers were ejected.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS197308010.shtml title=Boston Red Sox 3, New York Yankees 2 date=1973-08-01 publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref>

Munson made his second All-Star team and won his first of three straight Gold Glove Awards in 1973. He also emerged as more of a slugger for the Yankees, batting .300 for the first time since 1970, and hitting a career high twenty home runs. In {{baseball year 1974}}, Munson was elected to start his first of three consecutive All-Star games, going one for three with a walk and a run scored.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NLS/NLS197407230.shtml title=1974 All-Star Game date=1974-07-23 publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref>

===1975–1976===
Munson batted a career high .318 in {{baseball year 1975}}, which was third in the league behind Rod Carew and Fred Lynn. For the start of the {{baseball year 1976}} season, Munson was named the first List of New York Yankees team captains Yankees team captain since Lou Gehrig retired in {{baseball year 1939}}. He responded by batting .302 with 17 home runs and 105 RBI to receive the American League MVP Award and lead the Yankees to their first World Series appearance since {{wsy 1964}}. He batted .435 with three RBI and three runs scored in the 1976 American League Championship Series American League Championship Series against the 1976 Kansas City Royals season Kansas City Royals, and batted .529 with two RBI and two runs scored in the 1976 World Series World Series against the 1976 Cincinnati Reds season Cincinnati Reds. Already down three games to none, Munson went four for four in the final game of the Series at Yankee Stadium (1923) Yankee Stadium, but New York was swept by the "Big Red Machine." Combined with the hits he got in his final two at bats in game three, his six consecutive hits tied a World Series record set by Goose Goslin of the 1924 Washington Senators season Washington Senators in {{wsy 1924}}.

Reds catcher Johnny Bench was named the World Series MVP in 1976. A fairly obvious comparison of opposing backstops was made to Reds Manager (baseball) manager Sparky Anderson during the post-World Series press conference, to which, Anderson responded, "Munson is an outstanding ballplayer and he would hit .300 in the National League, but you dont ever compare anybody to Johnny Bench. Dont never embarrass nobody by comparing them to Johnny Bench." Munson was visibly upset by these comments when he got on the mic shortly afterwards.<ref>All Roads Lead to October (chapter 10) by Maury Allen, St. Martins Press 2000 {{ISBN 0-312-26175-6}}</ref>

===1977–1979===
Munson batted .308 with 100 RBI in 1977 New York Yankees season 1977, giving him three consecutive seasons batting .300 or better with 100 or more RBI each year. He was the first catcher to accomplish the feat in three consecutive years since Yankee MLB Hall of Fame Hall of Famer Bill Dickeys four straight seasons from {{baseball year 1936}}-1939, matched only by Mike Piazza since ({{baseball year 1996}}–{{baseball year 1998}}). The Yankees repeated as 1977 American League Championship Series American League Champions, and faced the 1977 Los Angeles Dodgers season Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1977 World Series World Series. Munson batted .320 with a home run and three RBI in the Yankees four games to two victory over the Dodgers. The Dodgers had stolen 114 bases during the regular season, yet Munson caught four of six potential base stealers in the first four games of the series to keep the speedy Dodgers grounded in the final two.

In 1978 New York Yankees season 1978, the Yankees and 1978 Kansas City Royals season Royals faced each other for the third consecutive time in the 1978 American League Championship Series ALCS. Tied at a game apiece, and trailing {{nowrap 5–4}} in the bottom of the eighth inning of game three, Munson hit the longest home run of his career, a{{convert 475 ft adj=on}} shot off Doug Bird over Yankee Stadiums Monument Park in left-center field, to give the Yankees a {{nowrap 6–5 win.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA197810060.shtml title=1978 American League Championship Series Game Three date=1978-10-06 publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref>}} They won the pennant the next day, and went on to beat the 1978 Los Angeles Dodgers season Dodgers again in the 1978 World Series World Series in six games, winning the final four. Munson batted .320 (8-for-25) with 7 RBIs in this Series and also caught Ron Ceys foul pop-up for the final out.

Munsons World Series championships in 1977 and 1978 made him only the second catcher in baseball history, at the time, to win a Rookie of the Year Award, an MVP Award, a Gold Glove Award, and a World Series title during his career.  Johnny Bench had become the first catcher to win all four of these awards when he won his own World Series titles with the Reds in 1975 and 1976.  Subsequently, and more recently, when Buster Posey won his first Gold Glove Award in 2016 he also joined this list of three catchers in all of baseball history to win all four awards.  But as a further point on unique contributions to the game, since Posey and Munson both were named as College Baseball All-Americans based upon their collegiate baseball careers, they now share the additional distinction of being the only two Catchers in history named to an All-American Team who also own a ROY, MVP, GG, and World Series Title.

The Yankees had lost three in a row, and were in fourth place, eleven games behind the 1979 Baltimore Orioles season Baltimore Orioles in the American League East heading into the All-Star break in 1979 New York Yankees season 1979. Despite a .288 average, the wear-and-tear of catching was beginning to take its toll on Munson, and he was overlooked for the Major League Baseball All-Star Game American League All-Star team. Frequently homesick, he had a well-known desire to play for the Cleveland Indians in order to be closer to his family in Canton,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.nj.com/yankees/index.ssf/2009/08/catcher_thurman_munson_the_cap.html title=Catcher Thurman Munson, The Captain, was heart and soul of the NY Yankees date=2009-08-01}}</ref> and was also considering retiring at the end of the season.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation into the crash stated that the probable cause was "...the pilots failure to recognize the need for, and to take action to maintain, sufficient airspeed to prevent a stall into the ground during an attempted landing. The pilot also failed to recognize the need for timely and sufficient power application to prevent the stall during an approach conducted inadvertently without flaps extended. Contributing to the pilots inability to recognize the problem and to take proper action was his failure to use the appropriate checklist and his nonstandard pattern procedures which resulted in an abnormal approach profile." Munson was not wearing the available shoulder harness restraint, only a lap belt, which contributed to the severity of his injuries.<ref name=ntsbapr80/>

On August 1, {{baseball year 1980}}, the day before the first anniversary of the accident, the Yankees filed a $4.5-million lawsuit against Cessna Aircraft Co. and Flight Safety International, Inc.

Munsons widow, Diana, also filed a $42.2 million wrongful death lawsuit against the two companies. Cessna offered Munson a special deal on flying lessons if he would take them from FlightSafety International. Rather than requiring Munson to take a two-week safety class in Kansas, FlightSafety assigned a "traveling instructor" to go on the road with him, and train him between ballgames.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/nyregion/follow-up-on-the-news-munson-case.html title=Follow-Up on the News; Munson Case date=1982-05-02 work=The New York Times   first=Richard   last=Haitch   accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref> The suit was eventually settled out of court.
