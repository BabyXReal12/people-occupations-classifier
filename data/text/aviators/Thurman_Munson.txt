One particular incident that typified their feud, and the Yankees – Red Sox rivalry in general, occurred on August 1, {{baseball year 1973}} at Fenway Park. With the score tied at 2–2 in the top of the ninth and runners on first and third, Munson attempted to score from third on Gene Michaels missed bunt attempt.

As Red Sox pitcher John Curtis (baseball) John Curtis let his first pitch go, Munson broke for the plate. Michael tried to bunt, and missed.

Combined with the hits he got in his final two at bats in game three, his six consecutive hits tied a World Series record set by Goose Goslin of the 1924 Washington Senators season Washington Senators in {{wsy 1924}}.

Reds catcher Johnny Bench was named the World Series MVP in 1976. A fairly obvious comparison of opposing backstops was made to Reds Manager (baseball) manager Sparky Anderson during the post-World Series press conference, to which, Anderson responded, "Munson is an outstanding ballplayer and he would hit .300 in the National League, but you dont ever compare anybody to Johnny Bench. Dont never embarrass nobody by comparing them to Johnny Bench." Munson was visibly upset by these comments when he got on the mic shortly afterwards.
===1977–1979===
Munson batted .308 with 100 RBI in 1977 New York Yankees season 1977, giving him three consecutive seasons batting .300 or better with 100 or more RBI each year.

The Yankees repeated as 1977 American League Championship Series American League Champions, and faced the 1977 Los Angeles Dodgers season Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1977 World Series World Series. Munson batted .320 with a home run and three RBI in the Yankees four games to two victory over the Dodgers. The Dodgers had stolen 114 bases during the regular season, yet Munson caught four of six potential base stealers in the first four games of the series to keep the speedy Dodgers grounded in the final two.

In 1978 New York Yankees season 1978, the Yankees and 1978 Kansas City Royals season Royals faced each other for the third consecutive time in the 1978 American League Championship Series ALCS. Tied at a game apiece, and trailing {{nowrap 5–4}} in the bottom of the eighth inning of game three, Munson hit the longest home run of his career, a{{convert 475 ft adj=on}} shot off Doug Bird over Yankee Stadiums Monument Park in left-center field, to give the Yankees a {{nowrap 6–5 win.
}} They won the pennant the next day, and went on to beat the 1978 Los Angeles Dodgers season Dodgers again in the 1978 World Series World Series in six games, winning the final four. Munson batted .320 (8-for-25) with 7 RBIs in this Series and also caught Ron Ceys foul pop-up for the final out.

Munsons World Series championships in 1977 and 1978 made him only the second catcher in baseball history, at the time, to win a Rookie of the Year Award, an MVP Award, a Gold Glove Award, and a World Series title during his career.  Johnny Bench had become the first catcher to win all four of these awards when he won his own World Series titles with the Reds in 1975 and 1976.  Subsequently, and more recently, when Buster Posey won his first Gold Glove Award in 2016 he also joined this list of three catchers in all of baseball history to win all four awards.  But as a further point on unique contributions to the game, since Posey and Munson both were named as College Baseball All-Americans based upon their collegiate baseball careers, they now share the additional distinction of being the only two Catchers in history named to an All-American Team who also own a ROY, MVP, GG, and World Series Title.

The Yankees had lost three in a row, and were in fourth place, eleven games behind the 1979 Baltimore Orioles season Baltimore Orioles in the American League East heading into the All-Star break in 1979 New York Yankees season 1979. Despite a .288 average, the wear-and-tear of catching was beginning to take its toll on Munson, and he was overlooked for the Major League Baseball All-Star Game American League All-Star team. Frequently homesick, he had a well-known desire to play for the Cleveland Indians in order to be closer to his family in Canton,
and was also considering retiring at the end of the season. At the end of July, the Yankees were still in fourth place at {{winning percentage 57 48 record=y}}, fourteen games behind {{nowrap Baltimore.
