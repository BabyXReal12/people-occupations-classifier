Professionally, Jolies status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Beowulf (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,<ref>{{cite news   last=Seiler   first=Andy   last2=Snider   first2=Mike   url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/2001-06-15-lara-croft.htm   newspaper=USA Today   title=Lara Crofts greatest leap   date=June 15, 2001   accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web   url=http://www.vulture.com/2007/11/sure_beowulf_is_a_technologica.html   title=Yes, Beowulf Is a Technological Marvel — But How Does Angelina Jolie Look Naked?   publisher=Vulture (website) Vulture   date=November 16, 2007   accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref> with Empire stating that her "pneumatic figure", "feline eyes", and "bee-stung lips" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.<ref name="Empire sexiest">{{cite magazine   url= http://www.empireonline.com/100sexiest/default.asp?star=1   archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120310214149/http://www.empireonline.com/100sexiest/default.asp?star=1   dead-url= yes   archive-date= March 10, 2012   title=Angelina Jolie Sexiest Movie Star Ever   magazine=Empire   date=December 5, 2007   accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref> Conversely, Salon writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolies "dark and intense sexuality" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional womens roles,<ref name="Salon"/> while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in Changeling (2008), opined that having "the most beautiful face on the planet" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.<ref>{{cite news   url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/film/beautiful-face-hampers-jolie-eastwood/2008/10/06/1223145233452.html   newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald publisher=Australian Associated Press   title= Beautiful face hampers Jolie: Eastwood  date=October 6, 2008   accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref>

Beyond her career, Jolies appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large.
