{{Main Telly Addicts}}
Telly Addicts was a BBC1 game show hosted by Edmonds, broadcast from 3 September 1985 until 29 July 1998. Questions were based on past and present television programmes, and generally took the form of a short clip being shown followed by a series of questions either specifically about the clip or more generally about the programme from which it had been taken. Two teams sat opposite each other on sofas. In 1991 he presented a prime time series called Noels Addicts, but this show had no similarity to the Telly Addicts format and only ran for one series.

===Noels Saturday Roadshow===
{{Main Noels Saturday Roadshow}}
Noels Saturday Roadshow was Noels second BBC television light entertainment show, broadcast live on Saturday evenings from 3 September 1988 to 15 December 1990.<ref>{{cite web  work=Off The Telly  title=The Glory Game - The Rise And Rise Of Saturday Night Telly  url=http://offthetelly.co.uk/lightentertainment/glorygame/part15.htm   accessdate=10 September 2006  archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041118201432/http://offthetelly.co.uk/lightentertainment/glorygame/part15.htm  archivedate = 18 November 2004}}</ref>
Presented by Edmonds, it was his first major TV project since the demise of The Late, Late Breakfast Show two years earlier. The programme contained several elements found in its predecessor, such as phone-in quizzes, celebrity interviews and bands performing in the studio.
The premise for the new show was that unlike The Late Late Breakfast Show, which had been broadcast from the BBCs studios each week, the Roadshow would come from a new, different and exotic location each week. These locations were in fact elaborate studio sets dressed to resemble each weeks location, such as the North Pole, a space station, Hollywood, Niagara Falls.  The irony of this was not lost on Edmonds, whose self-deprecating presentation style frequently made light of the low-budget production values.

The programme was a slow-burning success and, following the third series in 1990, Edmonds popularity and reputation were sufficiently re-established with the public for Edmonds to pitch Noels House Party to the BBC.

The show introduced regular features such as the Gunge Tank, the Gotcha Oscars and Wait Til I Get You Home, which would all be carried across and subsequently developed in House Party. Another item was "Clown court", in which a guest actor from a TV series would be on trial for all the bloopers made during the shooting of that show, for example Sylvester McCoy for the title role of Doctor Who, and Tony Robinson for his character of Baldrick in Blackadder the Third.

===Noels House Party===
{{Main Noels House Party}}
By 1991, the Saturday Roadshow morphed into Noels House Party, which ran for eight years, supposedly from Edmonds mansion in the fictional town of Crinkley Bottom. Regular features included NTV, in which cameras were secretly hiddenly in viewers homes, often in VHS tape cases. There was also the "Gotchas", with celebrities  caught in elaborate and embarrassing set-up situations.

In one incident NTVs hidden cameras caught celebrity psychic Uri Geller apparently bending a spoon with his hands while demonstrating his "powers" to a member of the public. When then-Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis was "Gotchad infamously yelled "You are a dead man!" He later participated when Edmonds himself was "Gotchad". Mr Blobby, a pink and yellow spotted character, initially appeared in the "Gotcha" section, and became a regular feature of the programme. The character even achieved the List of Christmas number one singles 1993 Christmas No. 1.<ref>{{cite web  work=Everything2  title=UK Number One singles of 1993  url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1341888  accessdate=10 September 2006}}</ref>

Noels House Party was a staple of BBC One BBC1s autumn and spring schedules for more than eight years. Several reformats failed to reverse its declining popularity, and in the final programme, broadcast on 20 March 1999, Edmonds appealed that viewers memories should be kind to the programme.<ref>{{cite web   work=TV Cream   title=The TV Cream Guide to Television Presenters   url=http://tv.cream.org/specialassignments/presenters/e.htm   accessdate=12 September 2006   deadurl=yes   archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014025650/http://tv.cream.org/specialassignments/presenters/e.htm   archivedate=14 October 2006   df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===TV licence boycott===
Edmonds claimed that he had stopped payment on his Television license TV licence in early 2008, in response to the sometimes controversial methods used to enforce collection of the licence. Edmonds declared that it is wrong to "threaten" and "badger" people, in response to the collection authoritys common assumption that the non-possession of a licence can mean licence evasion, as well as the large fines which can be used as enforcement for non-payment.<ref>{{Cite news  work=BBC News title= Edmonds begins TV licence boycott url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7613938.stm date=13 September 2008  accessdate=13 September 2008   location=London}}</ref> TV Licensing later claimed that he did possess a valid current TV licence, but this claim was denied by a spokesman for Edmonds who said that TV Licensing had their facts wrong.<ref>{{Cite news  work=BBC News title=Edmonds does have a TV licence url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7623684.stm date=18 September 2008  accessdate=21 September 2008   location=London}}</ref>

==Spiritualism==
For many years Edmonds has been a believer in Spiritualism, in particular the concept of cosmic ordering, a subject he became interested in after being introduced to Bärbel Mohrs book The Cosmic Ordering Service - A Guide to Realising Your Dreams by his Reflexology reflexologist.<ref>{{cite news last=Leonard first=Tom url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/alternative-medicine/3338065/Need-a-lover-or-a-house-Call-on-the-cosmos.html title=Need a lover or a house?

Edmonds said in 2008 that he is constantly accompanied by two melon-sized "spiritual energy" balls, which appear over his shoulders and which he believes to be the spirits of his dead parents. "Orbs are little bundles of positive energy and they think they can move between 500 and 1,000 miles per hour," according to Edmonds. "They look like little round planets but they come in all shapes and sizes."<ref>{{cite news last=Alleyne first=Richard url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/profiles/2967913/Profile-Noel-Edmonds.html title=Profile: Noel Edmonds work=The Daily Telegraph location=London date=16 September 2008 accessdate=8 June 2016}}</ref> He has asserted that the orbs appear only on digital photographs.<ref>{{cite news last=McSmith first=Andy url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/whats-eating-noel-edmonds-931994.html title=Whats eating Noel Edmonds? work=The Independent date=15 September 2008 accessdate=8 June 2016}}</ref>

In August 2015, Edmonds gave an interview to the Daily Mirror in which he stated that the greatest problem facing humanity was "electrosmog" due to Wi-Fi and other "systems", causing the destruction of "our natural electro-magnetic fields". He also stated a belief that death was impossible because the body was merely a container for "a universal energy", and that this had "been known for a very long time". When he dies, Edmonds anticipates that "My energy will return to where it came from - part of a massive, incomprehensible universal web of energy".<ref>{{cite web last=Mandle first=Chris title=Noel Edmonds says death doesnt exist and electrosmog is more deadly than Ebola or AIDs.

==EMP Pad==
On 7 June 2016, Edmonds claimed on Twitter that an Electromagnetic Pulse device costing £2,315 was "A simple box that slows ageing, reduces pain, lifts depression and stress and tackles cancer. Yep tackles cancer!".<ref name="Telegraph070616">{{cite news url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/07/noel-edmonds-investigated-by-advertising-watchdog-after-endorsin/ title=Noel Edmonds suggests cancer sufferers ill health is caused by his negative attitude work=The Daily Telegraph location=London date=7 June 2016 accessdate=8 June 2016}}</ref><ref name="BBC070616"/> Edmonds provoked further criticism after tweeting to a man with kidney cancer, lymph node metastases and psoriatic arthritis that "Scientific fact-disease is caused by negative energy.

He claimed that a "very stressful, very negative period" in life had caused his prostate cancer, "I was, I thought, very, very healthy. I know why I got my cancer... the definition of stress is negative energy. It didnt just decide to manifest itself, there was cause". He went on to add "I then had my tumour destroyed by sound waves, proving yet again energy is at the heart of this issue" and reiterated that "I believe pulsed electromagnetism has a role to play in tackling cancer and I will always believe that".<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/08/noel-edmonds-my-dad-died-of-ignorance-i-got-prostate-cancer-beca/ title=Noel Edmonds: My dad died of ignorance, I got prostate cancer because of stress last=Yorke first=Harry date=8 June 2016 work=The Daily Telegraph accessdate=8 June 2016 location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14543938.Noel_Edmonds_reveals_prostate_cancer_diagnosis_as_he_defends_cancer_caused_by__negative_attitude__tweets/ title=Noel Edmonds reveals prostate cancer diagnosis as he defends cancer caused by negative attitude tweets date=8 June 2016 work=The Herald accessdate=8 June 2016 location=Glasgow}}</ref>

In response, the firm responsible for the device, EMP Pad Limited, said it did not agree with his claim "in any way, shape or form", and that they had not paid him in relation to it. While EMP Pad Limited said it did not pay Edmonds to promote the product, the companys owner Maria Robertson, previously worked as an assistant to the TV presenter and acknowledged having known Edmonds for 25 years and having worked with him and his daughter.<ref name="BBC070616">{{cite news url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36470979 title=Noel Edmonds cancer box claim dismissed by firm publisher=BBC News date=7 June 2016 accessdate=8 June 2016}}</ref> Cancer Research UK produced an article to reassure the public that "the best studies looking at this topic have failed to show a link between emotional stress and an increased risk of cancer" and that "no reliable evidence has ever been produced that Rife machine Rife machines – or any similar devices producing low-frequency electromagnetic pulses – have any benefit for cancer patients.

The result might be that some desperate patients believe them, and choose the nonsense over the best that real medicine has to offer. And that could hasten deaths.”<ref name=":0" />

The UKs Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom) Advertising Standards Authority said that it was "urgently looking into" a complaint made over the claims, because advertising any proven or unproven cancer treatment would violate the Cancer Act 1939 if payments had been made.<ref name="Telegraph070616" /> Later, the ASA said that no rules had been broken.<ref name="BBC070616" /> The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said that it was investigating the products available from EMP Pad "to determine whether there are any breaches of the Medical Device Regulations 2002".<ref name="BBC070616" />

In June 2017, Edmonds said he attempted suicide after fraud by a group of HBOS financiers destroyed his Unique Group business: "Until these criminals took me to the brink of emotional annihilation, I had always felt those who opt out by taking their own lives were selfish and cowardly...
