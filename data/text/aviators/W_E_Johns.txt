William Earl Johns (5 February 1893{{spaced ndash}}21 June 1968) was an English First World War Aviator pilot, and writer of adventure stories, usually written under the pen name Captain W. E. Johns. He was the creator of the fictional air-adventurer Biggles.

==Early life==
Johns was born in Bengeo, Hertford, England, the son of Richard Eastman Johns, a fabric tailor, and Elizabeth Johns (Married and maiden names née Earl), the daughter of a master butcher. A younger brother, Russell Ernest Johns, was born on 24 October 1895. Johns early ambition was to be a soldier, and he was a crack shot with a rifle. From January 1905, he attended Richard Hale School Hertford Grammar School.<ref name=johns>{{cite web   url=http://www.wejohns.com/Biography/Biography1/   title=A Brief Biography of Captain W. E. Johns  Part One   website=Wejohns.com   accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref> He also attended evening classes at the local art school.

Johns was not a natural scholar. He included some of his experiences at this school in his book Biggles Goes to School (1951). In the summer of 1907 he was Apprenticeship apprenticed to a county municipal Surveying surveyor for four years and in 1912 was appointed as a sanitary inspector in Swaffham in Norfolk. Soon afterwards, his father died of tuberculosis at the age of 47. On 6 October 1914 Johns married Maude Penelope Hunt (1882–1961), the daughter of the Rev. John Hunt, vicar of Little Dunham, Norfolk.<ref name=johns/> Their only son, William Earl Carmichael Johns, was born in March 1916.

==Military career and the First World War ==
In 1913, while living in Swaffham, and working as a sanitary inspector, Johns enlisted in the Territorial Army (United Kingdom) Territorial Army as a Trooper (rank) trooper in the Norfolk Yeomanry Kings Own Royal Regiment (Norfolk Yeomanry).  The regiment was mobilised in August 1914 and was sent overseas in September 1915, embarking on RMS Olympic RMS Olympic.  The Norfolk Yeomanry fought (as infantry) at Battle of Gallipoli Gallipoli until December when they were withdrawn to Egypt.  In September 1916 Johns transferred to the Machine Gun Corps. While serving on the Macedonian front (World War I) Macedonian front in Greece he was hospitalised with malaria.  After recovering, he was commissioned into the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in September 1917 as a temporary second lieutenant<ref name="LG 19 October 1917">{{London Gazette  issue=30347  date=19 October 1917  page=10886 }}</ref>  and posted back to England for flight training.

Johns undertook his initial flying training at the short-lived airfield at Coley Park in Reading, Berkshire Reading, flying the Farman MF.11 Farman MF.11 Shorthorn aircraft. He was then posted to No.25 Flying Training School at Thetford in Norfolk, closer to where his wife Maude and son Jack were living.<ref name=cpabac>{{cite web   title = The Coley Park Aerodrome and CWS Jam Works   url = http://www.users.on.net/~kevros/coleypark/oc_aerocws.htm   publisher = Coley Park & Beyond (Kevin Rosier) website=Users.on.net   accessdate =15 February 2008}}</ref>
 
On 1 April 1918, Johns was appointed flying instructor at Marske-by-the-Sea in Cleveland, England Cleveland. The aircraft of the time were very unreliable and he wrote off three planes in three days through engine failure – crashing into the sea, then the sand, and then through a fellow officers back door. Later, he was caught in fog over the Tees, missed Hartlepool and narrowly escaped flying into a cliff. Shooting ones own propeller off with a forward-mounted machine-gun with malfunctioning synchronization gear synchronisation was a fairly common accident, and it happened to Johns twice. The Commanding Officer at Marske was a Major Champion, known as Gimlet, a name used later by Johns for the hero of a series of stories. During this time Johnss probationary commission was confirmed<ref>{{London Gazette  issue=30887  date=6 September 1918  page=10551}}</ref> and he served as a flying instructor until August 1918 when he transferred to the Western Front (World War I) Western Front.

He performed six weeks of active duty as a bomber pilot with No. 55 Squadron RAF, close to the average in the latter part of the war.<ref>H.A.Jones. War in the Air. Naval and Military Press; New edition (8 Oct 2002)</ref> This squadron was part of the Independent Air Force, a section of the Royal Air Force that had been formed for the purpose of bombing strategic targets deep inside Germany.

On 16 September 1918 he was piloting one of six De Havilland DH4s on their way to bomb Mannheim when his aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire and he was forced to drop out of formation. He jettisoned his single {{convert 250 lb kg adj=on}} bomb and turned for home, but was attacked by a number of Fokker D.VII fighters. During a lengthy but one-sided battle, Johns observer and rear-gunner, Second Lieutenant Alfred Edward Amey, was badly wounded and the aircraft shot down. The victory was credited to Georg Weiner, the commander of Jagdstaffel 3.<ref name="Hart" /> Johns and Amey were taken prisoner by German troops: Johns received a leg wound during the battle and was slightly injured in the crash, but Amey died of his injuries later that day.<ref name="Hart">{{cite book   title=Aces Falling: War Above The Trenches, 1918   publisher=W&N   author=Hart, Peter   year=2007   page=278   isbn=0297846531}}</ref><ref name="auction">{{cite web   url=http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/medals-royal-flying-corps-biggles-observer-s-casu-1-c-h46sfkylnv   title=Bosleys 2005, Lot 556   website=Invaluable.com   accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref> Johns was a prisoner of war until the end of the war (November 1918).<ref group="Note">Ameys medals were sold at auction in the United Kingdom in 2005, in a lot that included a letter to his family from Johns, describing the circumstances of his death (see: Bosleys 2005, Lot 556). In the preface of Biggles Pioneer Air Fighter (1954), Jones noted that this had been Ameys very first sortie, and he hadnt even had time to unpack his things after arriving at the squadrons base.</ref>

After the war, Johns remained in the Royal Air Force, apparently with the substantive rank of Pilot Officer.<ref group="Note">It was common for officers continuing in the service after the war to take a lower rank than that held during the conflict, but it does seem highly unlikely he had ever held the rank of "Captain" in the RFC (equivalent to Flight Lieutenant in the RAF), even on an "acting" basis.</ref> His promotion to the rank of Flying Officer was gazetted on 23 November 1920.<ref name="LG 30 November 1920">{{London Gazette  issue=32145  date=30 November 1920  page=11823 }}</ref> Johns worked in central London as a recruiting officer<ref name=johns2>{{cite web   url=http://www.wejohns.com/Biography/Biography2/   title=A Brief Biography of Captain W.

Lawrence (of Arabia) as an RAF recruit for obviously giving a false name, but was later ordered to accept him.<ref>Biography of Johns, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</ref>

By 1923, Johns had left his wife. His RAF commission had been extended a further four years and he had moved to Birmingham, again working as a recruitment officer. In Birmingham  he met Doris Dol May Leigh<ref name=johns2 /> (1900–1969), daughter of Alfred Broughton Leigh. They later moved to Newcastle upon Tyne when Johns was posted there. Although he never divorced Maude Hunt, Doris Leigh was known as Mrs Johns until her death. Johns continued to pay for his wife and sons upkeep and for her nursing care (she suffered from acute arthritis).<ref name=johns2 />

W. E. Johns was a prolific author and editor. In his 46-year writing career (1922–68) he penned over 160 books, including nearly one hundred Biggles books, more than sixty other novels and factual books, and scores of magazine articles and short stories.

His first novel, Mossyface,<ref group="Note">Mossy Face, was a name given by the Allies to Havrincourt Havrincourt Wood, it is mentioned in some of the Biggles stories and in some pilots memoirs of the period.</ref> was published in 1922 under the pen name "William Earle". After leaving the RAF, Johns became a newspaper air correspondent, as well as editing and illustrating books about flying. At the request of John Hamilton Ltd, he created the magazine Popular Flying which first appeared in March 1932. It was in the pages of Popular Flying that Biggles first appeared.

The first Biggles book, The Camels are Coming,<ref group="Note">The Sopwith Camel aeroplane, not the animal</ref> was published in August 1932 and Johns would continue to write Biggles stories until his death in 1968. At first, the Biggles stories were credited to "William Earle", but later Johns adopted the more familiar "Capt. W. E. Johns". While his apparent final RAF rank of flying officer was equivalent to an army (or RFC) lieutenant, captain is commonly used for the commander of a vessel or aircraft.<ref group="Note">Nonetheless, in a pen name Johns was entitled to any rank he might have chosen!</ref>

Johns was also a regular contributor to Modern Boy magazine in the late 1930s as well as editing (and writing for) both Popular Flying and Flying (magazine) Flying. From the early 1930s Johns called for the training of more pilots, for if there were not enough when war came, "training would have to be rushed, and under-trained airmen would die in accidents or in combat against better trained German pilots."<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/biggles-flies-uncensored-more-whisky-less-jingoism-8944480.html Patrick Cockburn, "Biggles flies uncensored: more whisky, less jingoism." The Independent, Sunday 17 November 2013] Retrieved 23 November 2013.</ref>  He was removed as editor at the beginning of 1939, probably as a direct result of a scathing editorial, strongly opposed to the policy of Appeasement of Hitler appeasement and highly critical of several Conservative Party (UK)#1920-1963 Conservative statesmen of the time.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.popularflying.com/Covers/81/  title=POPULAR FLYING MAGAZINE – ISSUE 1 (0F 88)  website=Popularflying.com  date=  accessdate=2016-11-19}}</ref> Cockburn, however, feels that the government was concerned about being so "expertly attacked" on the lack of trained pilots by the editor of the most widely read aviation magazines in the world, including readers "in the RAF or connected with flying."<ref>Cockburn 2013.</ref>

Johns opposition to appeasement is reflected in some of his books. For example, in The Black Peril (1935) the storyline revolves around German preparations for conquest. Even more advanced in his thinking, for that time, was the story Biggles Air Commodore (1937) which alludes to Japanese preparations for conquest of British colonies in the Far East.

Apart from "Biggles", his other multi-volume fiction series were:

* The 6-volume "Steeley" series (1936–1939), featuring former First World War pilot turned crime-fighter Deeley Montfort Delaroy (nicknamed "Steeley").
* The 11-volume "Worrals" series (1941–1950), detailing the exploits of plucky WAAF Flight Officer Joan "Worrals" Worralson (who was also the subject of three short stories); these were created at the request of the Air Ministry to inspire young women to join the Womens Auxiliary Air Force.
* The 10-volume "Gimlet" series (1943–1954), whose hero is the dashing British commando Captain Lorrington "Gimlet" King.
* A 10-volume science fiction series (1954–1963) that follows the interplanetary adventures of retired RAF Group Captain Timothy Tiger Clinton, his son Rex, scientist Professor Lucius Brane (who invents a spaceship powered by cosmic rays) and Branes resourceful butler Judkins.

Johns also wrote eight other books of juvenile fiction, twelve books of fiction for adults, and eight factual books, including several books on aviation, books on pirates and treasure hunting, and a book on gardening, The Passing Show.

Unusually among childrens writers of the time, from 1935 Johns employed a working-class character as an equal member of the Biggles team – "Ginger" Habblethwaite, later Hebblethwaite, the son of a Northumberland miner. However, readers never learn his real Christian name, and he proclaims himself a Yorkshireman once or twice.

==Death==
W. E. Johns died on 21 June 1968 in his 76th year. Shortly before his death he was writing the final Biggles story, entitled Biggles does some Homework, which shows Biggles at last preparing to retire, and meeting his Multiracial mixed-race replacement. The twelve chapters written were issued privately in 1997.<ref name = Homework>{{cite web   url = http://www.biggles.info/Details/97/   title = Biggles does some homework – plot summary  website=Biggles.info  accessdate = 2010-02-03   date = 2006-07-26   last = Harris   first = R }}</ref>
