A younger brother, Russell Ernest Johns, was born on 24 October 1895. Johns early ambition was to be a soldier, and he was a crack shot with a rifle. From January 1905, he attended Richard Hale School Hertford Grammar School.
He also attended evening classes at the local art school.

Johns was not a natural scholar. He included some of his experiences at this school in his book Biggles Goes to School (1951).
