Hans-Ulrich Rudel (2 July 1916&nbsp;– 18 December 1982) was a German ground-attack pilot during World War II. Post-war, he was a prominent neo-Nazi activist in Latin America and West Germany.

During the war, Rudel was credited with the destruction of 519 tanks, as well as a number of ships. He claimed 651 aerial victories and the destruction of more than 800 vehicles of all types. He flew 2,530 ground-attack missions exclusively on the Eastern Front (World War II) Eastern Front, usually flying the Junkers Ju 87 "Stuka" dive bomber, and 430 missions flying fighter aircraft. Rudel was the most decorated German serviceman of World War II receiving the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds in January 1945; the decoration was created specifically for him. Rudel surrendered to US forces on 8 May 1945.

Rudel fled to Argentina in 1948. A committed and unrepentant Nazi, he founded the "Kameradenwerk", a relief organization for Nazi war criminals Nazi criminals that helped fugitives escape to Latin America and the Middle East. Together with Willem Sassen, Rudel helped shelter Josef Mengele, the notorious former SS doctor at Auschwitz concentration camp Auschwitz. He worked as an arms dealer and a military advisor to the regimes of Juan Perón in Argentina, of Augusto Pinochet in Chile, and of Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay. Due to these activities, he was placed under observation by the US Central Intelligence Agency.

In the West German federal election, 1953 West German federal election of 1953, Rudel, who had returned to West Germany, was the top candidate for the far-right German Reich Party but was not elected to the Bundestag. Following the Revolución Libertadora in 1955, the uprising that ended the second presidential term of Perón, Rudel moved to Paraguay, where he acted as a foreign representative for several German companies. In 1977, he became a spokesman for the German Peoples Union, a neo-Nazi political party founded by the extremist politician Gerhard Frey (politician) Gerhard Frey.

===In South America===
After Rudel moved to Argentina, he became a close friend and confidant of the President of Argentina Juan Perón, and Paraguays dictator Alfredo Stroessner. In Argentina, he founded the "Kameradenwerk" (literal translation lit. "comrades work" or "comrades act"), a relief organization for Nazi war criminals. Prominent members of the "Kameradenwerk" included Schutzstaffel SS officer Ludwig Lienhardt, whose extradition from Sweden had been demanded by the Soviet Union on war crime charges,{{sfn Goñi 2003 p=130}} Kurt Christmann, a member of the Gestapo sentenced to 10 years for war crimes committed at Krasnodar, Austrian war criminal Fridolin Guth, and the German spy in Chile, August Siebrecht. The group maintained close contact with other internationally wanted fascists, such as Ante Pavelić, Carlo Scorza and Konstantin von Neurath. In addition to these war criminals that fled to Argentina, the "Kameradenwerk" also assisted Nazi criminals imprisoned in Europe, including Rudolf Hess and Karl Dönitz, with food parcels from Argentina and sometimes by paying their legal fees.{{sfn Goñi 2003 p=134}} In Argentina, Rudel became acquainted with notorious Nazi concentration camp doctor and war criminal Josef Mengele.{{sfn Astor 1986 p=170}} Rudel, together with Willem Sassen, a former Waffen-SS and  war correspondent for the Wehrmacht, who initially worked as Rudels driver,{{sfn Benz 2013 p=160}} helped to relocate Mengele to Brazil by introducing him to Nazi supporter Wolfgang Gerhard.{{sfn Levy 2006 p=273}}{{sfn Posner Ware 1986 p=162}} In 1957, Rudel and Mengele together travelled to Chile to meet with Walter Rauff, the inventor of the mobile gas chamber.{{sfn Goñi 2003 p=290}}

In Argentina, Rudel lived in Villa Carlos Paz, roughly {{convert 36 km 0 sp=us}} from the populous Córdoba, Argentina Córdoba City, where he rented a house and operated a brickworks.{{sfn Der Spiegel Volume 51/1950}} There, Rudel wrote his wartime memoirs Trotzdem ("Nevertheless" or "In Spite of Everything").{{sfn Just 1986 p=237}} The book was published in November 1949 by the Dürer-Verlag in Buenos Aires. Dürer-Verlag (1947–1958) issued a variety of apologia by former Nazis and their collaborators. Besides Rudel, among the early editors are Wilfred von Oven, the personal Press adjutant of Goebbels, and Naumann. Sassen convinced Adolf Eichmann to share his view on the Holocaust. Together with Eberhard Fritsch, a former Hitler Youth leader, Sassen began interviewing Eichmann in 1956 with the intent of publishing his views.{{sfn Benz 2013 p=160}} The Dürer-Verlag went bankrupt in 1958.{{sfn Benz 2013 p=161}}

Discussion ensued in Germany on Rudel being allowed to publish the book, because he was a known Nazi. In the book, he supported Nazi policies. This book was later re-edited and published in the United States, as the Cold War intensified, under the title, Stuka Pilot, which supported the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Pierre Clostermann, a French fighter pilot, had befriended Rudel and wrote the foreword to the French edition of his book Stuka Pilot.{{sfn Just 1986 p=272}} In 1951, he published a pamphlet Dolchstoß oder Legende? ("Stab in the Back or Legend?"), in which he claimed that "Germanys war against the Soviet Union was a defensive war", moreover, "a crusade for the whole world".{{sfn Der Spiegel Volume 52/1982}} In the 1950s, Rudel befriended Savitri Devi, a writer and proponent of Hinduism and Nazism, and introduced her to a number of Nazi fugitives in Spain and the Middle East.{{sfn Goodrick-Clarke 2002 pp=102–103}}

With the help of Perón, Rudel secured lucrative contracts with the Brazilian military. He was also active as a military adviser and arms dealer for the Bolivian regime, Augusto Pinochet in Chile and Stroessner in Paraguay.{{sfn Goñi 2003 p=288}} He was in contact with Werner Naumann, formerly a State Secretary in Goebbels Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in Nazi Germany. Following the Revolución Libertadora in 1955, a military and civilian uprising that ended the second presidential term of Perón, Rudel was forced to leave Argentina and move to Paraguay. During the following years in South America, Rudel frequently acted as a foreign representative for several German companies, including Salzgitter AG, Dornier Flugzeugwerke, Focke-Wulf, Messerschmitt, Siemens and Lahmeyer International, a German consulting engineering firm.{{sfn Wulffen 2010 p=139}} Rudels input was used during the development of the A-10 Thunderbolt II, a United States Air Force aircraft designed solely for close air support, including attacking ground targets as tanks and armoured fighting vehicle armored vehicles.{{sfn Coram 2004 p=235}}

According to the historian Peter Hammerschmidt, based on files of the German Federal Intelligence Service (Germany) Federal Intelligence Service and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the BND, under the cover-up company "Merex", was in close contact with former SS and Nazi Party members. In 1966, Merex, represented by Walter Drück, a former Generalmajor in the Wehrmacht and BND agent, helped by the contacts established by Rudel and Sassen, sold discarded equipment of the Bundeswehr (German Federal armed forces) to various dictators in Latin America. According to Hammerschmidt, Rudel assisted in establishing contact between Merex and Friedrich Schwend, a former member of the Reich Main Security Office and involved in Operation Bernhard. Schwend, according to Hammerschmidt, had close links with the military services of Peru and Bolivia. In the early sixties, Rudel, Schwend and Klaus Barbie, founded a company called "La Estrella", the star, which employed a number of former SS officers who had fled to Latin America.{{sfn Hammerschmidt 2014 pp=254–257}}{{sfn Gessler 2011}} Rudel, through La Estrella, was also in contact with Otto Skorzeny, who had his own network of former SS and Wehrmacht officers.{{sfn Hammerschmidt 2014 p=257}}

Rudel returned to West Germany in 1953 and became a leading member of the Neo-Nazi nationalist political party, the German Reich Party (Deutsche Reichspartei or DRP).{{sfn Hamilton 1996 p=426}} In the West German federal election, 1953 West German federal election of 1953, Rudel was the top candidate for the DRP, but was not elected to the Bundestag.{{sfn Federal Election 1953}} According to :de:Josef Müller-Marein Josef Müller-Marein, editor-in-chief of Die Zeit, Rudel had an egocentric character. In his political speeches, Rudel made generalizing statements, claiming that he was speaking on behalf of most, if not all, former German soldiers of World War II. Rudel heavily criticized the Allies of World War II Western Allies during World War II for not having supported Germany in its war against the Soviet Union. Rudels political demeanor subsequently alienated him from his former comrades, foremost Gadermann. Müller-Marein concluded his article with the statement: "Rudel no longer has a Geschwader!"{{sfn Müller-Marein 1953 pp=1–3}} In 1977, he became a spokesman for the German Peoples Union, a nationalist political party founded by Gerhard Frey (politician) Gerhard Frey.{{sfn Der Tagesspiegel—Visit}}

===Public scandals===
In October 1976, Rudel inadvertently triggered a chain of events, which were later dubbed the Rudel Scandal Rudel-Affäre (Rudel Scandal). Aufklärungsgeschwader 51 Aufklärungsgeschwader 51 (51st Reconnaissance Wing), the latest unit to hold the name "Immelmann", held a reunion for members of the unit, including those from World War II. The Secretary of State in the Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany) Federal Ministry of Defence, :de:Hermann Schmidt (Politiker, 1917) Hermann Schmidt authorized the event. Fearing that Rudel would spread Nazi propaganda on the German Air Force airbase in Hartheim am Rhein Bremgarten near Freiburg, Schmidt ordered that the meeting could not be held at the airbase. News of this decision reached Generalleutnant Walter Krupinski, at the time commanding general of NATOs Second Allied Tactical Air Force, and a former World War II fighter pilot. Krupinski contacted Gerhard Limberg, Inspector of the Air Force, requesting that the meeting be allowed to be held at the airbase. Limberg later confirmed Krupinskis request, and the meeting was held on Bundeswehr premises, a decision to which Schmidt still had not agreed. Rudel attended the meeting, at which he signed his book and gave a few autographs but refrained from making any political statements.{{sfn Die ZEIT Volume 46/1976}}

During a routine press event, journalists, who had been briefed by Schmidt, questioned Krupinski and his deputy Karl Heinz Franke about Rudels presence. In this interview, the generals compared Rudels past as a Nazi and Neo-Nazi supporter to the career of prominent Social Democrat leader Herbert Wehner, who had been a member of the German Communist Party in the 1930s, and who had lived in Moscow during World War II, where he was allegedly involved in NKVD operations. Calling Wehner an extremist, they described Rudel as an honorable man, who "hadnt stolen the family silver or anything else". When these remarks became public, the Federal Minister of Defense Georg Leber, complying with §50 of the {{illm Soldatengesetz de Soldatengesetz}} (Military law), ordered the generals into early retirement as of 1 November 1976. Leber,  a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), was heavily criticized for his actions by the Christian Democratic Union (Germany) Christian Democratic Union (CDU) opposition, and the scandal contributed to the ministers subsequent retirement in early 1978.{{sfn Die ZEIT Volume 46/1976}} On 3 February 1977, the German Bundestag debated the scandal and its consequences. The Rudel Scandal subsequently triggered a military-tradition discussion, which the Federal Minister of Defense Hans Apel ended with the introduction of "Guidelines for Understanding and Cultivating Tradition" on 20 September 1982.{{sfn The Rudel-Scandal}}

During the 1978 FIFA World Cup, held in Argentina, Rudel visited the German national football team in their training camp in Ascochinga. The German media criticized the German Football Association, and viewed Rudels visit as being sympathetic to the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina following the 1976 Argentine coup détat. During the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden, he visited the German team at Malmö on 8 June 1958. There he was welcomed by team manager Sepp Herberger.{{sfn Just 1986 p=270}}

===Personal life, death and funeral===
File:Rudelgrabstätte.jpg thumb upright Rudels grave in Dornhausen
Rudel was married three times. His 1942 marriage to Ursula, nicknamed "Hanne", produced two sons, Hans-Ulrich and Siegfried. They divorced in 1950. According to the news magazine Der Spiegel, one reason for the divorce was that his wife had sold some of his decorations, including the Oak Leaves with Diamonds, to an American collector, but she also refused to move to Argentina.{{sfn Der Spiegel Volume 48/1950}} On 27 March 1951, Der Spiegel published Ursula Rudels denial of selling his decorations, and further stated she had no intention of doing so.{{sfn Der Spiegel Volume 13/1951}} Rudel married his second wife, Ursula née Daemisch in 1965. The marriage produced his third son, Christoph, born in 1969.{{sfn Neitzel, Sönke 2005 p=160}} A year later, Rudel survived a stroke on 26 April 1970.{{sfn Just 1986 p=37}} Following his divorce in 1977, he married Ursula née Bassfeld.{{sfn Neitzel, Sönke 2005 p=160}}

Rudel died after suffering another stroke in Rosenheim on 18 December 1982,{{sfn Der Spiegel Volume 52/1982}} and was buried in Theilenhofen Dornhausen on 22 December 1982. During Rudels burial ceremony, two Bundeswehr McDonnell F-4 F-4 Phantoms appeared to make a low altitude flypast over his grave. Although Dornhausen was situated in the middle of a flightpath regularly flown by military aircraft, Bundeswehr officers denied deliberately flying aircraft over the funeral. Four mourners were photographed giving Nazi salutes at the funeral, and were investigated under Strafgesetzbuch section 86a a law banning the display of Nazi symbols. The Federal Minister of Defence Manfred Wörner declared that the flight of the aircraft had been a normal training exercise.{{sfn Der Spiegel Volume 1/1983}}

==Summary of military career==
