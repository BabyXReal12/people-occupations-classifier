"I didnt really want to get involved in the war", Kerry said in a book of Vietnam reminiscences published in 1986. "When I signed up for the swift boats, they had very little to do with the war.

===Military honors===
During the night of December 2 and early morning of December 3, 1968, Kerry was in charge of a small boat operating near a peninsula north of Cam Ranh Bay together with a Swift boat (PCF-60). According to Kerry and the two crewmen who accompanied him that night, Patrick Runyon and William Zaladonis, they surprised a group of Vietnamese men unloading sampans at a river crossing, who began running and failed to obey an order to stop. As the men fled, Kerry and his crew opened fire on the sampans and destroyed them, then rapidly left. During this encounter, Kerry received a shrapnel wound in the left arm above the elbow. It was for this injury that Kerry received his first Purple Heart Purple Heart Medal.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/04/17/kerry_purple/index.html  publisher=Salon  title=John Kerrys first Purple Heart  first=Douglas  last=Brinkley  accessdate=January 3, 2007  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/658F4pZWb?url=http://www.salon.com/2004/04/17/kerry_purple/  archivedate=February 1, 2012  df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Kerry received his second Purple Heart for a wound received in action on the Bồ Đề River on February 20, 1969. The plan had been for the Swift boats to be accompanied by support helicopters. On the way up the Bo De, however, the helicopters were attacked. As the Swift boats reached the Cửa Lớn River, Kerrys boat was hit by a RPG-2 B-40 rocket (rocket propelled grenade round), and a piece of shrapnel shell shrapnel hit Kerrys left leg, wounding him. Thereafter, enemy fire ceased and his boat reached the Gulf of Thailand safely. Kerry continues to have shrapnel embedded in his left thigh because the doctors that first treated him decided to remove the damaged tissue and close the wound with surgical suture sutures rather than make a wide opening to remove the shrapnel.<ref name="Rasmussen1">{{cite web url=http://kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/Doyle.pdf title=Primary Sources: John Kerrys Vietnam Medals first=Eric last=Rasmussen year=2004 work=Truth and Unfit for Command A Review publisher=kerryvietnam.org accessdate=September 5, 2013 format=PDF}}</ref> Though wounded like several others earlier that day, Kerry did not lose any time off from duty.<ref name="Rasmussen2">{{cite web url=http://kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/SeaLords324.pdf title=Primary Sources: John Kerrys Vietnam Medals first=Eric last=Rasmussen year=2004 work=Truth and Unfit for Command A Review publisher=kerryvietnam.org accessdate=September 5, 2013 format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="Rasmussen3">{{cite web url=http://www.kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/SeaLords312-316.pdf title=Part I: John Kerry in Vietnam first=Eric last=Rasmussen year=2004 work=Truth and Unfit for Command A Review publisher=kerryvietnam.org accessdate=September 5, 2013 format=PDF}}</ref>

====Silver Star====
Eight days later, on February 28, 1969, came the events for which Kerry was awarded his Silver Star Medal. On this occasion, Kerry was in tactical command of his Swift boat and two other Swift boats during a combat operation. Their mission on the Duong Keo River included bringing an underwater demolition team and dozens of South Vietnamese Marines to destroy enemy sampans, structures and bunkers as described in the story The Death Of PCF 43.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.mwweb.com/ndc/SwiftBoats/pcf43.htm  title=LTJG Peter N.

Moving a short distance upstream, Kerrys boat was the target of a B-40 rocket round; Kerry charged the enemy positions and as his boat Heaving to hove to and Beaching (nautical) beached, a Viet Cong ("VC") insurgent armed with a rocket launcher emerged from a spider hole and ran. While the boats gunner opened fire, wounding the VC in the leg, and while the other boats approached and offered cover fire, Kerry jumped from the boat to pursue the VC insurgent, subsequently killing him and capturing his loaded rocket launcher.<ref>{{cite web url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/jksilverstar.pdf  title=Silver Star Medal – John F.

Kerrys commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander George Elliott, stated to Douglas Brinkley in 2003 that he did not know whether to court-martial Kerry for beaching the boat without orders or give him a medal for saving the crew. Elliott recommended Kerry for the Silver Star, and Zumwalt flew into An Thoi to personally award medals to Kerry and the rest of the sailors involved in the mission. The Navys account of Kerrys actions is presented in the original s:Silver Star Citation - John Kerry medal citation signed by Zumwalt.

====Bronze Star====
On March 13, 1969, on the Bái Háp River, Kerry was in charge of one of five Swift boats that were returning to their base after performing an Operation Sealords mission to transport South Vietnamese troops from the garrison at Cái Nước and MIKE Force advisors for a raid on a Vietcong camp located on the Rach Dong Cung canal. Earlier in the day, Kerry received a slight shrapnel wound in the buttocks from blowing up a rice bunker. Debarking some but not all of the passengers at a small village, the boats approached a fishing weir; one group of boats went around to the left of the weir, hugging the shore, and a group with Kerrys PCF-94 boat went around to the right, along the shoreline. A mine was detonated directly beneath the lead boat, PCF-3, as it crossed the weir to the left, lifting PCF-3 "about 2-3 ft out of water".<ref name=Rasmussen7>{{cite web url=http://kerryvietnam.org/PDFs/SeaLords358.pdf title=Primary Sources: John Kerrys Vietnam Medals first=Eric last=Rasmussen year=2004 work=Truth and Unfit for Command A Review publisher=kerryvietnam.org accessdate=September 5, 2013 format=PDF}}</ref>

James Rassmann, a United States Army Special Forces Green Beret advisor who was aboard Kerrys PCF-94, was knocked overboard when, according to witnesses and the documentation of the event, a mine or rocket exploded close to the boat. According to the documentation for the event, Kerrys arm was injured when he was thrown against a bulkhead during the explosion. PCF 94 returned to the scene and Kerry rescued Rassmann who was receiving sniper fire from the water. Kerry received the Bronze Star Medal with Combat "V" for "heroic achievement", for his actions during this incident; he also received his third Purple Heart.<ref>{{cite web url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/jkerry/jkbronzestar.pdf  title=Bronze Star Medal – John F.

===Controversy===
{{Main John Kerry military service controversy}}
With the continuing George W. Bush military service controversy controversy that had surrounded the military service of George W. Bush since the United States presidential election, 2000 2000 Presidential election (when he was accused of having used his fathers political influence to gain entrance to the Texas Air National Guard, thereby protecting himself from conscription into the United States Army, and possible service in the Vietnam War), John Kerrys contrasting status as a decorated Vietnam War veteran posed a problem for Bushs re-election campaign, which Republicans sought to counter by calling Kerrys war record into question. As the presidential campaign of 2004 developed, approximately 250 members of a group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT, later renamed Swift Vets and POWs for Truth) opposed Kerrys campaign. The group held press conferences, ran ads and endorsed a book questioning Kerrys service record and his military awards.

After returning to the United States, Kerry joined the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW).<ref name=Fire>{{cite book   last1=ODonnell  first1=Lawrence  date=2017  title="Playing with Fire – The 1968 Elections and the Transformation of American Politics”  edition=1st  publisher=Penguin Press  page=6  isbn=9780399563140}}</ref> Then numbering about 20,000,<ref>{{cite news  first=Jerry  last=Lembcke  title=Still a Force for Peace  url=http://www.vvaw.org/veteran/article/?id=378  date=Fall 2003}}</ref> VVAW was considered by some (including the administration of President Richard Nixon) to be an effective, if controversial, component of the antiwar movement.<ref>{{cite news  first=Brian  last=Williams  authorlink=Brian Williams  title=Nixon targeted Kerry for anti-war views  url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4534274/}}</ref> Kerry participated in the "Winter Soldier Investigation" conducted by VVAW of U.S. atrocities in Vietnam, and he appears in a film by that name that documents the investigation.<ref>The Washington Post, December 9, 2005, "Winter Soldier: Cold Days in Hell," https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/08/AR2005120801996.html</ref> According to Nixon Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, "I didnt approve of what he did, but I understood the protesters quite well", and he declined two requests from the Navy to court martial Reserve Lieutenant Kerry over his antiwar activity.<ref>{{cite news  title=Roots of John Kerry’s secretary of state ambition lie in wake of 2004 defeat  author=  first=Tracy  last=Jan  author2=Bryan Bender  url=http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/12/21/roots-john-kerry-secretary-state-ambition-lie-wake-defeat/qE3obS65phxPdk6qlOdjGP/story.html  newspaper=The Boston Globe  date=December 21, 2012  accessdate=January 12, 2013 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230190821/www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/12/21/roots-john-kerry-secretary-state-ambition-lie-wake-defeat/qE3obS65phxPdk6qlOdjGP/story.html archivedate=December 30, 2012  quote=Just three months after losing his campaign to be president}}</ref>

On April 22, 1971, Kerry appeared before a U.S. Senate committee hearing on proposals relating to ending the war. The day after this testimony, Kerry participated in a demonstration with thousands of other veterans in which he and other Vietnam War veterans threw their medals and service ribbons over a fence erected at the front steps of the United States Capitol building to dramatize their opposition to the war. Jack Smith, a United States Marine Corps Marine, read a statement explaining why the veterans were returning their military awards to the government. For more than two hours, almost 1000 angry veterans tossed their medals, ribbons, hats, jackets, and military papers over the fence. Each veteran gave his or her name, hometown, branch of service and a statement. Kerry threw some of his own decorations and awards as well as some given to him by other veterans to throw. As Kerry threw his decorations over the fence, his statement was: "Im not doing this for any violent reasons, but for peace and justice, and to try and make this country wake up once and for all."<ref>{{cite news  first=Tom  last=Oliphant  authorlink=Tom Oliphant  title=I watched Kerry throw his war decorations  url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/04/27/i_watched_kerry_throw_his_war_decorations/   work=The Boston Globe   date=April 27, 2004}}</ref>

Kerry was arrested on May 30, 1971, during a VVAW march to honor American prisoner of war POWs held captive by North Vietnam. The march was planned as a multi-day event from Concord, Massachusetts Concord to Boston, and while in Lexington, Massachusetts Lexington, participants tried to camp on the village green. At 2:30&nbsp;a.m., local and state police arrested 441 demonstrators, including Kerry, for trespassing. All were given the Miranda Warning and were hauled away on school buses to spend the night at the Lexington Public Works Garage. Kerry and the other protesters later paid a $5 fine, and were released. The mass arrests caused a community backlash and ended up giving positive coverage to the VVAW.<ref>Unfinished Symphony: Democracy and Dissent – Documentary, 2001.</ref><ref>Against the Vietnam War: Writings by Activists, Mary Susannah Robbins, pp. 78–90.</ref><ref>Lexington Minute-Man Newspaper, May 23, 1991.</ref>

==Early political career (1972–1985)==

===1972 congressional election===
In 1970, Kerry had considered running for Congress in the Democratic primary against hawkish Democrat Philip J. Philbin of Massachusettss 3rd congressional district, but deferred in favor of Robert Drinan, a Jesuit priest and anti-war activist, who went on to defeat Philbin.<ref name="citm-pt4">{{cite news  first=Brian C. last=Mooney  title=First campaign ends in defeat  url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061803.shtml  work=The Boston Globe  date=June 18, 2003  accessdate=April 9, 2016 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031002060303/http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/061803.shtml archivedate=October 2, 2003}}</ref> In February 1972, Kerrys wife bought a house in Worcester, Massachusetts Worcester, with Kerry intending to run against the Massachusettss 4th congressional district 4th districts aging thirteen-term incumbent Democrat, Harold Donohue.<ref name="citm-pt4"/> The couple never moved in. After Republican Congressman F. Bradford Morse of the neighboring Massachusettss 5th congressional district 5th district announced his retirement and then resignation to become Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs at the United Nations, the couple instead rented an apartment in Lowell, Massachusetts Lowell, so that Kerry could run to succeed him.<ref name="citm-pt4"/>

Including Kerry, the Democratic primary race had 10 candidates, including attorney Paul J. Sheehy, State Representative Anthony R. DiFruscia, John J. Desmond and Robert B. Kennedy. Kerry ran a "very expensive, sophisticated campaign", financed by out-of-state backers and supported by many young volunteers.<ref name="citm-pt4"/> DiFruscias campaign headquarters shared the same building as Kerrys. On the eve of the September 19 primary, police found Kerrys younger brother Cameron Kerry Cameron and campaign field director Thomas J. Vallely, breaking into where the buildings telephone lines were located. They were arrested and charged with "burglary breaking and entering with the intent to commit grand larceny", but the charges were dropped a year later. At the time of the incident, DiFruscia alleged that the two were trying to disrupt his get-out-the vote efforts. Vallely and Cameron Kerry maintained that they were only checking their own telephone lines because they had received an anonymous call warning that the Kerry lines would be cut.<ref name="citm-pt4"/>

Despite the arrests, Kerry won the primary with 20,771 votes (27.56%). Sheehy came second with 15,641 votes (20.75%), followed by DiFruscia with 12,222 votes (16.22%), Desmond with 10,213 votes (13.55%) and Kennedy with 5,632 votes (7.47%). The remaining 10,891 votes were split amongst the other five candidates, with 1970 nominee Richard Williams coming last with just 1,706 votes (2.26%).<ref name="citm-pt4"/><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=382445 title=MA District 5 - D Primary 1972 publisher=Our Campaigns accessdate=April 9, 2016}}</ref>

In the general election, Kerry was initially favored to defeat the Republican candidate, former State Representative Paul W. Cronin, and conservative Democrat Roger P. Durkin, who ran as an Independent. A week after the primary, one poll put Kerry 26-points ahead of Cronin.<ref name="citm-pt4"/> His campaign called for a national health insurance system, discounted prescription drugs for the unemployed, a jobs program to clean up the Merrimack River and rent controls in Lowell and Lawrence, Massachusetts Lawrence. A major obstacle, however, was the districts leading newspaper, the Conservatism in the United States conservative The Sun (Lowell) The Sun. The paper editorialized against him. It also ran critical news stories about his out-of-state contributions and his "carpetbagger carpetbagging", because he had only moved into the district in April. Subsequently, released "Watergate" Oval Office tape recordings of the Nixon White House showed that defeating Kerrys candidacy had attracted the personal attention of President Nixon.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/24/politics/campaign/echoes-of-a-1972-loss-haunt-a-2004-campaign.html title=Echoes of a 1972 Loss Haunt a 2004 Campaign author=Todd Purdum work=The New York Times date=September 24, 2004 accessdate=April 9, 2016}}</ref> Kerry himself asserts that Nixon sent operatives to Lowell to help derail his campaign.<ref name="citm-pt4"/>

===Iran–Contra hearings===
{{Main Kerry Committee report}}
On April 18, 1985, a few months after taking his Senate seat, Kerry and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa traveled to Nicaragua and met the countrys president, Daniel Ortega. Though Ortega had won internationally certified elections, the trip was criticized because Ortega and his leftist Sandinista government had strong ties to Cuba and the USSR and were accused of human rights abuses. The Sandinista government was opposed by the right-wing Central Intelligence Agency CIA-backed rebels known as the Contra (guerrillas) Contras. While in Nicaragua, Kerry and Harkin talked to people on both sides of the conflict. Through the senators, Ortega offered a cease-fire agreement in exchange for the U.S. dropping support of the Contras. The offer was denounced by the Ronald Reagan Reagan administration as a "propaganda initiative" designed to influence a House vote on a $14 million Contra foreign aid aid package, but Kerry said "I am willing..... to take the risk in the effort to put to test the good faith of the Sandinistas." The House voted down the Contra aid, but Ortega flew to Moscow to accept a $200 million loan the next day, which in part prompted the House to pass a larger $27 million aid package six weeks later.<ref name="citm-pt6">{{cite news  first=John Aloysius  last=Farrell  title=With probes, making his mark  url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/062003.shtml  work=The Boston Globe  date=June 20, 2003 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030621071459/http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/062003.shtml archivedate=June 21, 2003  accessdate=July 7, 2018}}</ref>

Meanwhile, Kerrys staff began their own investigations and, on October 14, issued a report that exposed illegal activities on the part of Lieutenant colonel (United States) Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, who had set up a private network involving the United States National Security Council National Security Council and the CIA to deliver military equipment to right-wing Nicaraguan rebels (Contras). In effect, North and certain members of the Presidents administration were accused by Kerrys report of illegally funding and supplying armed militants without the authorization of Congress.

===George H. W. Bush administration===
On November 15, 1988, at a businessmens breakfast in Lynn, Massachusetts East Lynn, Massachusetts, Kerry made a joke about then-President-elect of the United States President-elect George H. W. Bush and his running mate, saying "if Bush is shot, the United States Secret Service Secret Service has orders to shoot Dan Quayle." He apologized the following day.<ref>{{cite news url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&p_theme=sl&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB32978E9020931&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date  title=Senator repudiates Shoot Quayle joke  publisher= St. Louis Post-Dispatch Archives/AP via Nl.newsbank.com  date=November 17, 1988  accessdate=March 12, 2010}}</ref>

During their investigation of Noriega, Kerrys staff found reason to believe that the Pakistan-based Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) had facilitated Noriegas drug trafficking and money laundering. This led to a separate inquiry into BCCI, and as a result, banking regulators shut down BCCI in 1991. In December 1992, Kerry and Senator Hank Brown, a Republican from Colorado, released The BCCI Affair, a report on the BCCI scandal. The report showed that the bank was crooked and was working with terrorism terrorists, including Abu Nidal. It blasted the U.S. Department of Justice Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of the Treasury Department of the Treasury, the United States Customs Service Customs Service, the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve Bank, as well as influential lobbying lobbyists and the CIA.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0409.sirota.html  title=Follow the Money  last=Sirota  first=David  author2=Baskin, Jonathan  date=September 2004  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040911081424/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0409.sirota.html  archivedate=September 11, 2004  df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Kerry was criticized by some Democrats for having pursued his own party members, including former United States Secretary of Defense Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford, although Republicans said he should have pressed against some Democrats even harder. The BCCI scandal was later turned over to the New York County District Attorney Manhattan District Attorneys office.<ref>{{cite web url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/1992_rpt/bcci/19rogers.htm  title=The BCCI Affair – 19 Ed Rogers and Kamal Adham publisher=Fas.org  date=  accessdate=March 12, 2010}}</ref>

===Precursors to presidential bid===

In 1996, Kerry faced a difficult re-election fight against Governor William Weld, a popular Republican incumbent who had been re-elected in 1994 with 71% of the vote. The race was covered nationwide as one of the most closely watched Senate races that year. Kerry and Weld held several debates and negotiated a campaign spending cap of $6.9 million at Kerrys Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts Beacon Hill townhouse. Both candidates spent more than the cap, with each camp accusing the other of being first to break the agreement.<ref>{{cite news last=Rimer  first=Sara  url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E5D91130F936A15753C1A960958260  title=Promises Yield to Old-Fashioned Politics  publisher=The New York Times  date=October 25, 1996  accessdate=March 12, 2010}}</ref> During the campaign, Kerry spoke briefly at the 1996 Democratic National Convention.

==="You get stuck in Iraq" controversy===
On October 30, 2006, Kerry was a headline speaker at a campaign rally being held for Democratic California gubernatorial election, 2006 California gubernatorial candidate Phil Angelides at Pasadena City College in Pasadena, California. Speaking to an audience composed mainly of college students, Kerry said, "You know, education, if you make the most of it, you study hard, you do your homework and you make an effort to be smart, you can do well.

The day after the remarks were made public, leaders from both sides of the political spectrum criticized Kerrys remarks, which he said were a botched joke. Republicans including President George W. Bush, Senator John McCain and then-Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, said that Kerrys comments were insulting to American military forces fighting in Iraq. Democratic Representative Harold Ford, Jr. called on Kerry to apologize.<ref>{{cite news  last=Runningen first=Roger  url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aSkiYG2_QwvM   title =Kerry Events Cut as Democrats Criticize Iraq Remark    publisher =Bloomberg News  date =November 1, 2006   archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402194319/https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aSkiYG2_QwvM archivedate=April 2, 2015}}</ref>

===Voting record===

====Overall====
Most analyses place Kerrys voting record on the left within the Senate Democratic caucus.<ref>[http://www.factcheck.org/how_liberal_is_john_kerry.html How Liberal is John Kerry?] FactCheck.org. Retrieved January 28, 2013.</ref> During the 2004 presidential election he was portrayed as a staunch Liberalism in the United States liberal by conservative groups and the Bush campaign, who often noted that in 2003 Kerry was rated the National Journals top Senate liberal. However, that rating was based only upon voting on legislation within that past year. In fact, in terms of career voting records, the National Journal found that Kerry is the 11th most liberal member of the Senate. Most analyses find that Kerry is at least slightly more liberal than the typical Democratic Senator. Kerry has stated that he opposes privatizing Social Security (United States) Social Security, supports abortion rights for adult women and minors, supports same-sex marriage, opposes capital punishment except for terrorists, supports most Gun politics in the United States#Gun control laws gun control laws, and is generally a supporter of trade agreements. Kerry supported the North American Free Trade Agreement and Most Favored Nation status for China, but opposed the Central American Free Trade Agreement.{{citation needed date=December 2013}}

In July 1997 Kerry joined his Senate colleagues in voting against ratification of the Kyoto Treaty on global warming without greenhouse gas emissions limits on nations deemed developing, including India and China.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=105&session=1&vote=00205  title=U.S. Senate: Legislation & Records Home > Votes > Roll Call Vote  publisher=Senate.gov  date=  accessdate=March 12, 2010}}</ref> Since then, Kerry has attacked President Bush, charging him with opposition to international efforts to combat global warming.<ref name="pariah">{{cite news  title=Kerry says U.S. a sort of international pariah  url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-01-27-kerry-us-policy_x.htm?csp=34  work=  publisher=USA TODAY  date=January 27, 2007}}</ref>

====Iraq====
In the lead up to the Iraq War, Kerry said on October 9, 2002; "I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security." Bush relied on that resolution in ordering the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Kerry also gave a January 23, 2003 speech to Georgetown University saying "Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator; leading an oppressive regime he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real." Kerry did, however, warn that the administration should exhaust its diplomatic avenues before launching war: "Mr. President, do not rush to war, take the time to build the coalition, because its not winning the war thats hard, its winning the peace thats hard."<ref>{{cite news  title=Kerry Makes It Official  url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/02/politics/main571162.shtml  publisher=CBS  date=September 2, 2003}}</ref>

After the invasion of Iraq, when no weapons of mass destruction were found, Kerry strongly criticized Bush, contending that he had misled the country: "When the President of the United States looks at you and tells you something, there should be some trust."<ref>{{cite news  title=Bush defends Iraq war in face of WMD findings  url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/01/27/sprj.nirq.bush/  publisher=CNN  date=January 28, 2004}}</ref>

In the 2004 Democratic United States presidential primary presidential primaries, John Kerry defeated several Democratic rivals, including Sen. John Edwards (D-North Carolina.), former Vermont Governor Howard Dean and retired United States Army Army General Wesley Clark. His victory in the Iowa caucuses is widely believed to be the tipping point where Kerry revived his sagging campaign in New Hampshire and the February 3, 2004, primary states like Arizona, South Carolina and New Mexico. Kerry then went on to win landslide victories in Nevada and Wisconsin. Kerry thus won the Democratic nomination to run for President of the United States against incumbent George W. Bush. On July 6, 2004, he announced his selection of John Edwards as his running mate. Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, who was Kerrys 2004 campaign adviser, wrote an article in Time (magazine) Time magazine claiming that after the election, Kerry had said that he wished he had never picked Edwards, and that the two have since stopped speaking to each other.<ref>{{cite news last=Shrum  first=Robert  url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1626498-2,00.html  title=Kerrys Regrets About John Edwards  publisher=Time.com  date=May 30, 2007  accessdate=March 12, 2010}}</ref> In a subsequent appearance on ABCs This Week, Kerry refused to respond to Shrums allegation, calling it a "ridiculous waste of time."<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/01/13/kerry-disregards-bob-shru_n_81260.html  title=Kerry Disregards Bob Shrum Book: "Ridiculous Waste Of Time"  publisher=Huffingtonpost.com  date= January 13, 2008 accessdate=March 12, 2010  first=Nico  last=Pitney}}</ref>

During his bid to be elected president in United States presidential election, 2004 2004, Kerry frequently criticized President George W. Bush for starting the Iraq War.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5552784/#.UU4rEpGZwg9 "Text of Kerrys Acceptance Speech,"], NBC News, July 29, 2004. "Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesnt make it so. Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesnt make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesnt make it so."</ref> While Kerry had initially voted in support of authorizing President Bush to use force in dealing with Saddam Hussein, he voted against an $87 billion supplemental appropriations bill to pay for the subsequent war. His statement on March 16, 2004, "I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it," helped the Bush campaign to paint him as a flip-flopper and has been cited as contributing to Kerrys defeat.<ref name="baroneandcohen">{{cite book first=Michael last=Barone first2=Richard E. last2=Cohen  title = The Almanac of American Politics 2010 location=Washington, D.C. publisher=National Journal Group year = 2009 page = 731 isbn = 978-0-89234-120-7 authorlink=Michael Barone (pundit) quote = Bushs job approval hovered under 50%, and he trailed Kerry in polls for much of the seven-month campaign.

On November 3, 2004, Kerry conceded the race. Kerry won 59.03 million votes, or 48.3 percent of the popular vote; Bush won 62.04 million votes, or 50.7 percent of the popular vote. Kerry carried states with a total of 252 United States Electoral College electoral votes. One Kerry elector voted for Kerrys running mate, Edwards, so in the final tally Kerry had 251 electoral votes to Bushs 286.<ref>http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2004/federalelections2004.pdf</ref>

In the State Department, Kerry quickly earned a reputation "for being aloof, keeping to himself, and not bothering to read staff memos." Career State Department officials have complained that power has become too centralized under Kerrys leadership, which slows department operations when Kerry is on one of his frequent overseas trips. Others in State describe Kerry as having "a kind of diplomatic attention deficit disorder" as he shifts from topic to topic instead of focusing on long-term strategy. When asked whether he was traveling too much, he responded, "Hell no. Im not slowing down." Despite Kerrys early achievements, morale at State is lower than under Hillary Clinton according to department employees.<ref>{{cite news last=Rohde first=David date=November 20, 2013 title=How John Kerry Could End Up Outdoing Hillary Clinton url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/12/john-kerry-will-not-be-denied/354688/ newspaper=The Atlantic}}</ref> However, after Kerrys first six months in the State Department, a Gallup poll found he had high approval ratings among Americans as Secretary of State.<ref>{{cite news last=Arkin first=James date=September 16, 2013 title=Poll: John Kerrys approval tops President Obamas url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/john-kerry-approval-rating-poll-96842.html newspaper=Politico}}</ref> After a year, another poll showed Kerrys favorability continued to rise.<ref>{{cite news last=Swift first=Art date=March 5, 2014 title=Secretary of State Kerrys Favorability Rising in the U.S. url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/167741/secretary-state-kerry-favorability-rising.aspx}}</ref> Less than two years into Kerrys term, the Foreign Policy Magazines 2014 Ivory Tower survey of international relations scholars asked, "Who was the most effective U.S. Secretary of State in the past 50 years?"; John Kerry and Lawrence Eagleburger tied for 11th place out of the 15 confirmed Secretaries of State in that period.<ref>{{cite news last=Kamen first=Al date=February 5, 2015 title=Scholars votes put Kerry dead last in terms of effectiveness url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2015/02/05/scholars-rank-kerry-dead-last-in-terms-of-effectiveness/ newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news last=Maliniak first=Daniel date=February 5, 2015 title=The Best International Relations Schools in the World url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/03/top-twenty-five-schools-international-relations/ newspaper=Foreign Policy}}</ref>

In January 2014, having met with Secretary of State, Archbishop Pietro Parolin, Kerry said "We touched on just about every major issue that we are both working on, that are issues of concern to all of us. First of all, we talked at great length about Syria, and I was particularly appreciative for the Archbishops raising this issue, and equally grateful for the Holy Fathers comments – the Popes comments yesterday regarding his support for the Geneva II process. We welcome that support. It is very important to have broad support, and I know that the Pope is particularly concerned about the massive numbers of displaced human beings and the violence that has taken over 130,000 lives".<ref>{{cite web url=http://m.state.gov/md219654.htm title=Remarks After Meeting With Secretary of State of the Holy See Pietro Parolin work=state.gov deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203112534/http://m.state.gov/md219654.htm archivedate=February 3, 2014 df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Syria===
Following the August 21, 2013, Ghouta chemical attack chemical weapons attack on the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus attributed to Syrian government forces, Kerry became a leading advocate for the use of military force against the Syrian government for what he called "a despots brutal and flagrant use of chemical weapons."<ref>{{cite news  date=August 30, 2013  title=Kerry Becomes Chief Advocate for U.S. Attack  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/31/world/middleeast/john-kerry-syria.html?_r=0&pagewanted=all  newspaper=The New York Times  first1=Peter  last1=Baker  first2=Michael R.  last2=Gordon}}</ref>

Kerry said on September 9 in response to a reporters question about whether Syrian President Bashar al-Assad could avert a military strike: "He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week. Turn it over, all of it, without delay, and allow a full and total accounting for that. But he isnt about to do it, and it cant be done, obviously." This unscripted remark initiated a process that would lead to Syria agreeing to relinquish and destroy its chemical weapons arsenal, as Russia treated Kerrys statement as a serious proposal. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would work "immediately" to convince Syria relinquish and destroy its large chemical weapons arsenal.<ref>{{cite news  date=September 10, 2013  title=Syria timeline: how Kerrys gaffe became a plan  url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/syria-timeline-how-kerrys-gaffe-became-a-plan-20130910-2ti4z.html  newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald }}</ref><ref>{{cite news  date=September 9, 2013  title=John Kerrys Gaffe Heard Round the World  url=http://www.thewire.com/politics/2013/09/gaffe-heard-round-world/69205/  newspaper=The Wire }}</ref><ref>{{cite news  date=September 9, 2013  title=Kerrys Syria gaffe gains swift traction  url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ias_Ba-6bNuttPmPTTgcVZp1BUhw?docId=CNG.57b1e73f97bfc9c11ac2f3f75999a7f9.4e1  agency=AFP }}</ref><ref>{{cite news  date=September 9, 2013  title=White Houses Syria gaffe offers Obama a chance to climb back from war  url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/09/white-house-syria-gaffe-obama-war  agency=The Guardian}}</ref> Syria quickly welcomed this proposal and on September 14, the UN formally accepted Syrias application to join the convention banning chemical weapons, and separately, the U.S. and Russia agreed on a plan to eliminate Syrias chemical weapons by the middle of 2014, leading Kerry to declare on July 20, 2014: "we struck a deal where we got 100 percent of the chemical weapons out."<ref>http://www.politifact.com/john-kerry-syria-archive/</ref>  On September 28, the UN Security Council passed a resolution ordering the destruction of Syrias chemical weapons and condemning the August 21 Ghouta attack.<ref>{{cite news  date=October 6, 2013  title=Timeline of events leading up to Syria chemical disarmament  url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/131006/timeline-events-leading-syria-chemical-disarmament  agency=AFP}}</ref>

===Latin America===
In a speech before the Organization of American States in November 2013, Kerry remarked that the era of the Monroe Doctrine was over. He went on to explain, "The relationship that we seek and that we have worked hard to foster is not about a United States declaration about how and when it will intervene in the affairs of other American states. Its about all of our countries viewing one another as equals, sharing responsibilities, cooperating on security issues, and adhering not to doctrine, but to the decisions that we make as partners to advance the values and the interests that we share."<ref>{{cite news last=Johnson first=Keith title=Kerry Makes It Official: Era of Monroe Doctrine Is Over url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/11/18/kerry-makes-it-official-era-of-monroe-doctrine-is-over/ newspaper=Wall Street Journal date=November 18, 2013}}</ref>

Kerry and his second wife, Portuguese Mozambique Mozambican-born businesswoman and philanthropist Teresa Heinz, the widow of Kerrys late Pennsylvania Republican Senate colleague John Heinz, were introduced to each other by Heinz at an Earth Day rally in 1990. Early the following year, Senator Heinz was killed in a plane crash near Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania Lower Merion. Teresa has three sons from her previous marriage to Heinz, Henry John IV, André Heinz André, and Christopher Heinz Christopher.<ref>{{cite news url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-05-23-heinz-kerry-cover_x.htm title=With Teresa, expect an unconventional campaign work=usatoday.com   first1=Jill last1=Lawrence date=May 26, 2004}}</ref> Heinz and Kerry were married on May 26, 1995, in Nantucket, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web url=http://old.post-gazette.com/nation/20020605teresanat1p1.asp title=What Teresa Heinz found and what she lost date= work=post-gazette.com accessdate=August 27, 2015}}</ref>

The Forbes 400 survey estimated in 2004 that Teresa Heinz Kerry had a net worth of $750 million. However, estimates have frequently varied, ranging from around $165 million to as high as $3.2 1000000000 (number) billion, according to a study in the Los Angeles Times. Regardless of which figure is correct, Kerry was the wealthiest U.S. Senator while serving in the Senate. Independent of Heinz, Kerry is wealthy in his own right, and is the beneficiary of at least four trusts inherited from Forbes family relatives, including his mother, Rosemary Forbes Kerry, who died in 2002. Forbes magazine (named for the Forbes family (publishers) Forbes family of publishers, unrelated to Kerry) estimated that if elected, and if Heinz family assets were included, Kerry would have been the third-richest U.S. President in history, when adjusted for inflation.<ref name=Ackman102904>{{cite news  first=Dan  last=Ackman  authorlink=Dan Ackman  title=Kerry Would Be Third-Richest U.S. President If Elected  url=https://www.forbes.com/2004/02/13/cx_da_0213kerry.html  work=Forbes date=October 29, 2004}}</ref> This assessment was based on Heinz and Kerrys combined assets, but the couple signed a prenuptial agreement that keeps their assets separate.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20040823.html  title=What is George W.
