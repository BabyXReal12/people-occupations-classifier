===Substance use===

There have been extensive stories about Quaids past abuse of cocaine. In a candid 2002 interview with Larry King on his talk show, after King asked about his motives for using drugs, Quaid responded,
"Well, you got to put it in context. Back in the late 1960s, early 1970s. That was back during the time where, you know, drugs were going to expand our minds and everybody was experimenting and everything. We were really getting high, we didnt know it. And cocaine at that time was considered harmless. You know. I remember magazine articles in People Magazine of doctors saying it is not addicting. It is just—alcohol is worse. So I think we all fell into that. But thats not the way it was."
When asked if he believed he had ever been addicted to the drugs, he responded, "It was a gradual thing. But it got to the point where I couldnt have any fun unless I had it. Which is a bad place to be." Later in the interview he said, "But I saw myself being dead in about five years if I didnt stop."<ref>{{Cite news url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0203/12/lkl.00.html  title=CNN.com – Transcripts  publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com  date=March 12, 2002  accessdate=September 20, 2010}}</ref>
