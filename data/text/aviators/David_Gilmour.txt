David Jon Gilmour, {{post-nominals CBE}} (born 6 March 1946) is an English guitarist, singer and songwriter who was a member of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd. He joined the group as guitarist and co-lead vocalist in 1968 shortly before the departure of founding member Syd Barrett.
Pink Floyd subsequently achieved international success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album) Wish You Were Here, Animals (Pink Floyd album) Animals, and The Wall. By the early 1980s, they had become one of the bestselling and most acclaimed acts in music history; by 2012, the band had sold over 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million units sold in the United States.
Following the departure of Roger Waters in 1985, Gilmour assumed leadership of Pink Floyd; they released three more studio albums before disbanding in 2014.

Gilmour has produced a variety of artists, such as the The Dream Academy Dream Academy, and has released four solo studio albums: David Gilmour (album) David Gilmour, About Face (album) About Face, On an Island, and Rattle That Lock. He is also credited for bringing songwriter Kate Bush to public attention. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2005, Gilmour was made a Order of the British Empire Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to music.{{sfn Blake 2008 p=378}} He was awarded with the Outstanding Contribution title at the 2008 Q Awards.
In 2011, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 14 in their list of the greatest guitarists of all time.
He was voted number 36 in the greatest voices in rock by Planet Rock (radio station) Planet Rock listeners in 2009.
Gilmour has taken part in projects related to issues including animal rights, environmentalism, homelessness, poverty, and human rights. He has married twice and is the father of eight children.

==Early life and education==
David Jon Gilmour was born on 6 March 1946 in Cambridge, England.{{sfn Fitch 2005 p=115}} His father, Douglas Gilmour, eventually became a senior lecturer in zoology at the University of Cambridge, and his mother, Sylvia (née Wilson), trained as a teacher and later worked as a film editor for the BBC.
At the time of Gilmours birth they lived in Trumpington, Cambridgeshire, but in 1956, after several relocations, the family moved to Grantchester Meadows.
{{refn group=n Gilmour has three siblings: Peter, Mark and Catherine.{{sfn Blake 2008 p=14}}}}

Gilmours parents encouraged him to pursue his interest in music, and in 1954 he bought his first single, Bill Haleys "Rock Around the Clock".{{sfn Manning 2006 pp=10–11}} His enthusiasm for music was stirred the following year by Elvis Presleys "Heartbreak Hotel", and later "Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song) Bye Bye Love" by the Everly Brothers piqued his interest in the guitar. He borrowed a guitar from a neighbour, but never gave it back. Soon afterward, Gilmour started teaching himself to play using a book and record set by Pete Seeger.{{sfn Blake 2008 pp=18–19}} At age 11, Gilmour began attending the Perse School on Hills Road, Cambridge, which he did not enjoy.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=11}} There he met future Pink Floyd guitarist Syd Barrett and bassist Roger Waters, who attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys, which was also situated on Hills Road.{{sfn Blake 2008 pp=15–17}}

In 1962, Gilmour began studying GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom) A-Level modern languages at Cambridge Technical College.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=11}} Despite not finishing the course, he eventually learnt to speak fluent French.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=11}} Barrett was also a student at the college, and he spent his lunchtimes practising guitar with Gilmour.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=11}} In late 1962, Gilmour joined the blues rock band Jokers Wild (band) Jokers Wild. They recorded a one-sided album and a single (music) single at Regent Sound Studio, in west London, but only fifty copies of each were made.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=11}} In August 1965, Gilmour Street performance busked around Spain and France with Barrett and some other friends, performing songs by the Beatles. They were arrested on one occasion and destitute, which resulted in Gilmour requiring treatment in a hospital for malnutrition.
He and Barrett later Backpacking (wilderness) trekked to Paris, where they camped outside the city for a week and visited the Louvre.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=18}} During that time Gilmour worked in various places, most notably as the driver and assistant for fashion designer Ossie Clark.{{sfn Pattie Boyd: Wonderful Tonight, 2007 p=53  loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CNhh0TMLmmwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=wonderful+tonight&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z3VTVb2eN4LUgwTQgoGoCA&amp;ved=0CCgQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gilmour&amp;f=false]}}

Gilmour travelled to France in mid-1967 with Rick Wills and Willie Wilson (drummer) Willie Wilson, formerly of Jokers Wild. The trio performed under the name Flowers, then Bullitt, but were not commercially successful. After hearing their uninspired cover version covers of current chart hits, club owners were reluctant to pay them, and soon after their arrival in Paris, thieves stole their equipment.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=44}} While in France, Gilmour contributed—as a session musician—lead vocals to two songs on the soundtrack of the film Two Weeks in September, starring Brigitte Bardot.
In May, Gilmour briefly returned to London in search of new equipment. During his stay, he watched Pink Floyd record "See Emily Play" and was shocked to find that Barrett, who was beginning to suffer mental health problems, did not seem to recognise him.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=38}} When Bullitt returned to England later that year, they were so impoverished that their tour bus was completely empty of petrol and they had to push it off the ferry onto the landing.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=44}}

==Pink Floyd==
{{Main Pink Floyd}}
In late December 1967, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason approached Gilmour and asked him if he would be interested in joining the band to cover for the increasingly erratic Barrett. Gilmour accepted; they initially intended to continue with Barrett as a non-performing songwriter.
One of the groups business partners, Peter Jenner, said: "The idea was that Dave would ... cover for Barretts eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd was just going to write. Just to try to keep him involved."{{sfn Schaffner 1991 p=107}} By March 1968, working with Barrett had become too difficult; he agreed to leave the band and the others committed to moving on without him.{{sfn Blake 2008 pp= 112}}

After Barretts departure, Gilmour sang much of Pink Floyds lead vocals; Waters and keyboardist Richard Wright (musician) Richard Wright also occasionally sang lead. After the successes of The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album) Wish You Were Here, Waters took greater control of the band, writing and singing lead on most of Animals (Pink Floyd album) Animals and The Wall. Wright was fired during the sessions for The Wall; the relationship between Gilmour and Waters deteriorated during the making of the Pink Floyd – The Wall eponymous film, and during recording sessions for The Final Cut (album) The Final Cut. The final Pink Floyd performance of The Wall took place on 17 June 1981, at Earls Court, London;
it was Pink Floyds last appearance with Waters for almost 25 years.{{sfn Povey Russell 1997 p=185}}

File:David Gilmour and stratocaster.jpg thumb Gilmour performing with Pink Floyd in the mid-1970sBy the late 1970s, Gilmour had begun to think that his musical talents were being underused by Pink Floyd. In 1978 he channelled his ideas into his first solo album, David Gilmour (album) David Gilmour, which showcased his guitar playing and songwriting. Music written during the finishing stages of the album, but too late to be used, was incorporated into a song by Waters, which became "Comfortably Numb", included on The Wall.{{sfn Schaffner 1991 pp=221–222}} 

The negative atmosphere surrounding the creation of The Wall album and subsequent film, compounded by The Final Cut{{}}s virtually being a Roger Waters solo album, led Gilmour to produce his second solo album, About Face (album) About Face, in 1984.
He used it to express his feelings about a range of topics, from the murder of John Lennon
to his relationship with Waters. Gilmour toured Europe and the US along with support act the Television Personalities, who were dropped from the line-up after Dan Treacy  revealed Syd Barretts address on stage.{{sfn Schaffner 1991 p=123}} Mason also made a guest appearance on the UK leg of the tour, which despite some cancellations eventually turned a profit.{{sfn Blake 2008 p=304}} When he returned from touring, Gilmour played guitar with a range of artists, and also produced the Dream Academy, who had a US top ten hit with "Life in a Northern Town" in 1986.{{sfn Blake 2008 p=312}}

In 1985, Waters declared that Pink Floyd were "a spent force creatively".{{sfn Povey 2008 pp=240–241, 246}} Gilmour and Mason responded with a press release stating that Waters had quit the band and they intended to continue without him.{{sfn Povey 2008 p=240}} Gilmour assumed full control of the group and produced A Momentary Lapse of Reason in 1987, with some contributions from Mason and Richard Wright.
Wright officially rejoined the band after the release of the album for a lengthy world tour and helped create 1994s The Division Bell.
Gilmour explained: "I had a number of problems with the direction of the band in our recent past, before Roger left. I thought the songs were very wordy and that, because the specific meanings of those words were so important, the music became a mere vehicle for lyrics, and not a very inspiring one. Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here were so successful not just because of Rogers contributions, but also because there was a better balance between the music and the lyrics than there has been in more recent albums. Thats what Im trying to do with A Momentary Lapse of Reason; more focus on the music, restore the balance." In 1986, Gilmour purchased the houseboat Astoria (recording studio) Astoria, moored it on the River Thames near Hampton Court and transformed it into a recording studio.{{sfn Blake 2008 p=318}} The majority of the two Pink Floyd albums released about this time, as well as Gilmours 2006 solo album On an Island, were recorded there.

On 2 July 2005, Gilmour played with Pink Floyd—including Roger Waters—at Live 8. The performance caused a temporary sales increase of Pink Floyds album Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd.
Gilmour donated all of his profits to charities that reflect the goals of Live 8, saying: "Though the main objective has been to raise consciousness and put pressure on the G8 leaders, I will not profit from the concert. This is money that should be used to save lives."
He called upon all artists experiencing a surge in sales from Live 8 performances to donate the extra revenue to Live 8 fundraising. After the concert, Pink Floyd turned down an offer to tour the US for £150 million.
In 2006, Gilmour said that Pink Floyd would most likely never tour or write material again. He said: "I think enough is enough. I am 60 years old. I dont have the will to work as much any more. Pink Floyd was an important part in my life, I have had a wonderful time, but its over. For me its much less complicated to work alone."
In December 2006, Gilmour released a tribute to Syd Barrett, who had died on 7 July of that year, in the form of his own version of Pink Floyds first single "Arnold Layne".{{sfn Mabbett 2010 pp=140–141}} Recorded live at Londons Royal Albert Hall, the single featured versions of the song performed by Richard Wright and guest artist David Bowie.{{sfn Mabbett 2010 pp=140–141}} The single peaked on the UK Top 20 singles chart at number nineteen.
Since their Live 8 appearance in 2005, Gilmour has repeatedly said that there will be no Pink Floyd reunion. With the death of Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright in September 2008, another reunion of the core group members became impossible.
<span class="">
 On 7 November 2014, Pink Floyd released The Endless River.
</span>
Gilmour stated that it is Pink Floyds last album, saying: "I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ... Its a shame, but this is the end."
There
<span class="">
 was no tour to support the album, as Gilmour felt it was "kind of impossible" without Wright.
</span>
In August 2015, Gilmour reiterated that Pink Floyd were "done" and that to reunite without Wright "would just be wrong".
== Roy Harper ==

Gilmour has a long-standing association with Roy Harper (singer) Roy Harper, who was for a time managed by Pink Floyds former managers Blackhill Enterprises, recorded for the same label, Harvest Records, and who appeared on the same bill as Pink Floyd at 1968s Midsummer High Weekend free concert in Hyde Park, London Hyde Park.
Harper sang "Have a Cigar" on Pink Floyds 1975 Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album) Wish You Were Here album, and sang the song with them at that years Knebworth Festival.
Gilmour played on Harpers albums HQ (album) HQ (1975), The Unknown Soldier (album) The Unknown Soldier (1980) and Once (Roy Harper album) Once (1990).
Five of the ten songs on the second of these were co-compositions, one of which, "Short and Sweet", was first recorded for Gilmours first solo album.
Another, "You", also features Kate Bush, as does the title track on Once.
In April 1984, Harper made surprise guest appearance at Gilmours Hammersmith Odeon gig to sing "Short and Sweet".
This was included in Gilmours Live 1984 concert film. Harper also provided backing vocals on Gilmours About Face album.
While writing for About Face, Gilmour had a tune, and asked Pete Townshend of The Who to supply lyrics. This Townshend did, but Gilmour rejected them (Townshend would use both tune and lyrics, as ""White City Fighting", on his 1985 White City: A Novel album, which features Gilmour on that track, and on Give Blood (song) Give Blood). Gilmour then asked Harper for lyrics, but rejected those also, deciding not to use the tune on the album after all. Eventually Harper used his version, "Hope", which has a markedly slower tempo, on his 1985 album with Jimmy Page, called Whatever Happened to Jugula?.
== Kate Bush ==

Gilmour is credited for bringing songwriter Kate Bush to public attention.
While she was at school, Gilmour received a copy of her demo tape from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional demo tape recorded that would be more saleable to the record companies.
Three tracks were recorded and paid for by Gilmour.
The tape was produced by Gilmours friend Andrew Powell, who went on to produce Bushs first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick.
Gilmour arranged for EMI executive Terry Slater to hear the tape,
who was impressed and signed her.
Gilmour is credited as executive producer on two tracks on Bushs debut album The Kick Inside, including her second single "The Man with the Child in His Eyes".
He performs backing vocals on "Pull Out the Pin", on her fourth album, The Dreaming (album) The Dreaming,
and plays guitar on "Love and Anger (song) Love and Anger" and "Rockets Tail" on her sixth, The Sensual World.
In March 1987, Bush, notorious for the rarity of her live performances, sang "Running Up That Hill" at The Secret Policemans Balls The Secret Policemans Third Ball with Gilmour on guitar.
A three DVD set of The Secret Policemans Balls benefit concerts that includes their performance was released in 2009.
In 2002, she performed "Comfortably Numb", singing the part of the doctor, at Gilmours concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

On 11 July 2010, Gilmour performed for the charity Hoping Foundation with Roger Waters in Oxfordshire, England.
The performance was presented by Jemima Goldsmith and Nigella Lawson, and according to onlookers, it seemed that Gilmour and Waters had ended their long-running feud, laughing and joking together along with their respective partners. Waters subsequently confirmed on his Facebook page that Gilmour would play "Comfortably Numb" with him during one of his shows on his upcoming The Wall Live (2010–13) The Wall Live tour – Gilmour performed the song with Waters on 12 May 2011 at The O2, London and, with Nick Mason, played with the rest of the band on "Outside the Wall (song) Outside the Wall" at the conclusion of the show.

on which he co-wrote every track and their subsequent parts, and produced, played guitar and sang. In 2011, Rolling Stone placed Gilmour at number 14 in a list of the hundred greatest guitarists of all time.{{sfn Wenner 2011 p=59}}

Graham Nash and Phil Taylor, Gilmours guitar technician, both stated that Gilmour was working on a new studio album
to be completed during 2014, featuring Nash along with his long-time collaborator David Crosby. Gilmours wife, Polly Samson has also stated via her Twitter account that she has been writing lyrics for her husband.File:David_Gilmour_Rattle_That_Rock_World_Tour_-_Buenos_Aires_(23226730013).jpg thumb 300px Gilmour performing in Buenos Aires, Argentina, during the Rattle That Lock Tour, 19 December 2015. Gilmour is playing "The Workmate", a well-worn Fender Telecaster.

On 29 October 2014, Gilmour told Rolling Stone magazine that his new album was "coming along very well", that "theres a few months work in it yet" and that he is "hoping to get it out this following year" (in 2015). In addition to the new album, Gilmour confirmed that there would also be a tour, but not a massive 200-date tour, more like an "old mans tour", adding: "There havent been many discussions about the tour. But places like Radio City Music Hall sound like the right sort of vibe for me."
On 4 March 2015, Gilmour announced a tour of the UK and Europe planned from September to October 2015, his first live tour in nine years, coinciding with the release of his fourth solo studio album.
On 16 July 2015, the first tour dates in 10 years were announced for North America for March to April 2016.

==Musical style==
Gilmour is primarily regarded as a lead guitarist. His style is characterised by blues-influenced phrasing, expressive note bends, and sustain. In 2006, Gilmour said of his playing: "[My] fingers make a distinctive sound... [they] arent very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable".
He said his melodic sense was influenced by artists such as Hank Marvin and the Shadows.
In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmours playing as "characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures". Rolling Stone critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmours guitar work as an integral element of Pink Floyds sound. Di Perna described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, and described him as "the missing link between Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen Van Halen."
Gilmour credits guitarists such as Pete Seeger, Lead Belly, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, and Jimi Hendrix as early influences.
Gilmour has been ranked one of the greatest guitarists of all time by publications including Rolling Stone
and the Telegraph.
In January 2007, Guitar World readers voted Gilmours solos for "Comfortably Numb", "Time (Pink Floyd song) Time" and "Money (Pink Floyd song) Money" among the top 100 greatest guitar solos.
In 1996, Gilmour was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd.

Early in his career with Pink Floyd, Gilmour played a multitude of Fender Stratocasters. He recorded one of his guitar solos, for "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2", in one take using no editing or mixing using a 1955 Gibson Les Paul Gold Top guitar equipped with P-90 pick-ups.{{sfn Fitch Mahon 2006 pp=75–76}} 

Although mainly known for his guitar work, Gilmour is also a multi-instrumentalist. He played bass on some Pink Floyd tracks, and plays keyboard instrument keyboards, synthesiser, banjo, lap steel, mandolin, harmonica, drums, and saxophone.
==Charity==
Gilmour has been associated with various charity organisations. In May 2003, Gilmour sold his house in Maida Vale Little Venice to the Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer ninth Earl Spencer and donated the proceeds worth £3.6 million to Crisis (charity) Crisis to help fund a housing project for the homeless. He has been named a vice-president of the organisation.
