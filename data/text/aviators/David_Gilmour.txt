Gilmour has produced a variety of artists, such as the The Dream Academy Dream Academy, and has released four solo studio albums: David Gilmour (album) David Gilmour, About Face (album) About Face, On an Island, and Rattle That Lock. He is also credited for bringing songwriter Kate Bush to public attention. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005.

==Early life and education==
David Jon Gilmour was born on 6 March 1946 in Cambridge, England.{{sfn Fitch 2005 p=115}} His father, Douglas Gilmour, eventually became a senior lecturer in zoology at the University of Cambridge, and his mother, Sylvia (née Wilson), trained as a teacher and later worked as a film editor for the BBC.<ref name="WH">{{Cite episode  series=BBC Two  title=David Gilmour: Wider Horizons  url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06pyrbs  accessdate=14 November 2015  network=BBC  date=14 November 2015  transcript=   transcripturl= }}</ref> At the time of Gilmours birth they lived in Trumpington, Cambridgeshire, but in 1956, after several relocations, the family moved to Grantchester Meadows.<ref>{{harvnb Blake 2008 p=14}}: the house in Trumpington; {{harvnb Manning 2006 pp=10–11}}.</ref>{{refn group=n Gilmour has three siblings: Peter, Mark and Catherine.{{sfn Blake 2008 p=14}}}}

Gilmours parents encouraged him to pursue his interest in music, and in 1954 he bought his first single, Bill Haleys "Rock Around the Clock".{{sfn Manning 2006 pp=10–11}} His enthusiasm for music was stirred the following year by Elvis Presleys "Heartbreak Hotel", and later "Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song) Bye Bye Love" by the Everly Brothers piqued his interest in the guitar. He borrowed a guitar from a neighbour, but never gave it back. Soon afterward, Gilmour started teaching himself to play using a book and record set by Pete Seeger.{{sfn Blake 2008 pp=18–19}} At age 11, Gilmour began attending the Perse School on Hills Road, Cambridge, which he did not enjoy.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=11}} There he met future Pink Floyd guitarist Syd Barrett and bassist Roger Waters, who attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys, which was also situated on Hills Road.{{sfn Blake 2008 pp=15–17}}

In 1962, Gilmour began studying GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom) A-Level modern languages at Cambridge Technical College.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=11}} Despite not finishing the course, he eventually learnt to speak fluent French.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=11}} Barrett was also a student at the college, and he spent his lunchtimes practising guitar with Gilmour.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=11}} In late 1962, Gilmour joined the blues rock band Jokers Wild (band) Jokers Wild. They recorded a one-sided album and a single (music) single at Regent Sound Studio, in west London, but only fifty copies of each were made.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=11}} In August 1965, Gilmour Street performance busked around Spain and France with Barrett and some other friends, performing songs by the Beatles. They were arrested on one occasion and destitute, which resulted in Gilmour requiring treatment in a hospital for malnutrition.<ref>{{harvnb Manning 2006 p=18}}: arrested for busking; {{cite web url=http://www.megapinkfloyd.com/band_members_david_gilmour.asp  title=PINK FLOYD&nbsp;– David Gilmour Photos, Biography, Apparel  publisher=Megapinkfloyd.com  accessdate=9 August 2010  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714065947/http://www.megapinkfloyd.com/band_members_david_gilmour.asp  archivedate=14 July 2011}}: malnutrition.</ref> He and Barrett later Backpacking (wilderness) trekked to Paris, where they camped outside the city for a week and visited the Louvre.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=18}} During that time Gilmour worked in various places, most notably as the driver and assistant for fashion designer Ossie Clark.{{sfn Pattie Boyd: Wonderful Tonight, 2007 p=53  loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CNhh0TMLmmwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=wonderful+tonight&hl=en&sa=X&ei=z3VTVb2eN4LUgwTQgoGoCA&ved=0CCgQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&q=gilmour&f=false]}}

Gilmour travelled to France in mid-1967 with Rick Wills and Willie Wilson (drummer) Willie Wilson, formerly of Jokers Wild. The trio performed under the name Flowers, then Bullitt, but were not commercially successful. After hearing their uninspired cover version covers of current chart hits, club owners were reluctant to pay them, and soon after their arrival in Paris, thieves stole their equipment.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=44}} While in France, Gilmour contributed—as a session musician—lead vocals to two songs on the soundtrack of the film Two Weeks in September, starring Brigitte Bardot.<ref name="WH" /> In May, Gilmour briefly returned to London in search of new equipment. During his stay, he watched Pink Floyd record "See Emily Play" and was shocked to find that Barrett, who was beginning to suffer mental health problems, did not seem to recognise him.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=38}} When Bullitt returned to England later that year, they were so impoverished that their tour bus was completely empty of petrol and they had to push it off the ferry onto the landing.{{sfn Manning 2006 p=44}}

==Pink Floyd==
{{Main Pink Floyd}}
In late December 1967, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason approached Gilmour and asked him if he would be interested in joining the band to cover for the increasingly erratic Barrett. Gilmour accepted; they initially intended to continue with Barrett as a non-performing songwriter.<ref>{{harvnb Mason 2005 pp=109–111}}: (primary source); {{harvnb Povey 2008 p=47}}: (secondary source).</ref> One of the groups business partners, Peter Jenner, said: "The idea was that Dave would&nbsp;... cover for Barretts eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd was just going to write. Just to try to keep him involved."{{sfn Schaffner 1991 p=107}} By March 1968, working with Barrett had become too difficult; he agreed to leave the band and the others committed to moving on without him.{{sfn Blake 2008 pp= 112}}

After Barretts departure, Gilmour sang much of Pink Floyds lead vocals; Waters and keyboardist Richard Wright (musician) Richard Wright also occasionally sang lead. After the successes of The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album) Wish You Were Here, Waters took greater control of the band, writing and singing lead on most of Animals (Pink Floyd album) Animals and The Wall. Wright was fired during the sessions for The Wall; the relationship between Gilmour and Waters deteriorated during the making of the Pink Floyd – The Wall eponymous film, and during recording sessions for The Final Cut (album) The Final Cut. The final Pink Floyd performance of The Wall took place on 17 June 1981, at Earls Court, London;<ref>{{cite web url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/pink-floyd-final-concert-roger-waters/ title=The Day Pink Floyd Played Their Final Concert With Roger Waters website=Ultimate Classic Rock accessdate=12 July 2018}}</ref> it was Pink Floyds last appearance with Waters for almost 25 years.{{sfn Povey Russell 1997 p=185}}

File:David Gilmour and stratocaster.jpg thumb Gilmour performing with Pink Floyd in the mid-1970sBy the late 1970s, Gilmour had begun to think that his musical talents were being underused by Pink Floyd. In 1978 he channelled his ideas into his first solo album, David Gilmour (album) David Gilmour, which showcased his guitar playing and songwriting. Music written during the finishing stages of the album, but too late to be used, was incorporated into a song by Waters, which became "Comfortably Numb", included on The Wall.{{sfn Schaffner 1991 pp=221–222}} 

The negative atmosphere surrounding the creation of The Wall album and subsequent film, compounded by The Final Cut{{}}s virtually being a Roger Waters solo album, led Gilmour to produce his second solo album, About Face (album) About Face, in 1984.<ref name="Mabbett-1">{{cite book  edition = Updated  publisher=Omnibus  isbn = 0-7119-4109-2  last = Miles  first = Barry author2=Andy Mabbett  title = Pink Floyd the visual documentary  location = London  year = 1994}}</ref> He used it to express his feelings about a range of topics, from the murder of John Lennon<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> to his relationship with Waters. Gilmour toured Europe and the US along with support act the Television Personalities, who were dropped from the line-up after Dan Treacy  revealed Syd Barretts address on stage.{{sfn Schaffner 1991 p=123}} Mason also made a guest appearance on the UK leg of the tour, which despite some cancellations eventually turned a profit.{{sfn Blake 2008 p=304}} When he returned from touring, Gilmour played guitar with a range of artists, and also produced the Dream Academy, who had a US top ten hit with "Life in a Northern Town" in 1986.{{sfn Blake 2008 p=312}}

In 1985, Waters declared that Pink Floyd were "a spent force creatively".{{sfn Povey 2008 pp=240–241, 246}} Gilmour and Mason responded with a press release stating that Waters had quit the band and they intended to continue without him.{{sfn Povey 2008 p=240}} Gilmour assumed full control of the group and produced A Momentary Lapse of Reason in 1987, with some contributions from Mason and Richard Wright.<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> Wright officially rejoined the band after the release of the album for a lengthy world tour and helped create 1994s The Division Bell.<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> Gilmour explained: "I had a number of problems with the direction of the band in our recent past, before Roger left. I thought the songs were very wordy and that, because the specific meanings of those words were so important, the music became a mere vehicle for lyrics, and not a very inspiring one. Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here were so successful not just because of Rogers contributions, but also because there was a better balance between the music and the lyrics than there has been in more recent albums. Thats what Im trying to do with A Momentary Lapse of Reason; more focus on the music, restore the balance." In 1986, Gilmour purchased the houseboat Astoria (recording studio) Astoria, moored it on the River Thames near Hampton Court and transformed it into a recording studio.{{sfn Blake 2008 p=318}} The majority of the two Pink Floyd albums released about this time, as well as Gilmours 2006 solo album On an Island, were recorded there.<ref name="Mabbett-2">{{cite book  publisher=Omnibus,  isbn = 978-1-84938-370-7  last = Mabbett

On 2 July 2005, Gilmour played with Pink Floyd—including Roger Waters—at Live 8.

This is money that should be used to save lives."<ref name=giveback /> He called upon all artists experiencing a surge in sales from Live 8 performances to donate the extra revenue to Live 8 fundraising.

In 2006, Gilmour said that Pink Floyd would most likely never tour or write material again. He said: "I think enough is enough. I am 60 years old. I dont have the will to work as much any more. Pink Floyd was an important part in my life, I have had a wonderful time, but its over.

Since their Live 8 appearance in 2005, Gilmour has repeatedly said that there will be no Pink Floyd reunion. With the death of Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright in September 2008, another reunion of the core group members became impossible.<ref>{{cite web last=Booth first=Robert title=Pink Floyds Richard Wright dies  url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/16/pinkfloyd.popandrock  date= 16 September 2008  accessdate=16 October 2013 work=The Guardian}}</ref> <span class="">On 7 November 2014, Pink Floyd released The Endless River.</span><ref name="amazon-gb">{{cite web url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00NPZI1ZS title=The Endless River: Amazon.co.uk: Music website=Amazon.com Amazon.co.uk publisher=Amazon.com, Inc. accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> Gilmour stated that it is Pink Floyds last album, saying: "I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ...

== Roy Harper ==

Gilmour has a long-standing association with Roy Harper (singer) Roy Harper, who was for a time managed by Pink Floyds former managers Blackhill Enterprises, recorded for the same label, Harvest Records, and who appeared on the same bill as Pink Floyd at 1968s Midsummer High Weekend free concert in Hyde Park, London Hyde Park.<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> Harper sang "Have a Cigar" on Pink Floyds 1975 Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album) Wish You Were Here album, and sang the song with them at that years Knebworth Festival.<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> Gilmour played on Harpers albums HQ (album) HQ (1975), The Unknown Soldier (album) The Unknown Soldier (1980) and Once (Roy Harper album) Once (1990).<ref name="Mabbett-1" />  Five of the ten songs on the second of these were co-compositions, one of which, "Short and Sweet", was first recorded for Gilmours first solo album.<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> Another, "You", also features Kate Bush, as does the title track on Once.<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> In April 1984, Harper made surprise guest appearance at Gilmours Hammersmith Odeon gig to sing "Short and Sweet".<ref name="Mabbett-1" /> This was included in Gilmours Live 1984 concert film. Harper also provided backing vocals on Gilmours About Face album.<ref name="Mabbett-1" />

While writing for About Face, Gilmour had a tune, and asked Pete Townshend of The Who to supply lyrics. This Townshend did, but Gilmour rejected them (Townshend would use both tune and lyrics, as ""White City Fighting", on his 1985 White City: A Novel album, which features Gilmour on that track, and on Give Blood (song) Give Blood). Gilmour then asked Harper for lyrics, but rejected those also, deciding not to use the tune on the album after all. Eventually Harper used his version, "Hope", which has a markedly slower tempo, on his 1985 album with Jimmy Page, called Whatever Happened to Jugula?.<ref name="Mabbett-1" />

Gilmour used the guitar in the 2004 The Strat Pack Strat Pack show that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Stratocaster at Wembley Arena along with one of his Candy Apple Red Stratocasters (famous for their appearances with Gilmour from 1987 to 2004). It is not the first Fender Stratocaster ever made as prototypes had already been constructed before this one. The origin of the guitar is unknown, and isnt clear whether it is the real 0001 Strat because the neck (which has the 0001 serial number on it) could have been taken off the original.<ref name="Gilmourish">{{cite web url=http://www.gilmourish.com/?page_id=259  title=The #0001 Stratocaster  work=Gilmourish.com  accessdate=}}</ref> The model was used as a spare and for slide guitar in subsequent years.
