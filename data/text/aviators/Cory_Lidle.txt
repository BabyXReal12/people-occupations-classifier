After being traded, he criticized his former team: "On the days Im pitching, its almost a coin flip as to know if the guys behind me are going to be there to play 100 percent." He noted he was joining a Yankee team that expects to win all the time: "Thats why Im most excited about it. Sometimes I felt I got caught up kind of going into the clubhouse nonchalantly sometimes, because all the other guys in the clubhouse didnt go there with one goal in mind."
In his first start for the Yankees, he went six innings, giving up one run on four hit (baseball) hits, wikt:en route en route to an 8-1 Yankee victory as part of a sweep against the Toronto Blue Jays.

He was criticized for telling a reporter, "We got matched up with a team that, I think, was a little more ready to play than we were," which was taken by some as a jab at manager Joe Torre. For damage control, he called the radio talk show Mike and the Mad Dog and gave an extended defense of himself and the Yankees.
The snippy exchange was punctuated by co-host Chris Russos implication that Lidle was not entitled to "enjoy a day in New York" and co-host Mike Francesa commenting, "I havent thought much about you at all, to be honest with you." Following reports of his death, both hosts of the popular New York radio show expressed remorse for their hostility to him.

Lidle threw an 88–90 mph fastball with cut and sink. He threw a low-70s curveball to keep hitters off balance, and a low-80s slider.  He was a finesse pitcher who had to rely on changing speeds and pinpoint location.
