After being traded, he criticized his former team: "On the days Im pitching, its almost a coin flip as to know if the guys behind me are going to be there to play 100 percent." He noted he was joining a Yankee team that expects to win all the time: "Thats why Im most excited about it. Sometimes I felt I got caught up kind of going into the clubhouse nonchalantly sometimes, because all the other guys in the clubhouse didnt go there with one goal in mind."<ref>Associated Press, [http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2536712 "Lidle backs off criticism, but Rhodes keeps firing"] from ESPN.com, August 2, 2006.</ref>

He was criticized for telling a reporter, "We got matched up with a team that, I think, was a little more ready to play than we were," which was taken by some as a jab at manager Joe Torre. For damage control, he called the radio talk show Mike and the Mad Dog and gave an extended defense of himself and the Yankees.<ref name="kepner" /> The snippy exchange was punctuated by co-host Chris Russos implication that Lidle was not entitled to "enjoy a day in New York" and co-host Mike Francesa commenting, "I havent thought much about you at all, to be honest with you." Following reports of his death, both hosts of the popular New York radio show expressed remorse for their hostility to him.<ref>Neil Best, "Francesa feels haunted by Lidle interview" from Newsday, October 12, 2006.</ref><ref>Andrew Marchand, "Interview got ugly" from the New York Post, October 12, 2006.</ref>
