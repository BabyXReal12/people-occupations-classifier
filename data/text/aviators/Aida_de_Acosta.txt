Aida de Acosta Root Breckinridge (July 28, 1884 – May 26, 1962) was an American socialite and the first woman to fly a powered aircraft solo.<ref name=ruiz>{{cite book url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_62IjQ-XQScC&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=%22Elihu+Root%22+aida+divorce&source=bl&ots=WM8JoyitPQ&sig=s6Ktu6M6z5PZ4LNYUtl7JhpWHDE&hl=en&ei=t2ZFSp-ICZmMtgfGsOGxAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1 title=Latinas in the United States: a historical encyclopedia first=Vicki last=Ruíz author2=Virginia Sánchez Korrol publisher=Indiana University Press year=2006 isbn=0-253-34681-9 page=189}}</ref> In 1903, while in Paris with her mother, she caught her first glimpse of dirigibles. She then proceeded to take only three flight lessons, before taking to the sky by herself.

Later in life, after losing sight in one eye to glaucoma, she became an advocate for improved eye care and was executive director of the first eye bank in America.<ref name=hess>{{cite book title=Americas political dynasties url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4HZVCTQvkEC&pg=PA268&dq=%22oren+root%22+%22Aida+de+Acosta%22&num=100&ei=Be9EStK2H5WKzQSEqbRN first=Stephen last=Hess page=268 publisher=Transaction Publishers year=1997 isbn=1-56000-911-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite news url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,896333,00.html title=Milestones date=June 8, 1962 work=Time (magazine) Time}}</ref>

==Early life==
Aida was born in the Elberon, New Jersey Elberon section of Long Branch, New Jersey, in 1884 to Ricardo de Acosta, a steamship executive of Cuban descent, and Micaela Hernández de Alba y de Alba, reputedly a descendant of the Alba family, famous in the history of Spain as the House of Alba Dukes of Alba.<ref>{{cite book title=Current Biography Yearbook first=Maxine last=Block author2=Anna Herthe Rothe author3= Marjorie Dent Candee publisher=H. W. Wilson Co. year=1954 page=115}}</ref> Among her seven siblings were the writers and socialites Mercedes de Acosta and Rita de Acosta Lydig.

==The flight==
On June 27, 1903, in Paris, when Acosta was nineteen, Brazilian pioneer aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont showed her how to operate his personal dirigible, “No. 9.” Santos-Dumont was the toast of Paris at the time, flying his dirigible downtown to his favorite restaurant and parking it on the street while he had dinner. Acosta flew Santos-Dumont’s aircraft solo from Paris to Château de Bagatelle while Santos-Dumont rode his bicycle along below, waving his arms and shouting advice.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/wmntrans2.pdf  format=pdf  title=Women in Transportation: Changing Americas History, Reference Materials  publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation  pages=10  date=March 1998  accessdate=}}</ref>

Acosta later recalled that upon her first landing, Santos-Dumont asked her how she had fared. "It is very nice, M. Santos-Dumont," she replied. "Mademoiselle," he cried, "vous êtes la première aero-chauffeuse du monde!" ("Miss, you are the first woman aero-driver in the world!"). She was in fact the first woman to pilot any kind of motorized aircraft, nearly six months before the Wright brothers first flew in a heavier-than-air powered aircraft.<ref name=register>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19530812&id=NIgRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tuIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5208,435372 work=Eugene Register-Guard title=She Beat Wright Bros. – American Girl Flew First Powered Aircraft date=Aug 12, 1953}}</ref>

The first flight ended in the polo field at Château de Bagatelle Bagatelle at the northern end of the Bois de Boulogne, during a match between the American team and the British team. Spectators assisted her from the basket. After watching some polo with Santos-Dumont, Acosta climbed back into the basket and flew the machine back to Neuilly-sur-Seine Neuilly St. James, the entire trip lasting one and a half hours.

==Flight aftermath==

Hearing about the flight, her parents were appalled. They were certain that no man would marry a woman who had done such a thing, so they managed to hush it all up until many years later when in the 1930s she recounted the story to her husband and a young naval officer named Lieutenant George Calnan over dinner.

Acosta is the only person that Santos-Dumont ever permitted to fly any of his many aircraft. Also, Santos-Dumont, a lifelong bachelor with no known romantic ties, kept a photograph of Acosta on his desk, next to a vase of fresh flowers, for the rest of his life. Nonetheless, there is no indication that Santos-Dumont and Acosta stayed in touch after her flight. Upon Santos-Dumonts death Acosta was reported as saying that she hardly knew the man.

==Eye care advocacy==
