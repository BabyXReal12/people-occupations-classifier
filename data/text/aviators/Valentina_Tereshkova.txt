Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova ({{lang-rus Валенти́на Влади́мировна Терешко́ва p=vɐlʲɪnʲˈtʲinə vlɐˈdʲimʲɪrəvnə tʲɪrʲɪʂˈkovə a=Valentina Tereshkova.ogg}}; born 6 March 1937) is a retired Russian cosmonaut, engineer, and politician. She is the List of female astronauts first Women in space woman to have flown in space, having been selected from more than 400 applicants and five finalists to pilot Vostok 6 on 16 June 1963. 

In order to join the Cosmonaut Corps, Tereshkova was honorarily inducted into the Soviet Air Force and thus she also became the first civilian to fly in space.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.yarregion.ru/eng/Pages/famous_people_Valentina_Vladimirovna_Tereshkova.aspx  title=Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova  work=Yaroslavl Region  year=2016  accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>

Before her recruitment as a cosmonaut, Tereshkova was a textile-factory assembly worker and an amateur skydiver. After the dissolution of the first group of female cosmonauts in 1969, she became a prominent member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, holding various political offices. She remained politically active following the collapse of the Soviet Union and is regarded as a hero in post-Soviet Russia and much of the world. Having orbited Earth 48 times, Tereshkova remains the only woman ever to have been on a solo space mission.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.rt.com/news/379550-tereshkova-facts-80-anniversary title=8 surprising facts about stellar career of Valentina Tereshkova, the 1st woman in space website=rt.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/mar/29/valentina-tereshkova-first-woman-in-space-people-waste-money-on-wars title=The first woman in space: People shouldn’t waste money on wars first=Mary last=Dejevsky date=29 March 2017 website=the Guardian}}</ref>

==Early life==
Tereshkova was born in the village of Bolshoye Maslennikovo Maslennikovo in Tutayevsky District, Yaroslavl Oblast, in central Russia. Her parents had migrated from Belarus.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://nn.by/?c=ar&i=25785  title=Першая жанчына‑касманаўт ў дзяцінстве гаварыла па‑беларуску  trans-title=The first woman in space spoke Belarusian as a child  work=Nasha Niva  date=24 April 2009  accessdate=3 April 2016  language=Belarusian}}</ref> Tereshkovas father was a tractor driver and her mother worked in a textile plant. Tereshkova went to school in 1945 at the age 8; however, she left school in 1953 at 16 and continued her education by correspondence courses.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/whos_who_level2/tereshkova.html  title=Valentina Tereshkova  work=StarChild: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center  year=2016  accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>

She became interested in parachuting from a young age, and trained in skydiving at the local Aeroclub, making her first jump at age 22 on 21 May 1959; at the time, she was employed as a textile worker in a local factory. It was her expertise in skydiving that led to her selection as a cosmonaut. In 1961, she became Secretary of the local Komsomol (Young Communist League) and later joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbRxuvmiXKY  title=President Vladimir Putin of Russia Congratulates Valentina Tereshkova, First Woman In Space on 80th Birthday   website=YouTube.com  publisher=Russia Today  date=6 March 2017  accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref>

==Career in the Soviet space program==

After the flight of Yuri Gagarin in 1961, Sergey Korolyov, the chief Soviet rocket engineer, came up with the idea of putting a woman in space. On 16 February 1962, Valentina Tereshkova was selected to join the female cosmonaut corps. Out of more than 400 applicants, five were selected: Tatyana Kuznetsova, Irina Solovyova, Zhanna Yorkina, Valentina Ponomaryova, and Tereshkova. Qualifications included that they be parachutists under 30 years of age, under {{Convert 170 cm ftin abbr=on}} tall, and under {{Convert 70 kg lb abbr=on 0}} in weight.<ref>{{cite web  url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34270395  title=Valentina Tereshkova: USSR was worried about women in space  first=Pallab  last=Ghosh  work=BBC News  date=17 September 2015  accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>

Tereshkova was considered a particularly worthy candidate, partly due to her "proletarian" background, and because her father, tank leader sergeant Vladimir Tereshkov, was a war hero. He died in the Finnish Winter War during World War II in the Lemetti area in Finnish Karelia when Tereshkova was two years old. After her mission, she was asked how the Soviet Union should thank her for her service to the country. Tereshkova asked that the government search for, and publish, the location where her father was killed in action. This was done, and a monument now stands at the site in Lemetti—now on the Russian side of the border. Tereshkova has since visited Finland several times.

Training included weightless flights, isolation tests, centrifuge tests, rocket theory, spacecraft engineering, 120 parachute jumps and pilot training in Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 MiG-15UTI jet fighters. The group spent several months in intensive training, concluding with examinations in November 1962, after which four remaining candidates were commissioned Junior Lieutenants in the Soviet Air Force. Tereshkova, Solovyova and Ponomaryova were the leading candidates, and a joint mission profile was developed that would see two women launched into space, on solo Vostok flights on consecutive days in March or April 1963.<ref name="earthmagazine">{{cite journal  url=http://www.earthmagazine.org/article/benchmarks-june-16-1963-june-18-1983-valentina-tereshkova-and-sally-ride-become-first-and  first=Megan  last=Sever  title=June 16, 1963 & June 18, 1983: Valentina Tereshkova and Sally Ride Become First and Third Women in Space  journal=Earth (magazine) Earth  date=June 2014  volume=59  issue=6  pages=60–61  accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>

Originally it was intended that Tereshkova would launch first in Vostok 5 while Ponomaryova would follow her into orbit in Vostok 6. However, this flight plan was altered in March 1963. Vostok 5 would now carry a male cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky flying the joint mission with a woman aboard Vostok 6 in June 1963. The State Space Commission nominated Tereshkova to pilot Vostok 6 at their meeting on 21 May and this was confirmed by Nikita Khrushchev himself.<ref>{{cite book  first1=Colin  last1=Burgis  first2=Bert  last2=Vis  title=Interkosmos: The Eastern Blocs Early Space Program  publisher=Springer Paxis Books  year=2015  isbn=978-3319241616}}</ref> Tereshkova was exactly ten years younger than the youngest Mercury Seven astronaut, Gordon Cooper.

After watching the successful launch of Vostok 5 on 14 June, Tereshkova began final preparations for her own flight. She was 26 at the time. On the morning of 16 June 1963, Tereshkova and her backup Solovyova were both dressed in spacesuits and taken to the launch pad by bus. After completing her communication and life support checks, she was sealed inside the Vostok. After a two-hour countdown, Vostok 6 launched faultlessly, and Tereshkova became the first woman in space.<ref>{{cite news  url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/11871598/Russia-forgot-to-send-toothbrush-with-first-woman-in-space.html  title=Russia forgot to send toothbrush with first woman in space   first=Sarah  last=Knapton  work=The Daily Telegraph  date=17 September 2015  accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref> Her call sign in this flight was Chaika (English: Seagull; {{lang-ru Ча́йка}}), later commemorated as the name of an asteroid, 1671 Chaika.<ref>{{cite journal  first=Kelly  last=Knight  title=Earth calling Seagull  journal=Astronomy (magazine) Astronomy  date=June 2003  volume=31  issue=6  page=30}}</ref>

Vostok 6 was the final Vostok flight and was launched two days after Vostok 5 which carried Valery Bykovsky into a similar orbit for five days, landing three hours after Tereshkova. The two vessels approached each other within {{convert 5 km mi abbr=on}} at one point, and Tereshkova communicated with Bykovsky and with Khrushchev by radio.

Even though there were plans for further flights by women, it took 19 years until the second woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, flew into space. None of the other four in Tereshkovas early group flew, and, in October 1969, the pioneering female cosmonaut group was dissolved.<ref name="earthmagazine"/>

After her flight, Tereshkova studied at the  Zhukovsky Air Force Academy  and graduated with distinction as a cosmonaut engineer. In 1977 she earned a doctorate in engineering.

==Soviet political career==
Due to her prominence, Tereshkova was chosen for several political positions: from 1966 to 1974 she was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, from 1974 to 1989 a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and from 1969 to 1991 she was in the Central Committee of the CPSU Central Committee of the Communist Party. In 1997, she was retired from the Russian Air Force and the cosmonaut corps by presidential order.

Beyond her recognized political offices within the Soviet Union, Tereshkova also became a well-known representative of the Soviet Union abroad. She was made a member of the World Peace Council in 1966, a member of the Yaroslavl Oblast Yaroslavl Soviet in 1967. She was also the Soviet representative to the UN Conference for the International Womens Year in Mexico City in 1975.

==Post-Soviet political career==

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tereshkova lost her political office but none of her prestige. To this day, she is revered as a hero, and to some her importance in Russian space history is only surpassed by Yuri Gagarin and Alexey Leonov. She was elected to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian legislature, in 2011 as a member of United Russia where she continues to serve.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.duma.gov.ru/structure/deputies/131193/  title=Терешкова Валентина Владимировна  trans-title=Tereshkova, Valentina Vladimirovna  work=State Duma The State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation  year=2016  accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>

Tereshkova was invited to Prime Minister Vladimir Putins residence in Novo-Ogaryovo for the celebration of her 70th birthday. While there she said that she would like to fly to Mars, even if it meant that it was a one-way trip.<ref name=Mars>{{cite news  url=https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSL0647601420070306  title=First woman in space dreams of flying to Mars  work=Reuters  accessdate=26 May 2008  date=6 March 2007}}</ref>
