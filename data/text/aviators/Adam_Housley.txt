Both Housley and his wife have received backlash on social media for their marriage, largely focusing on their interracial relationship and also because of his position at Fox News. He has aggressively defended his wife and family with some harsh words for those who levy racially charged insults. In one response, Housley said: "The fact that, in this day and age, we get attacked for our interracial relationship is beyond sad... it is pathetic. Yes I am white. Yes she is half black. Marrying a white man does not erase her color, and marrying a woman who is half black does not mean I am blinded. The problem isnt pigmentation... the problem is backwards, bigotry bigoted thought from people who should know better."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/fox-reporter-adam-housley-slams-bigoted-and-pathetic-racial-remarks-about-his-interracial-marriage/  title=Fox’s Adam Housley Slams ‘Bigoted’ and ‘Pathetic’ Racial Remarks About His Interracial Marriage  website=Mediaite.com  date=2014-01-14  accessdate=2016-08-17}}</ref>
