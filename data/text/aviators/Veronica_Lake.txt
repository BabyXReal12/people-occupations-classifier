Her father, Harry Ockelman, Jr., is listed as unmarried in the 1920 United States Census of Pennsylvania.</ref>&nbsp;– July 7, 1973) was an American film, stage, and television actress. Lake won both popular and critical acclaim for her role in Sullivans Travels and for femme fatale roles in film noirs with Alan Ladd, during the 1940s. She was also well known for her peek-a-boo hairstyle. Lakes career had begun to decline by the late 1940s, in part due to her alcoholism. She made only one film in the 1950s but appeared in several guest appearance roles on television. She returned to the screen in 1966 with a role in the film Footsteps in the Snow, but the role failed to revitalize her career.

Lake released her memoirs, Veronica: The Autobiography of Veronica Lake, in 1970. She used the money she made from the book to finance a low-budget horror film Flesh Feast (film) Flesh Feast. It was her final onscreen role. Lake died in July 1973 from hepatitis and acute kidney injury at the age of 50.

He died in an industrial explosion in Philadelphia in 1932. Lakes mother, Constance Frances Charlotta (née Trimble; 1902–1992), of Irish descent, married Anthony Keane, a newspaper staff artist, also of Irish descent, in 1933, and Lake began using his surname.<ref>{{cite journal date=May 17, 1943 title=I, Veronica journal=Life publisher=Time, Inc. volume=14 issue=20 page=78 issn=0024-3019 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=700EAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=veronica%20lake&f=false}}</ref>

The Keanes lived in Saranac Lake, New York, where young Lake attended St. Bernards School for a time, then was sent to Villa Maria (school) Villa Maria, an all-girls Catholic boarding school in Montreal Montreal, Quebec, Canada, from which she was expelled. Lake later claimed she attended McGill University and took a premed course for a year, intending to become a surgeon. With this being included in many press biographies (although she later declared her claim was a fabrication), Lake felt guilty and subsequently apologized to the president of McGill who was simply amused when she explained her habit of self-dramatizing.<ref>Life magazine, 17 May 1943, pg 82</ref> But when her stepfather fell ill during her second year, the Keane family later moved to Miami, Florida.<ref name="girl" /> Lake attended Miami High School, where she was known for her beauty. She had a troubled childhood and was diagnosed with schizophrenia, according to her mother.<ref>{{harv Chierichetti 2004 p=70}}</ref>

==Film career==
===Constance Keane===
In 1938, the Keanes moved to Beverly Hills, California, and while briefly under contract with MGM, Lake enrolled in that studios acting farm, the Bliss-Hayden School of Acting (now the Beverly Hills Playhouse). She made friends with a girl named Gwen Horn and accompanied her when Horn went to audition at RKO.<ref name="girl" /> She appeared in the play Thought for Food in January 1939.<ref>{{cite news date=January 29, 1939 title=Current Films newspaper=Los Angeles Times page=C4}}</ref> In She Made Her Bed, the theatre critic from the Los Angeles Times called her "a fetching little trick".<ref>{{cite news last=Von Blon first=Katherine date=August 21, 1939 title=She Made Her Bed newspaper=Los Angeles Times page=9}}</ref>

She also appeared as an extra in a number of movies.<ref>{{cite journal date=May 17, 1943 title=I, Veronica journal=Life publisher=Time, Inc. volume=14 issue=20 page=77 issn=0024-3019 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=700EAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=veronica%20lake&f=false}}</ref> Keanes first appearance on screen was for RKO Pictures RKO, playing a small role among several coeds in the film Sorority House (film) Sorority House (1939). The part wound up being cut out of the film, but she was encouraged to continue. Similar roles followed, including All Women Have Secrets, Young as You Feel (1940 film) Young as Your Feel, Forty Little Mothers and Dancing Co-Ed. Forty Little Mothers was the first time she let her hair down on screen.<ref name="strauss">{{cite news title=Veronica Lake, Full Face last=Strauss first=Theodore newspaper=New York Times date=November 8, 1942 page=X3}}</ref>

She attracted the interest of Fred Wilcox, an assistant director, who shot a test scene of Lake performing from a play and showed it to an agent. The agent, in turn, showed it to producer Arthur Hornblow Jr. who was looking for a new girl to play the part of a Nightclub act nightclub singer in a military drama, I Wanted Wings (1940). Still, in her teens, the role would make her a star.<ref name="girl" /> It was Hornblow who changed her name to Veronica Lake. According to him, her eyes, "calm and clear like a blue lake", were the deciding factor in her new name.<ref>{{cite journal title=Veronica Lake is Paramounts Bid for Years Best Glamor Starlet journal=LIFE date=March 3, 1941 volume=10 issue=9 page=83 url=https://books.google.com/?id=IUoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82&dq=Constance+Keane+%22veronica+lake%22#v=onepage&q=Constance%20Keane%20%22veronica%20lake%22&f=false access-date=August 7, 2017 publisher=Time Inc language=en}}</ref>

===Stardom===

It was during the filming of I Wanted Wings that Lake developed her signature look. Lakes long blonde hair accidentally fell over her right eye during a take and created a "peek-a-boo" effect. "I was playing a sympathetic drunk, I had my arm on a table&nbsp;... it slipped&nbsp;... and my hair&nbsp;— it was always baby fine and had this natural break&nbsp;— fell over my face&nbsp;... It became my trademark and purely by accident", she recalled.<ref name="gale" />

I Wanted Wings was a big hit, The hairstyle became Lakes trademark and was widely copied by women.<ref name=victoria>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&dat=19730708&id=zb4bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WFoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5468,1042862 title=Peek-a-Boo Star Veronica Lake Hepatitis Victim date=July 8, 1973 newspaper=The Victoria Advocate page=6-A access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref>

Even before the film came out, Lake was dubbed "the find of 1941".<ref name="girl">{{cite news date=February 23, 1941 title=Cinderell Girl of 41 newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune page=3}}</ref> However Lake did not think this meant she would have a long career and maintained her goal was to be a surgeon.

She had been six months pregnant when filming began.

Paramount put her in a thriller, This Gun for Hire (1942); her love interest was Robert Preston, but she shared more scenes with Alan Ladd and the two of them would be so popular together they would be reteamed in lead roles for three more films.<ref name=deseret>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&dat=19480303&id=ASgcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-lcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6715,318905 title=Ladd, Lake Together In Saigon date=March 3, 1948 newspaper=The Deseret News page=13 access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> Both had cameos in Star Spangled Rhythm (1942), an all-star Paramount movie.

She was meant to be reunited with McCrea in another comedy, I Married a Witch, (also 1942) produced by Sturges, and directed by René Clair, but McCrea refused to act with her again, reportedly saying "Lifes too short for two films with Veronica Lake".<ref>Robert Osborne, Turner Classic Movies, October 6, 2010</ref> Production was delayed, enabling Lake to be reunited with Ladd in The Glass Key (1942 film) The Glass Key (again 1942), replacing Patricia Morison. The male lead in I Married a Witch was eventually played by Fredric March and the resulting movie, like The Glass Key, was successful at the box-office. René Clair, the director of I Married a Witch, said of Lake "She was a very gifted girl, but she didnt believe she was gifted."<ref>{{harv Terkel 1999 p=168}}</ref>

Lake was meant to co-star with Charles Boyer in Hong Kong for Arthur Hornblow, but it was not made.<ref>{{cite news title=Of Local Origin newspaper=New York Times date=October 24, 1941 page=27}}</ref> She received acclaim for her part as a suicidal nurse in So Proudly We Hail!

Although popular with the public, Lake had a complex personality and acquired a reputation for being difficult to work with. Eddie Bracken, her co-star in Star Spangled Rhythm, in which Lake appeared in a musical number, was quoted as saying, "She was known as The Bitch and she deserved the title."<ref>{{harv Donnelley 2003 p=392}}</ref><ref>{{harv Parish Pitts 2003 p=480}}</ref> However, Lake and McCrea did make another film together, the 1947 production Ramrod. During filming of The Blue Dahlia (1946), screenwriter Raymond Chandler referred to her as "Moronica Lake".<ref>{{harv Hiney 1999 p=154}}</ref>

During World War II, Lake changed her trademark peek-a-boo hairstyle at the urging of the government to encourage women working in war industry factories to adopt more practical, safer hairstyles.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-10-12-veronica-lake_x.htm title=Veronica Lakes remains resurface date=October 12, 2004 website=usatoday.com access-date=June 2, 2008}}</ref> Although the change helped to decrease accidents involving women getting their hair caught in machinery, doing so may have damaged Lakes career.<ref name="starr2003">{{harv Starr 2003 pp=128–29}}</ref><ref name=brenner>{{cite news last=Brenner first=John Lanouette url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&dat=19670826&id=9K0rAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kf0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=7213,5706895 title=Veronica Lake Gives Telegraph Exclusive Personal Interview date=August 26, 1967 newspaper=The Telegraph page=9 access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> She also became a popular Pin-up model  pin-up girl for soldiers during World War II and traveled throughout the United States to raise money for war bonds.<ref name=brenner />

==Later career==
In June 1944, Lake appeared at a war bond drive in Boston, where her services as a dishwasher were auctioned off. She also performed in a revue, with papers saying her "talk was on the grim side".<ref>{{cite news title=Tobin Shines As Butler At Bond Lunch: $100,000 Luncheon Served at Tobin Home newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor location=Boston date=June 13, 1944 page=1}}</ref> Hedda Hopper later claimed this appearance was responsible for Paramount giving her the third lead in Out of This World (1945 film) Out of This World, supporting Diana Lynn, saying "Lake clipped her own wings in her Boston bond appearance ...

Lakes career faltered with her unsympathetic role as Nazism Nazi spy Dora Bruckman in The Hour Before the Dawn (1944). Scathing reviews of The Hour Before the Dawn included criticism of her unconvincing German accent.{{citation needed date=November 2016}} She had begun drinking more heavily during this period, and a growing number of people refused to work with her. Lake had a number of months off work, during which time she lost a child and was divorced. She was brought back in Bring On the Girls (film) Bring On the Girls (1945), Lakes first proper musical, although she had sung in This Gun for Hire and Star Spangled Rhythm. There were two more movies with Bracken, Out of This World (1945 film) Out of This World and Hold That Blonde, both also 1945.

File:Lake-ladd-trailer.jpg thumb left 222px Lake and Alan Ladd in trailer for The Blue Dahlia (1946)
Lake then made two films produced by John Houseman, Miss Susie Slagles and The Blue Dahlia (both 1946). While waiting for the films to be released in 1945, she took stock of her career, claiming, "I had to learn about acting. Ive played all sorts of parts, taken just what came along regardless of high merit. In fact, Ive been a sort of general utility person. I havent liked all the roles. One or two were pretty bad".<ref name="edwin" />

One role Lake really liked was Hold That Blonde (1945), supporting Eddie Bracken (in a part turned down by Bob Hope). "Its a comedy, rather like what Carole Lombard used to do ... It represents a real change of pace".<ref name="edwin">{{cite news last=Schallert first=Edwin date=July 8, 1945 page=C1 title=Change of Pace in Roles Beckons Veronica Lake: Star to Pause at Careers Crossroads Roles to Shift for Veronica work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> She thought she had a good part in The Blue Dahlia.<ref name="edwin" />

Lake expressed interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:<blockquote>The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated they are going to fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think Ill enjoy being fussed about&nbsp;... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. Ive had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves havent been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think theyve all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I dont believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.<ref name="edwin" /></blockquote>

She made her first film outside Paramount since she became a star, a Western, Ramrod (film) Ramrod (1947), directed by her then-husband Andre DeToth, which reunited her with Joel McCrea, despite his earlier reservation. Back at her home studio she had a cameo in Variety Girl (1947) then was united with Ladd for the last time in Saigon (1948 film) Saigon (1948), in which she returned to her former peek-a-boo hairstyle; the movie was not particularly well received. Neither was a romantic drama, Isnt It Romantic? (1948 film) Isnt It Romantic (also 1948) or a comedy The Sainted Sisters (1948). In 1948 Paramount decided not to renew Lakes contract. {{citation needed date=March 2016}}

===Leaving Paramount===
Lake moved to 20th Century Fox to make Slatterys Hurricane (1949), directed by DeToth. It was only a support role and there were not many other offers. In 1950 it was announced she and DeToth would make Before I Wake (from a suspense novel by Mel Devrett) and Flanagan Boy.<ref>{{cite news title=Drama: DArrast, Glazer Plan Spanish Feature; Power Debates British Stage last=Schallert first=Edwin newspaper=Los Angeles Times date=March 11, 1950 page=11}}</ref> Neither was made.

===New York===

In the summer of 1951, she was fed up; two marriages had failed, and she was typecast in Hollywood as a sex symbol. As a result of her disillusionment with Hollywood and not liking what it did with people, she walked out on Hollywood, took her three children, and headed to New York to restart her career. Lake wanted to leave her sexy image behind, and New York offered the opportunity to work in theater and the new medium, television.

<blockquote>"They said, Shell be back in a couple of months, recalled Lake. "Well I never returned. Enough was enough already. Did I want to be one of the walking dead or a real person?"<ref name="gale" /></blockquote>

After her third divorce, Lake drifted between cheap hotels in New York City, and was arrested several times for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct.

Bain quoted Lake, looking back at her career, as saying, "I never did Pin-up model cheesecake like Ann Sheridan or Betty Grable. I just used my hair".
