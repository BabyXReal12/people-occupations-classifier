Michael Dorn (born December 9, 1952) is an American actor and voice artist who is known for his role as the Klingon Worf in the Star Trek franchise.

From his first appearance in the series premiere episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, "Encounter at Farpoint", to his last in Star Trek: Nemesis, Dorn has appeared more times as a regular cast member than any other Star Trek actor in the franchises history, spanning five films and 272 television episodes. He also appeared as Worfs ancestor, Colonel Worf, in the film Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.

Following the end of his Star Trek career, Dorn had supporting roles in a number of independent feature films, including Shadow Hours (2000), Lessons for an Assassin (2001), and The Santa Clause (film series) the Santa Clause trilogy, in which he appeared in a cameo role as "The Sandman".

==Early life==
Dorn was born in Luling, Texas, the son of Allie Lee (née Nauls) and Fentress Dorn, Jr.<ref>{{cite web url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/celeb/dorn.htm  title=Michael Dorn Family Tree  publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com  date=  accessdate=2010-08-17}}</ref> He grew up in Pasadena, California. He studied radio and television production at Pasadena City College. From there he pursued a career in music as a performer with several different rock music bands, traveling to San Francisco and then back to Los Angeles.

==Career==

===Early work===
Dorn first appeared in Rocky (1976) as Apollo Creeds bodyguard, though he was not credited.<ref name=Trek>{{cite web  url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/dorn  title=Star Trek Database – Dorn, Michael  work=Star Trek Database  publisher=CBS Entertainment  accessdate=December 10, 2011}}</ref> He also appeared as a guest on the television show W.E.B. in 1978. The producer was impressed with his work, so he introduced Dorn to an agent who then introduced him to acting teacher Charles Conrad to study acting for six months. He then landed a regular role on the television series CHiPs.<ref name=Trek/>

Dorns most famous role to date is that of the Klingon Starfleet officer Lieutenant (later Lt. Commander) Worf in Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.

"If what happened to the first cast is called being typecast," Dorn says, "then I want to be typecast. Of course, they didnt get the jobs after Trek. But they are making their sixth movie. Name me someone else in television who has made six movies!"<ref name="teitelbaum19910505">{{cite news url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1991-05-05/magazine/tm-2100_1_star-trek  archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ybc7Wqbr?url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1991-05-05/magazine/tm-2100_1_star-trek  archivedate=May 11, 2011  title=How Gene Roddenberry and his Brain Trust Have Boldly Taken Star Trek Where No TV Series Has Gone Before : Trekking to the Top  work=Los Angeles Times  publisher=Tribune Company  date=May 5, 1991  pages=16  accessdate=April 27, 2011  author=Teitelbaum, Sheldon  deadurl=yes  df= }}</ref>

Dorn has appeared on-screen in more Star Trek episodes and movies as the same character than anyone else: he appeared in 175 episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation (missing only the episodes "Code of Honor (Star Trek: The Next Generation) Code of Honor", "Haven (Star Trek: The Next Generation) Haven", and "Shades of Gray (Star Trek: The Next Generation) Shades of Gray"), 102 episodes of Deep Space Nine and four Star Trek movies, bringing his total to 281 appearances as Worf. Dorn is also one of six actors to lend his voice to Star Trek: Captains Chair, reprising his role of Lieutenant Commander Worf.

Dorns appearance in the film Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country was as Colonel Worf, representing Captain James T. Kirk and Dr. Leonard McCoy at their trial on QonoS and also unmasking the real assassin, Colonel West.

Dorn directed the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes "In the Cards", "Inquisition (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine) Inquisition" and "When It Rains...", and the Star Trek: Enterprise episode "Two Days and Two Nights".

In 2012, Dorn announced a desire to return to his Klingon role in a television series tentatively titled Star Trek: Captain Worf. He said: <blockquote>I had come up with the idea because I love [Worf] and I think hes a character that hasnt been fully developed and hasnt been fully realized. Once I started thinking about it, it became obvious to me that I wanted to at least put it out there, which I have, and the response has been pretty amazing. Weve been contacted by different individuals–I cant say who and all that–about wanting to come on board and be part of this.<ref>{{cite web last=Schaefer first=Sandy url=http://screenrant.com/star-trek-captain-worf-tv-show-michael-dorn/ title=Michael Dorn Confirms Hes Working on a Star Trek: Captain Worf’ TV Series work=Screen Rant publisher=IndieClick Film Network accessdate=May 13, 2013 date=September 4, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>
