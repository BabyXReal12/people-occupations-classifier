Richard Ira Bong (September 24, 1920&nbsp;– August 6, 1945) was a United States Army Air Forces major and Medal of Honor recipient in World War II. He was one of the most decorated American fighter pilots and the countrys top flying ace in the war, credited with shooting down 40 Japanese aircraft, all with the Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter aircraft fighter. He died in California while testing a jet aircraft shortly before the war ended.

==Early life==
Bong was born in Superior, Wisconsin, the first of nine children son of Carl Bong, an immigrant of Sweden, and Dora Bryce,<!--nee?--> who was an American of Scots-English descent.<ref> [http://www.nationalaviation.org/our-enshrinees/bong-richard/ The National Aviation Hall of Fame] </ref> He grew up on a farm in Poplar, Wisconsin Poplar, Wisconsin, where he became interested in aircraft at an early age while watching planes fly over the farm carrying mail for President Calvin Coolidges summer White House in Superior,<ref> [https://www.bvhcenter.org/bong-bio/ Veterans Historical Center] </ref> and was an avid model builder. Bong entered Poplar High School in 1934, where he played the clarinet in the marching band and participated in baseball, basketball, and hockey. Because Poplar was a three-year school at the time, Bong transferred to Central High School (Superior, Wisconsin) Central High School in Superior for his senior year, graduating in 1938.{{Sfn Yenne 2009 p= pp=22–25}}

He began studying at Superior State Teachers College (the current-day University of Wisconsin–Superior) in 1938. While there, Bong enrolled in the Civilian Pilot Training Program and also took private flying lessons. On May 29, 1941, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps Army Air Corps Aviation Cadet Program. One of his flight instructors was Captain Barry Goldwater (later List of United States Senators from Arizona a U.S. Senator from Arizona).

==United States Army Air Forces==
Bongs ability as a fighter pilot was recognized while he was training in northern California. He was commissioned a second lieutenant#United States second lieutenant and awarded his pilot wings on January 19, 1942. His first assignment was as an instructor (gunnery) pilot at Luke Field, Arizona, from January to May 1942. His first operational assignment was on May 6 to the 49th Fighter Training Squadron 49th Fighter Squadron (FS), 14th Flying Training Wing 14th Fighter Group at Hamilton Air Force Base Hamilton Field, California, where he learned to fly the twin-engine Lockheed P-38 Lightning.

On June 12, 1942, Bong flew very low ("buzzed") over a house in nearby San Anselmo, California San Anselmo, the home of a pilot who had just been married. He was cited and temporarily grounded for breaking flying rules, along with three other P-38 pilots who had looped around the Golden Gate Bridge on the same day.<ref>Dear Mom, So We Have a War (1991)</ref> For looping the Golden Gate Bridge, flying at a low level down Market Street in San Francisco, and blowing the clothes off of an Oakland womans clothesline, Bong was reprimanded by George Kenney General George C. Kenney, commanding officer of the Fourth Air Force, who told him, "If you didnt want to fly down Market Street, I wouldnt have you in my Air Force, but you are not to do it any more and I mean what I say." Kenney later wrote, "We needed kids like this lad."<ref>{{Cite book url = https://www.google.com/books?id=tWdbngbCc84C first = George C. last = Kenney authorlink = George Kenney title = General Kenney Reports: A Personal History of the Pacific War publisher = Duell, Sloan and Pearce location = New York City year = 1949 pages = 3–6}}</ref> In all subsequent accounts, Bong denied flying under the Golden Gate Bridge.{{sfn Yenne 2009 p=68}} Nevertheless, Bong was still grounded when the rest of his group was sent without him to England in July 1942. Bong then transferred to another Hamilton Field unit, 84th Flying Training Squadron 84th Fighter Squadron of the 78th Air Base Wing 78th Fighter Group. From there, Bong was sent to the South West Pacific theatre of World War II Southwest Pacific Area.

On September 10, 1942, Lt. Bong was assigned to the 9th Fighter Squadron, which was flying Curtis P-40 Warhawk P-40 Warhawks, based at Darwin, Australia. In November, while the squadron waited for delivery of the scarce P-38s, Bong and other 9th FS pilots were reassigned temporarily to fly missions and gain combat experience with the 39th Fighter Squadron, 35th Fighter Group, based in Port Moresby, New Guinea. On December 27, Bong claimed his initial aerial victory, shooting down a A6M Zero Mitsubishi A6M "Zero", and a Nakajima Ki-43 Nakajima Ki-43 "Oscar" over Buna (during the Battle of Buna-Gona).<ref>[http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=2681 Military Ties-Hall of Valor, Richard Bong, Silver Star citation]</ref> For this action, Bong was awarded the Silver Star.

Bong rejoined the 9th FS, by then equipped with P-38s, in January 1943; the 49th FG was based at Schwimmer Airfield Schwimmer Field near Port Moresby. In April, he was promoted to first lieutenant.<ref name="af.mil">{{cite web url=http://www.afhistory.af.mil/FAQs/Fact-Sheets/Article/639628/bong-maj-richard-ira-bong/ title=Factsheets : Maj Richard Ira Bong last= first= date=November 26, 2014 work=Air Force Historical Support Division accessdate=February 1, 2016}}</ref> On July 26, Bong claimed four Japanese fighters over Lae, in an action that earned him the Distinguished Service Cross (United States) Distinguished Service Cross. In August, he was promoted to captain.<ref name="af.mil"/>

While on leave to the United States the following November and December, Bong met Marjorie Vattendahl at a Superior State Teachers College homecoming event and began dating her.

After returning to the southwest Pacific in January 1944, he named his P-38 "Marge" and adorned the nose with her photo.<ref>Dick Bong Americas Ace of Aces by Gen. George C. Kenney.</ref> On April 12, Captain Bong shot down his 26th and 27th Japanese aircraft, surpassing Eddie Rickenbackers American record of 26 credited victories in World War I. Soon afterwards, he was promoted to major by George Kenney General George Kenney and dispatched to the United States to see General Arnold, who gave him a leave.<ref name="HistoryNet">{{Cite web url=http://www.historynet.com/richard-ira-bong-american-world-war-ii-ace-of-aces.htm title=Richard Ira Bong: American World War II Ace of Aces last=Guttman first=Jon date=November 7, 2016 website=HistoryNet.com language=en-US access-date=August 23, 2017}}</ref><ref name="af.mil"/> After visiting training bases and going on a 15-state bond promotion tour, Bong returned to New Guinea in September. He was assigned to the V Fighter Command staff as an advanced gunnery instructor with permission to go on missions but not to seek combat.<ref name="HistoryNet"/> Bong continued flying from Tacloban, Leyte, during the Philippines campaign (1944–45) Philippines campaign; by December 17, he had increased his air-to-air victory claims to 40.

Bong considered his gunnery accuracy to be poor, so he compensated by getting as close to his targets as possible to make sure he hit them. In some cases he flew through the debris of exploding enemy aircraft, and on one occasion collided with his target, which he claimed as a "probable" victory.

On the recommendation of General Kenney, the Far East Air Force (United States) Far East Air Force commander, Bong received the Medal of Honor from General Douglas MacArthur in a special ceremony in December 1944. Bongs Medal of Honor citation says that he flew combat missions despite his status as an instructor, which was one of his duties as standardization officer for V Fighter Command. His rank of major would have qualified him for a squadron command, but he always flew as a flight (four-plane) or element (two-plane) leader.

In January 1945, Kenney sent Americas List of aces of aces ace of aces home for good. Bong married Vattendahl on February 10, 1945.<ref>Elaine Woo. "[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/10/local/me-drucker10 Marjorie Drucker, 79; Wife of World War II Ace Richard Bong]". Los Angeles Times, October 10, 2003.</ref> He participated in numerous Public relations PR activities, such as promoting the sale of war bonds.

==Death==
File:Lockheed P-80 PN-155.jpg thumb Bong was killed in 1945 while testing a P-80 Shooting Star P-80A similar to this one.
File:1945-08-07-Los-Angeles-Times-front-page.jpg thumb upright His death was featured prominently in national newspapers, even though it occurred on the same day as the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

Bong then became a test pilot assigned to Lockheed Corporation Lockheeds Burbank, California, plant, where he flew P-80 Shooting Star fighter aircraft jet fighters at the Bob Hope Airport Lockheed Air Terminal.  On August 6, 1945, the planes primary fuel pump malfunctioned during takeoff on the acceptance flight of P-80A 44-85048. Bong either forgot to switch to the auxiliary fuel pump, or for some reason was unable to do so.<ref name="yeagerbio">Chuck Yeager Yeager, Chuck and Leo Janos Janos, Leo. Yeager: An Autobiography. Pages 227–228 (paperback). New York: Bantam Books, 1986. {{ISBN 0-553-25674-2}}.</ref> Bong cleared away from the aircraft, but was too low for his parachute to deploy. The plane crashed into a narrow field at Oxnard St & Satsuma Ave, North Hollywood. His death was front-page news across the country, sharing space with the first news of the bombing of Hiroshima.<ref>The New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times, among other periodicals, all carried prominent front page stories about Bongs death on August 7, 1945, despite the prevalence of the news on the first atomic bombing. "Jet plane explosion kills Major Bong, Top U.S. Ace," New York Times (August 7, 1945), p. 1; "Major Bong, top air ace, killed in crash of Army P-80 jet-fighter," Washington Post (August 6, 1945), p.1; "Jet plane explosion kills Maj. Bong; Aces Shooting Star blows up in test flight over north Hollywood", Los Angeles Times (August 6, 1945), p.1.</ref>

At the time of the crash, Bong had accumulated four hours and fifteen minutes of flight time (totaling 12 flights) in the P-80. The I-16 fuel pump was a later addition to the plane (after an earlier fatal crash) and Bong himself was quoted by Captain Ray Crawford (another P-80 test/acceptance flight pilot who flew the day Bong was killed) as saying that he had forgotten to turn on the I-16 pump on an earlier flight.<ref>Dear Mom, So We Have a War (1991)</ref>

In his autobiography, Chuck Yeager also writes, however, that part of the ingrained culture of test flying at the time, due to the fearsome mortality rates of the pilots, was anger directed at pilots who died in test flights, to avoid being overcome by sorrow for lost comrades. Bongs brother Carl (who wrote his biography) questions the validity of reported circumstance that Bong repeated the same mistake so soon after mentioning it to another pilot. Carls book—Dear Mom, So We Have a War (1991)—contains numerous reports and findings from the crash investigations.

Major Richard Ira Bong is buried at Poplar  Cemetery in Poplar, Wisconsin.<ref name=findagrave>{{Find a Grave 2375 work=Claim to Fame: Medal of Honor recipients accessdate=December 9, 2007}}</ref>
