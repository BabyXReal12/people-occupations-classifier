Gabriella (Gaby) Angelini (1911 - 3 December 1932) was an Italian aviator.
Angelini was born in Milan to a wealthy family. She earned her pilots license at the age of 19, and quickly became a popular figure in Italy.
She was the first Italian woman to complete a trans-European flight, travelling to eight European countries, for which she received a Golden Eagle Medal. In 1932 she left Italy on a solo flight to Delhi, India, travelling in a Breda Ba.15 aeroplane. Angelini encountered difficulties during a sandstorm in Libya en route, and crashed in the desert and died.
More than 120,000 people attended her funeral in Milan.
In 2014 a book was published about Angelinis life, titled La Legendda di Little Gaby (The Legend of Little Gaby).
