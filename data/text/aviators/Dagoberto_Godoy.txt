In mid-1918 Chile received twelve Bristol M.1c aircraft from Britain. Major Victor Huston, a British flying ace, also arrived to assist in training the Chileans. In December Godoy, encouraged by Huston, obtained permission of the head of air service, Pedro Dartnell, to attempt a crossing the Andes, taking advantage of the Bristols superior performance to any aircraft they previously had.<ref name="MCN"/>

On 12 December 1918, flying Bristol M.1c C4988, Godoy took off from the airfield of El Bosque, Chile El Bosque, and flew past Tupungato, through the mountain passes of Paso Internacional Los Libertadores Cristo Redentor and Uspallata Pass Uspallata, passing close to the summit of Aconcagua, before landing in a field in Lagunitas, close to Mendoza, Argentina. Unfortunately he crashed into a fence, damaging his landing gear, propeller and starboard wing, and hitting his head on the dashboard, receiving a slight concussion. The flight had lasted 90 minutes at a speed of {{Convert 180 - 190 kph}}, at a maximum altitude of {{Convert 6300 m}} and was made in an open-cockpit aircraft without heating or oxygen. Godoy eventually returned to Chile to public acclaim, and was promoted to captain.<ref name="MCN"/><ref>{{cite journal  url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1918/1918%20-%201462.html  title=Flight over the Andes  issue=521  volume=X  page=1431  journal=Flight International Flight  date=19 December 1918  accessdate=7 May 2016}}</ref> His feat encouraged others, with Lieutenant Armando Cortinez Mújica flying another Bristol to Argentina and back on 5 April 1919, and the same year Sergeant Jose del Carmen Ojeda established the first South American altitude record of {{Convert 7188 m}}.<ref name="MCN"/>
