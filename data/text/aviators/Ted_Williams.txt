Theodore Samuel "Ted" Williams (August 30, 1918 – July 5, 2002) was an Mexican-American American professional baseball player and manager (baseball) manager. He played his entire 19-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career as a left fielder for the Boston Red Sox from 1939 to 1960, only interrupted by service time during World War II and the Korean War. Nicknamed "The Kid", "The Splendid Splinter", "Teddy Ballgame", "The Thumper", and "The Greatest Hitter Who Ever Lived", Williams is regarded as one of the greatest players in baseball history, despite being a below average defensive left fielder.
Williams was a nineteen-time Major League Baseball All-Star Game All-Star,<ref>Sportsdata.

He finished his playing career with a .344 batting average, 521 home runs, and a .482 on-base percentage, the highest of all time. His career batting average is the highest of any MLB player whose career was played primarily in the live-ball era, and ranks tied for 7th all-time (with Billy Hamilton (baseball, born 1866) Billy Hamilton).

Born and raised in San Diego, Williams played baseball throughout his youth. Joining the Red Sox in 1939, he immediately emerged as one of the sports best hitters. In 1941, Williams posted a .406 batting average, making him the last List of Major League Baseball players with a .400 batting average in a season MLB player to bat over .400 in a season. He followed this up by winning his first Triple Crown in 1942. Williams interrupted his baseball career in 1943 to serve three years in the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps Marine Corps during World War II. Upon returning to MLB in 1946, Williams won his first AL MVP Award and played in his only World Series. In 1947, he won his second Triple Crown. Williams was returned to active military duty for portions of the 1952 and 1953 seasons to serve as a Marine combat aviator in the Korean War. In 1957 and 1958 at the ages of 39 and 40, respectively, he was the AL batting champion for the fifth and sixth time.

==Early life==
Williams was born Theodore Samuel Williams (after former President Theodore Roosevelt and his father, Samuel Stuart Williams<ref name="Montville19">{{harvp Montville 2004 p=19}}</ref>) in San Diego on August 30, 1918.<ref>Seidel, p. 1</ref> At some later date he amended his birth certificate, removing his middle name,<ref name="Montville19"/> which he claimed originated from a maternal uncle (whose actual name was Daniel Venzor), who had been killed in World War I.<ref>Williams & Underwood, p. 31</ref>  His father was a soldier, sheriff, and photographer from New York (state) New York,<ref>Williams & Underwood, p. 30</ref> while his mother, May Venzor, a Mexican-American from El Paso, Texas, was an evangelist and lifelong soldier in the Salvation Army.<ref name="Montville19"/> Williams resented his mothers long hours working in the Salvation Army,<ref>Seidel, p. 4</ref> and Williams and his brother cringed when she took them to the Armys street-corner revivals.<ref>{{harvp Montville 2004 p=21}}</ref>

Williams paternal ancestors were a mix of Welsh people Welsh and Irish people Irish. The maternal, Mexican side of Williams family was quite diverse, having Spanish people Spanish (Basque people Basque), Russians Russian, and Indigenous peoples of the Americas American Indian roots.<ref>Nowlin, p. 324</ref> Of his Mexican ancestry he said that "If I had my mothers name, there is no doubt I would have run into problems in those days, [considering] the prejudices people had in Southern California".<ref name="Williams28">Williams & Underwood, p. 28</ref>

Williams lived in San Diegos North Park neighborhood (4121 Utah Street).<ref>{{harvp Montville 2004 p=20}}</ref> At the age of eight, he was taught how to throw a baseball by his uncle, Saul Venzor. Saul was one of his mothers four brothers, as well as a former semi-professional baseball player who had pitched against Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Joe Gordon in an exhibition game.<ref>Nowlin & Price, p. 31</ref><ref>{{harvp Montville 2004 p=22}}</ref> As a child, Williams heroes were Pepper Martin of the St. Louis Cardinals and Bill Terry of the History of the New York Giants (NL) New York Giants.<ref>McCormack, p. 14</ref> Williams graduated from Herbert Hoover High School (San Diego) Herbert Hoover High School in San Diego, where he played baseball as a pitcher and was the star of the team.<ref>{{harvp Montville 2004 p=26}}</ref> During this time, he also played American Legion Baseball, later being named the 1960 American Legion Baseball Graduate of the Year. <ref>https://www.legion.org/baseball/alumni/ted-williams</ref>

Though he had offers from the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Yankees while he was still in high school,<ref>Nowlin, p. 118</ref> his mother thought he was too young to leave home, so he signed up with the local minor league club, the San Diego Padres (PCL) San Diego Padres.<ref>{{cite web url=http://espn.go.com/classic/obit/williams_ted_obit.html title=There goes the greatest hitter who ever lived work=ESPN Classic date=July 8, 2002 last=Meserole first=Mike accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>

Throughout his career, Williams stated his goal was to have people point to him and remark, "There goes Ted Williams, the greatest hitter who ever lived."<ref>Williams & Underwood, p. 7</ref>

===Minor leagues (1936–1938)===
Williams played back-up behind Vince DiMaggio and Ivey Shiver on the (then) Pacific Coast League San Diego Padres (PCL) San Diego Padres. While in the Pacific Coast League in 1936, Williams met future teammates and friends Dom DiMaggio and Bobby Doerr, who were on the Pacific Coast Leagues San Francisco Seals (baseball) San Francisco Seals.<ref>Montville, p. 32</ref> When Shiver announced he was quitting to become a football coach at the University of Georgia, the job, by default, was open for Williams.<ref name="Montville33-34">Montville, p. 33-34</ref> Williams posted a .271 batting average on 107 at bats in 42 games for the Padres in 1936.<ref name="Montville33-34"/> Unknown to Williams, he had caught the eye of the Boston Red Soxs general manager, Eddie Collins, while Collins was scouting Bobby Doerr and the shortstop George Myatt in August 1936.<ref name="Montville33-34"/><ref>Nowlin, p. 98</ref> Collins later explained, "It wasnt hard to find Ted Williams. He stood out like a brown cow in a field of white cows."<ref name="Montville33-34"/> In the 1937 season, after graduating from Hoover High in the winter, Williams finally broke into the line-up on June 22, when he hit an inside-the-park home run to help the Padres win 3-2. The Padres ended up winning the PCL title, while Williams ended up hitting .291 with 23 home runs.<ref name="Montville33-34"/> Meanwhile, Collins kept in touch with Padres general manager Bill Lane, calling him two times throughout the season. In December 1937, during the winter meetings, the deal was made between Lane and Collins, sending Williams to the Boston Red Sox and giving Lane $35,000 and two major leaguers, Dom DAllessandro and Al Niemiec, and two other minor leaguers.<ref>Nowlin, p. 100</ref><ref>Williams & Underwood, p. 43</ref>

In 1938, the 19-year-old Williams was 10 days late to spring training camp in Sarasota, Florida, because of a flood in California blocking the railroads. Williams had to borrow $200 from a bank to make the trip from San Diego to Sarasota.<ref name="Williams45">Williams & Underwood, p. 45</ref> Also during spring training Williams was nicknamed "The Kid" by Red Sox equipment manager Johnny Orlando, who after Williams arrived to Sarasota for the first time, said, "{{}}The Kid has arrived". Orlando still called Williams "The Kid" 20 years later,<ref name="Williams45"/> and the nickname stuck with Williams the rest of his life.<ref>Reis, p. 14</ref> Williams remained in major league spring training for about a week.<ref name="Williams45"/> Williams was then sent to the Double-A (baseball) Double-A-league Minneapolis Millers.<ref name="Montville46">Montville, p. 46</ref> While in the Millers training camp for the springtime, Williams met Rogers Hornsby, who had hit over .400 three times, including a .424 average in 1924,<ref name="Montville45">Montville, p. 45</ref>. Hornsby was a coach for the Millers for the spring.<ref name="Montville45"/> Hornsby told Williams useful advice, including to "get a good pitch to hit".<ref name="Montville46"/> Talking with the games greats would become a pattern for Williams, who talked with Hugh Duffy who hit .438 in 1894, Bill Terry who hit .401 in 1930, and Ty Cobb against whom he would argue that a batter (baseball) batter should hit up on the ball, opposed to Cobbs view that a batter should hit down on the ball.<ref>Montville, p. 47</ref>

While in Minnesota, Williams quickly became the teams star.<ref name="Montville48-49">Montville, p. 48-49</ref> He collected his first hit in the Millers first game of the season, as well as his first and second home runs during his third game. Both were inside-the-park home runs, with the second traveling an estimated five-hundred feet on the fly to a five-hundred and twelve foot center fielder center field fence.<ref name="Montville48-49"/> Williams later had a 22 game hitting streak that lasted from Memorial Day through mid-June.<ref name="Montville48-49"/> While the Millers ended up sixth place in an eight-team race,<ref name="Montville48-49"/> Williams ended up hitting .366 with 46 home runs and 142 RBIs.

Williams 1941 season is often considered to be the best offensive season of all time, though the MVP award would go to DiMaggio. The .406 batting average—his first of six batting championships—is still the highest single-season average in Red Sox history and the highest batting average in the major leagues since 1924, and the last time any major league player has hit over .400 for a season after averaging at least 3.1 plate appearances per game.  ("If I had known hitting .400 was going to be such a big deal", he quipped in 1991, "I would have done it again."<ref name = "NYT.406"/>) Williams on-base percentage of .553 and slugging percentage of .735 that season are both also the highest single-season averages in Red Sox history. The .553 OBP stood as a major league record until it was broken by Barry Bonds in 2002 and his .735 slugging percentage was the highest mark in the major leagues between 1932 and 1994. His On-base plus slugging OPS of 1.287 that year, a Red Sox record, was the highest in the major leagues between 1923 and 2001. Despite playing in only 143 games that year, Williams led the league with 135 runs scored and 37 home runs, and he finished third with 335 total bases, the most home runs, runs scored, and total bases by a Red Sox player since Jimmie Foxxs in 1938.<ref name="baseball-reference.com">[https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/BOS/leaders_bat_50.shtml Boston Red Sox Top 50 Batting Leaders] Baseball-Reference</ref> Williams placed second in MVP voting; DiMaggio won, 291 votes to 254,<ref>Linn, p. 168</ref> on the strength of his record-breaking 56-game hitting streak and league-leading 125 RBI.<ref name="Williams96"/>

===U.S. Marine Corps, Korea (1952–1953)===

Williams name was called from a list of inactive reserves to serve on active duty in the Korean War on January 9, 1952.

====1956–1960====
On July 17, {{mlby 1956}}, Williams became the fifth player to hit 400 home runs, following Mel Ott in 1941, Jimmie Foxx in 1938, Lou Gehrig in 1936, and Babe Ruth in 1927.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=willite01&t=b&year=1956 Ted Williams 1956 Batting Gamelogs] Baseball-Reference</ref><ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/willite01.shtml Ted Williams Statistics and History] Baseball-Reference</ref> On August 7, {{mlby 1956}}, after Williams was booed for dropping a fly ball from Mickey Mantle, Williams spat at one of the fans that was taunting him on the top of the dugout.<ref>Montville, p. 197-198</ref> Williams was fined $5,000 for the incident.<ref>Montville, p. 198</ref> The next day against Baltimore, Williams was greeted by a large ovation, and received an even larger ovation when he hit a home run in the sixth inning to break a 2 – 2 tie.

Williams explained years later, "From 56 on, I realized that people were for me. The writers had written that the fans should show me they didnt want me, and I got the biggest ovation yet".<ref>Montville, p. 199</ref> Williams lost the batting title to Mickey Mantle in 1956, batting .345 to Mantles .353, with Mantle on his way to winning the Triple Crown.<ref>Williams & Underwood, p. 197</ref>

In {{mlby 1957}}, Williams batted .388 to lead the Major Leagues, and at the age of 40 in 1958, he led the American League with a .328 batting average.

When Pumpsie Green became the first black player on the Boston Red Sox in 1959—the last major league team to integrate its team—Williams openly welcomed Green.

Williams ended his career, hitting a home run in his very last at-bat on September 28, {{mlby 1960}}. An  essay written by John Updike the following month for The New Yorker, "Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu", chronicles this event.<ref>{{cite journal url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1960/10/22/hub-fans-bid-kid-adieu title=Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu last=Updike first=John journal=The New Yorker date=October 22, 1960}}</ref>

Williams is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League games in four decades. He is also one of only four players to hit a home run in each of four different decades, the others being Willie McCovey (who, like Williams, also retired with 521 career home runs), Rickey Henderson and Omar Vizquel.

===Playing style===
Williams was an obsessive student of hitting. He famously used a lighter bat than most sluggers, because it generated a faster swing. David Halberstams Summer of 49 recalls him warning teammates not to leave their bats on the ground as they would absorb moisture and become heavier. His biographer Leigh Montville relates the often told story that Hillerich & Bradsby presented Williams with four bats weighing 34 ounces and one weighing 33 1/2 ounces, and challenged him to identify the lighter bat, which he was consistently able to do. His devotion allowed him to hit for power and average while maintaining extraordinary plate discipline. In 1970 he wrote a book on the subject, The Science of Hitting (revised 1986), which is still read by many baseball players. Williams was known to discuss hitting with active players enthusiastically until very late in his life. A conversation with Tony Gwynn was filmed for television.

Williams nearly always took the first pitch, reasoning that the ability to gauge the pitchers "stuff" was worth conceding a first strike. He was occasionally criticized for refusing to swing at a borderline pitch to put a ball in play when it might have helped advance a runner or score a run (a recurring theme among sportswriter critics was that "Ted plays for himself."). Yet, Williams argued persuasively about the great advantage that accrues to pitchers when hitters swing at a pitch even one baseball width outside the strike zone. In a graphic from 1968 that accompanied an article in Sports Illustrated magazine, Williams divided the strike zone into 77 baseballs, with each baseball containing his projected batting average for pitches thrown in that location.

Williams was frequently critical of pitchers and their refusal to bring the related kind of strategic thinking to their pitch selection that he brought to hitting. However, he did show great respect for Red Sox pitcher Bill Lee (left-handed pitcher) Bill "Spaceman" Lee, crediting him with that kind of mindset.  Pitchers apparently feared Williams; he still has the highest walk-to-at-bat ratio (.2623) of any player in the Hall of Fame. 

Williams lacked foot speed, as attested by his 19-year career total of only one inside-the-park home run, one occasion of hitting for the cycle, and just 24 stolen bases. (Despite his slowness on the basepaths, he is one of only four players in history – along with the noted speedsters Tim Raines, Rickey Henderson, and Omar Vizquel – to have stolen a base in four different decades.)  Williams always felt that if he had had more speed, he could have raised his average considerably and it would have helped him hit .400 in at least one more season. Williams was sometimes considered to be an indifferent outfielder with a good throwing arm. He often spent time in left field practicing "shadow swings" for his next at-bat. Williams occasionally expressed regret that he had not worked harder on his defense. However, Williams did become an expert at playing the rebounds of batted balls off of the left-field wall and fences in Fenway Park. Later on, he helped pass this expertise to the left-fielder Carl Yastrzemski of the Red Sox.

===Relationship with Boston media and fans===
Ted Williams was on uncomfortable terms with the Boston newspapers for nearly twenty years, as he felt they liked to discuss his personal life as much as his baseball performance. He maintained a career-long feud with SPORT (magazine) SPORT magazine due to a 1948 feature article in which the SPORT reporter included a quote from Williams mother. Insecure about his upbringing, and stubborn because of immense confidence in his own talent, Williams made up his mind that the "knights of the Press Box" were against him. After having hit for the leagues Triple Crown in 1947, Williams narrowly lost the MVP award in a vote where one midwestern newspaper writer left Williams entirely off his ten-player ballot.

He treated most of the press accordingly, as he described in his memoir, My Turn at Bat. Williams also had an uneasy relationship with the Boston fans, though he could be very cordial one-on-one. He felt at times a good deal of gratitude for their passion and their knowledge of the game. On the other hand, Williams was temperamental, high-strung, and at times tactless. In his biography, Ronald Reis relates how Williams committed two fielding miscues in a doubleheader in 1950 and was roundly booed by Boston fans. He bowed three times to various sections of Fenway Park and made an obscene gesture. When he came to bat he spit in the direction of fans near the dugout. The incident caused an avalanche of negative media reaction, and inspired sportswriter Austen Lakes famous comment that when Williams name was announced the sound was like "autumn wind moaning through an apple orchard."

Another incident occurred in 1958 in a game against the Washington Senators. Williams struck out, and as he stepped from the batters box swung his bat violently in anger. The bat slipped from his hands, was launched into the stands and struck a 60-year-old woman&nbsp;— one who turned out to be the housekeeper of the Red Sox general manager Joe Cronin. While the incident was an accident and Williams apologized to the woman personally, to all appearances it seemed at the time that Williams had hurled the bat in a fit of temper.

Williams gave generously to those in need. He was especially linked with the Jimmy Fund of the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, which provides support for childrens cancer research and treatment. Williams used his celebrity to virtually launch the fund, which raised more that $750 million between 1948 and 2010. Throughout his career, Williams made countless bedside visits to children being treated for cancer, which Williams insisted go unreported. Often, parents of sick children would learn at check-out time that "Mr. Williams has taken care of your bill."<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web url=http://www.jimmyfund.org/abo/red/tedwilliams/facts.asp title=Ted Williams publisher=}}</ref> The Fund recently stated that, "Williams would travel everywhere and anywhere, no strings or paychecks attached, to support the cause&nbsp;... His name is synonymous with our battle against all forms of cancer."<ref name=autogenerated2 />

Williams demanded loyalty from those around him. He could not forgive the fickle nature of the fans&nbsp;— booing a player for booting a ground ball, then turning around and roaring approval of the same player for hitting a home run. Despite the cheers and adulation of most of his fans, the occasional boos directed at him in Fenway Park led Williams to stop tipping his cap in acknowledgement after a home run.

Williams maintained this policy up to and including his swan song in 1960. After hitting a home run at Fenway Park, which would be his last career at-bat, Williams characteristically refused either to tip his cap as he circled the bases or to respond to prolonged cheers of "We want Ted!" from the crowd by making an appearance from the dugout. The Boston manager Pinky Higgins sent Williams to his fielding position in left field to start the ninth inning, but then immediately recalled him for his back-up Carroll Hardy, thus allowing Williams to receive one last ovation as he jogged on and off the field, but he did so without reacting to the crowd. Williams aloof attitude led the writer John Updike to observe wryly that "Gods do not answer letters."

Williams final home run did not take place during the final game of the 1960 season, but rather in the Red Soxs last home game that year. The Red Sox played three more games, but they were on the road in New York City and Williams did not appear in any of them, as it became clear that Williams final home at-bat would be the last one of his career.

In 1991 on Ted Williams Day at Fenway Park, Williams pulled a Red Sox cap from out of his jacket and tipped it to the crowd. This was the first time that he had done so since his earliest days as a player.

A Red Smith (sportswriter) Red Smith profile from 1956 describes one Boston writer trying to convince Ted Williams that first cheering and then booing a ballplayer was no different from a moviegoer applauding a "western" movie actor one day and saying the next "He stinks! Whatever gave me the idea he could act?"  Williams rejected this; when he liked a western actor like Hoot Gibson, he liked him in every picture, and would not think of booing him.

He once had a friendship with Ty Cobb, with whom he often had discussions about baseball. He often touted Rogers Hornsby as being the greatest right-handed hitter of all time. This assertion actually led to a split in the relationship between Ty Cobb and Ted Williams. Once during one of their yearly debate sessions on the greatest hitters of all-time, Williams asserted that Hornsby was one of the greatest of all-time. Cobb apparently had strong feelings about Hornsby and he threw a fit, expelling Williams from his hotel room. Their friendship effectively terminated after this altercation.<ref>Stump, Al. "Cobb: A Biography." Algonquin Books, 1994.</ref> This story was later refuted by Ted Williams himself.<ref>{{cite web last=King first=Gilber title=The Knife in Ty Cobbs Back url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/history/2011/08/the-knife-in-ty-cobbs-back/ accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref>

===World War II===
Williams served as a Naval Aviator during World War II and the Korean War. Unlike many other major league players, he did not spend all of his war-time playing on service teams.{{r bullock2004}} Williams had been classified 3-A by Selective Service prior to the war, a dependency deferment because he was his mothers sole means of financial support. When his classification was changed to 1-A following the American entry into World War II, Williams appealed to his local draft board. The draft board ruled that his draft status should not have been changed. He made a public statement that once he had built up his mothers trust fund, he intended to enlist. Even so, criticism in the media, including withdrawal of an endorsement contract by Quaker Oats, resulted in his enlistment in the U.S. Naval Reserve on May 22, 1942.

Williams did not opt for an easy assignment playing baseball for the Navy, but rather joined the V-5 program to become a Naval aviator. Williams was first sent to the Navys Preliminary Ground School at Amherst College for six months of academic instruction in various subjects including math and navigation, where he achieved a 3.85 grade point average.

Williams was talented as a pilot, and so enjoyed it that he had to be ordered by the Navy to leave training to personally accept his American League 1942 Major League Baseball Triple Crown.{{r bullock2004}} Williams Red Sox teammate, Johnny Pesky, who went into the same aviation training program, said this about Williams: "He mastered intricate problems in fifteen minutes which took the average cadet an hour, and half of the other cadets there were college grads." Pesky again described Williams acumen in the advance training, for which Pesky personally did not qualify: "I heard Ted literally tore the sleeve target to shreds with his angle dives. Hed shoot from wingovers, zooms, and barrel rolls, and after a few passes the sleeve was ribbons. At any rate, I know he broke the all-time record for hits."  Ted went to Jacksonville for a course in aerial gunnery, the combat pilots payoff test, and broke all the records in reflexes, coordination, and visual-reaction time. "From what I heard. Ted could make a plane and its six pianos (machine guns) play like a symphony orchestra", Pesky says. "From what they said, his reflexes, coordination, and visual reaction made him a built-in part of the machine."<ref>Linn, p. 246-247</ref>

Williams completed pre-flight training in Athens, Georgia, his primary training at Grissom Joint Air Reserve Base NAS Bunker Hill, Indiana, and his advanced flight training at NAS Pensacola. He received his gold United States Aviator Badge Naval Aviator wings and his commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps on May 2, 1944.

Williams served as a flight instructor at the Naval Air Station Pensacola teaching young pilots to fly the complicated F4U Corsair fighter plane. Williams was in Pearl Harbor awaiting orders to join the Fleet in the Western Pacific Ocean Western Pacific when the War in the Pacific ended. He finished the war in Hawaii, and then he was released from active duty on January 12, 1946, but he did remain in the United States Marine Corps Reserve Marine Corps Reserve.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

===Korean War===
On May 1, 1952, 14 months after his promotion to Captain (United States O-3) captain in the Marine Corps Reserve, Williams was recalled to active duty for service in the Korean War.<ref name=Fortitudine>{{cite journal last1=Aquilina first1=Robert V. title=The "Splendid Splinter" Dies at 83 journal=Fortitudine date=2003 volume=XXIX issue=4 url=http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/Fortitudine%20Vol%2029%20No%204.pdf accessdate=11 March 2015 publisher=Marine Corps Historical Center}}</ref> He had not flown any aircraft for eight years but he turned down all offers to sit out the war in comfort as a member of a service baseball team. Nevertheless, Williams was resentful of being called up, which he admitted years later, particularly regarding the Navys policy of calling up Inactive Reservists rather than members of the Active Reserve.

After eight weeks of refresher flight training and qualification in the F9F Panther jet fighter at the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, Williams was assigned to VMF-311, Marine Aircraft Group 33 (MAG-33), based at the K-3 airfield in Pohang, South Korea.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

On February 16, 1953, Williams flying as the wingman for John Glenn (later Senator) was part of a 35-plane raid against a tank and infantry training school just south of Pyongyang, North Korea. During the mission, a piece of flak knocked out his hydraulics and electrical systems, causing Williams to have to "limp" his plane back to K-13, a U.S. Air Force airfield close to the front lines. The plane burst into flames soon after he landed. For his actions of this day, he was awarded the Air Medal with Gold Stars.

Williams stayed on K-13 for several days while his plane was being repaired. Because he was so popular, GIs and airmen from all around the base came to see him and his plane. After it was repaired, Williams flew his plane back to his Marine Corps airfield.

Williams flew 39 combat missions in Korea, earning the Air Medal with two 5/16 inch star Gold Stars in lieu of second and third awards, before being withdrawn from flight status in June 1953 after a hospitalization for pneumonia. This resulted in the discovery of an inner ear infection that disqualified him from flight status.<ref>Mersky, p. 190</ref> During the Korean War, Williams also served in the same Marine Corps unit with John Glenn; the future astronaut described Williams as one of the best pilots he knew,{{r bullock2004}} while his wife Annie described him as the most profane man she ever met.<ref name="shribman20161208">{{Cite news  url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/obituaries/2016/12/08/Astronaut-Ohio-Senator-John-Glenn-dies-at-95-in-Columbus/stories/201612080085  title=Godspeed, John Glenn July 18, 1921 – Dec. 8, 2016  last=Shribman  first=David M.  date=2016-12-08  newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette}}</ref> In the last half of his missions, Williams was flying as Glenns wingman.

His biographer, Leigh Montville, argued that Williams was not happy about being pressed into service in South Korea, but he did what he thought was his patriotic duty.

Following his return to the United States in August 1953, he resigned his Reserve commission to resume his baseball career.<ref name=Fortitudine/>

After retirement from play, Williams helped Bostons new left fielder, Carl Yastrzemski, in hitting, and was a regular visitor to the Red Sox spring training camps from 1961 to 1966, where he worked as a special batting instructor. He served as executive assistant to Tom Yawkey (1961–65), then was named a team vice president (1965–68) upon his election to the Hall of Fame. He resumed his spring training instruction role with the club in 1978.

Williams served as manager of the Washington Senators (1961–71) Washington Senators, from 1969 Washington Senators season 1969–1971 Washington Senators season 1971, then continued with the team when they became the Texas Rangers (baseball) Texas Rangers after the 1971 season. Williams best season as a manager was 1969 when he led the expansion Senators to an 86–76 record in the teams only winning season in Washington. He was chosen "Manager of the Year" after that season. Like many great players, Williams became impatient with ordinary athletes abilities and attitudes, particularly those of pitchers, whom he admitted he never respected. He occasionally appeared at Red Sox spring training as a guest hitting instructor. Williams would also go into a partnership with friend Al Cassidy to form the Ted Williams Baseball Camp in Lakeville, Massachusetts. It was not uncommon to find Williams fishing in the pond at the camp. The area now is owned by the town and a few of the buildings still stand. In the main lodge one can still see memorabilia from Williams playing days.

On the subject of pitchers, in Teds autobiography written with John Underwood, Ted opines regarding Bob Lemon (a sinker-ball specialist) pitching for the Cleveland Indians around 1951: "I have to rate Lemon as one of the very best pitchers I ever faced. His ball was always moving, hard, sinking, fast-breaking. You could never really uhmmmph with Lemon."

Williams was much more successful in fishing. An avid and expert fly fishing fly fisherman and deep-sea fisherman, he spent many summers after baseball fishing the Miramichi River, in Miramichi, New Brunswick, Canada. Williams was named to the International Game Fish Association Hall of Fame in 2000. Williams, Jim Brown, Cumberland Posey, and Cal Hubbard are the only athletes to be inducted into the Halls of Fame of more than one professional sport. Williams was also known as an accomplished hunter; he was fond of pigeon-shooting for sport in Fenway Park during his career, on one occasion drawing the ire of the MSPCA-Angell Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.<ref>{{cite web url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=99k0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=8kMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6394,2747351 title=Rome News-Tribune - Google News Archive Search publisher=}}</ref> He later buried a bag of endangered terns beneath the pitchers mound of Fenway Park{{Citation needed date=July 2016}} (which today maintains an "open permit" to remove hawk nests from the stadium, after a 2008 hawk attack on a patron<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.palemale.com/fepain.html title=Fenway Park Incident publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/04/04/teen_finds_fowl_territory_at_fenway/ title=Teen finds fowl territory at Fenway first=Andrew last=Ryan date=4 April 2008 publisher= via=The Boston Globe}}</ref>).

Williams reached an extensive deal with Sears, Roebuck and Company Sears, lending his name and talent toward marketing, developing, and endorsing a line of in-house sports equipment – such as the "Ted Williams" edition Gamefisher aluminum boat and 7.5&nbsp;hp "Ted Williams" edition motor, as well as fishing, hunting, and baseball equipment. Williams continued his involvement in the Jimmy Fund, later losing a brother to leukemia, and spending much of his spare time, effort, and money in support of the cancer organization.

In his later years Williams became a fixture at autograph shows and card shows after his son (by his third wife), John Henry Williams (baseball) John Henry Williams, took control of his career, becoming his de facto manager. The younger Williams provided structure to his fathers business affairs, exposed forgeries that were flooding the memorabilia market, and rationed his fathers public appearances and memorabilia signings to maximize their earnings.

One of Ted Williams final, and most memorable, public appearances was at the 1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Game 1999 All-Star Game in Boston. Able to walk only a short distance, Williams was brought to the pitchers mound in a golf cart. He proudly waved his cap to the crowd—a gesture he had never done as a player. Fans responded with a standing ovation that lasted several minutes. At the pitchers mound he was surrounded by players from both teams, including fellow Red Sox player Nomar Garciaparra. Later in the year, he was among the members of the Major League Baseball All-Century Team introduced to the crowd at Turner Field in Atlanta prior to Game two of the 1999 World Series World Series.

==Personal life==
On May 4, 1944, Williams married Doris Soule, daughter of his hunting guide. Their daughter, Barbara Joyce ("Bobbi Jo"), was born on January 28, 1948, while Williams was fishing in Florida.<ref>[http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/williams_family_values/ "Williams Family Values" Boston Magazine] Accessed January 23, 2009 {{webarchive  url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313133257/http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/williams_family_values/  date=March 13, 2012 }}</ref> They divorced in 1954. Williams married the socialite model Lee Howard on September 10, 1961, and they were divorced in 1967.

Williams married Dolores Wettach, a former Miss Vermont and Vogue (magazine) Vogue model, in 1968. Their son John Henry Williams (baseball) John-Henry was born on August 27, 1968, followed by daughter Claudia, on October 8, 1971. They were divorced in 1972.<ref>Hitter, Ed Linn, p. 355/7</ref>

Williams lived with Louise Kaufman for twenty years until her death in 1993.

==Death==

In his last years, Williams suffered from cardiomyopathy. He had a pacemaker implanted in November 2000 and he underwent open-heart surgery in January 2001. After suffering a series of strokes and congestive heart failure, he died of cardiac arrest at the age of 83 on July 5, 2002, at Citrus Memorial Hospital, Inverness, Florida, near his home in Citrus Hills, Florida.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/news/2002/07/05/williams_obit/   work=CNN   title=Hall of Famer was last major leaguer to hit over .400}}</ref>

==Cryonics==
Though his will stated his desire to be cremated and his ashes scattered in the Florida Keys, Williamss son John-Henry and younger daughter Claudia chose to have his remains cryonics frozen cryonically.

Teds elder daughter, Bobby-Jo Ferrell, brought suit to have her fathers wishes recognized. John-Henrys lawyer then produced an informal "family pact" signed by Ted, Claudia, and John-Henry, in which they agreed "to be put into biostasis after we die" to "be able to be together in the future, even if it is only a chance."<ref name="cbs">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/20/national/main533849.shtml Ted Williams Frozen In Two Pieces, Meant To Be Frozen In Time; Head Decapitated, Cracked, DNA Missing] CBS News</ref> Bobby-Jo and her attorney, Spike Fitzpatrick (former attorney of Ted Williams), contended that the family pact, which was scribbled on an ink-stained napkin, was forged by John-Henry and/or Claudia.<ref name="sptimes">{{cite web url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/07/20/news_pf/Citrus/Williams__shift_from_.shtml title=Citrus: Williams shift from will must be proved publisher=}}</ref> Fitzpatrick and Ferrell believed that the signature was not obtained legally.<ref name="sptimes2">{{cite news  url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/384746991.html?dids=384746991:384746991&FMT=FT&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Aug+16%2C+2003&author=COLLEEN+JENKINS&pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&edition=&startpage=1&desc=No+charges+filed+on+Williams+note   work=St. Petersburg Times   title=No charges filed on Williams note}}</ref> Laboratory analysis proved that the signature was genuine.<ref name="sptimes2"/> John-Henry said that his father was a believer in science and was willing to try cryonics if it held the possibility of reuniting the family.<ref name="nytimes">

Though the family pact upset some friends, family and fans, a public plea for financial support of the lawsuit by Ferrell produced little result.<ref name="nytimes"/> Citing financial difficulties, Ferrell dropped her lawsuit in exchange that a $645,000 trust fund left by Williams would immediately pay the sum out equally to the three children.<ref name="nytimes"/> Inquiries to cryonics organizations increased after the publicity from the case.<ref name="sptimes"/>

In Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero, author Leigh Montville claims that the family cryonics pact was a practice Ted Williams autograph on a plain piece of paper, around which the agreement had later been hand written. The pact document was signed "Ted Williams", the same as his autographs, whereas he would always sign his legal documents "Theodore Williams", according to Montville. However, Claudia testified to the authenticity of the document in an affidavit.<ref>[http://www.wfu.edu/~chesner/Evidence/Linked%20Files/Additional%20Assigned%20Readings/ted.williams.htm]{{dead link date=May 2016 bot=medic}}{{cbignore bot=medic}}</ref> Teds two 24-hour private caregivers who were with him the entire period the note was said to have been created also stated in affidavits that John-Henry and Claudia were never present at any time for the note to be produced.

Following John-Henrys unexpected illness and death from acute myeloid leukemia on March 6, 2004, John-Henrys body was also transported to Alcor Life Extension Foundation Alcor, in fulfillment of the family agreement.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=1753358 title=John Henry Williams dies of leukemia at 35 date=13 March 2004 publisher=}}</ref>

==Awards and recognition==
In 1954, Williams was also inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the [https://web.archive.org/web/20091002174619/http://www.sdhoc.com/awards/hall-of-fame/baseball/ted-williams/ Breitbard Hall of Fame] honoring San Diegos finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.<ref>[http://www.sdhoc.com/awards/hall-of-fame/baseball/ted-williams/ Hall of Fame   San Diego Hall of Champions<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive  url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002174619/http://www.sdhoc.com/awards/hall-of-fame/baseball/ted-williams/  date=October 2, 2009 }}</ref>

Williams was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 25, 1966.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.baseballhall.org/hall-famers/hall-fame-weekend/past-ceremonies/1966-induction-ceremony title=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. 1966 Induction Ceremony publisher= deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811054112/http://baseballhall.org/hall-famers/hall-fame-weekend/past-ceremonies/1966-induction-ceremony archivedate=2013-08-11 df=}}</ref> In his induction speech, Williams included a statement calling for the recognition of the great Negro Leagues players: "Ive been a very lucky guy to have worn a baseball uniform, and I hope some day the names of Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson in some way can be added as a symbol of the great Negro players who are not here only because they werent given a chance."<ref name="Montville, p. 262">(Montville, p.&nbsp;262)</ref>

Williams was referring to two of the most famous names in the Negro Leagues, who were not given the opportunity to play in the Major Leagues before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947. Gibson died early in 1947 and thus never played in the majors; and Paiges brief major league stint came long past his prime as a player. This powerful and unprecedented statement from the Hall of Fame podium was "a first crack in the door that ultimately would open and include Paige and Gibson and other Negro League stars in the shrine."<ref name="Montville, p. 262"/> Paige was the first inducted in 1971. Gibson and others followed, starting in 1972 and continuing off and on into the 21st Century.

On November 18, 1991, President George H. W. Bush presented Williams with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the US.

The Ted Williams Tunnel in Boston, Massachusetts, carrying {{Convert 1.6 mi km }} of the final {{Convert 2.3 miles km }} of Interstate 90 under Boston Harbor, opened in December 1995, and Ted Williams Parkway (California State Route 56) in San Diego County, California, opened in 1992, were named in his honor while he was still alive. In 2016, the major league San Diego Padres inducted Williams into San Diego Padres Hall of Fame their hall of fame for his contributions to baseball in San Diego.<ref>{{cite news last=Acee first=Kevin title=Padres honoring Ted Williams is right on many levels date=June 30, 2016 newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/jun/30/padres-honoring-ted-williams-is-right-on-many/ archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701135720/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/jun/30/padres-honoring-ted-williams-is-right-on-many/ archivedate=July 1, 2016 deadurl=no}}</ref>

The Tampa Bay Rays home field, Tropicana Field, installed the Ted Williams Museum (formerly in Hernando, Florida, 1994–2006) behind the left field fence. From the Tampa Bay Rays website: "The Ted Williams Museum and Hitters Hall of Fame brings a special element to the Tropicana Field. Fans can view an array of different artifacts and pictures of the Greatest hitter that ever lived. These memorable displays range from Ted Williams days in the military through his professional playing career. This museum is dedicated to some of the greatest players to ever lace em up, including Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris."

==Legacy==
At the time of his retirement, Williams ranked third all-time in home runs (behind Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx), seventh in RBIs (after Ruth, Cap Anson, Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, Foxx, and Mel Ott; Stan Musial passed Williams in 1962), and seventh in batting average (behind Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Lefty ODoul, Ed Delahanty and Tris Speaker). His career batting average is the highest of any player who played his entire career in the live-ball era following 1920.

Williams was also second to Ruth in career slugging percentage, where he remains today, and first in on-base percentage, with .4817. He was also second to Ruth in career walks, but has since dropped to fourth place behind Barry Bonds and Rickey Henderson. Williams remains the career leader in walks per plate appearance.

Most modern statistical analyses place Williams, along with Ruth and Bonds, among the three most potent hitters to have played the game. Williams baseball season of 1941 is often considered favorably with the greatest seasons of Ruth and Bonds in terms of various offensive statistical measures such as slugging, on-base and "offensive winning percentage." As a further indication, of the ten best seasons for On-base plus slugging OPS, short for On-Base Plus Slugging Percentage, a popular modern measure of offensive productivity, four each were achieved by Ruth and Bonds, and two by Williams.

Although Williams career did not overlap with that of Ruth or Bonds, a direct comparison with another great hitter, Hank Aaron, is possible.
From 1955 to 1960, Williams maintained an average OPS of 1.092, as compared with .950 for Aaron. Williams age (37-42) was well past the prime of most hitters, but he still managed to hit .388 at the age of 39. Although Aaron (age 21-26) recorded only one of his five best seasons, their averages are not too far from the career averages of the two baseball players.

In 1999, Williams was ranked as number eight on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, where he was the highest-ranking left fielder.<ref>{{Cite news year=1999 title=Baseballs 100 Greatest Players work=The Sporting News page=20}}</ref>
