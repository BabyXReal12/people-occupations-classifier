Major Scott Douglas Anderson (May 2, 1965 – March 23, 1999) was a late 20th-century American polymath: Air National Guard General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon F-16 pilot (aeronautics) pilot, general aviation test pilot, flight instructor, Flight dispatcher flight operations officer, engineer, inventor, musician, American football football player, outdoor recreation outdoor adventurist, and award-winning author. He is perhaps most notable for his achievements in 1998 flight-testing the first type certificate certified whole-plane Cirrus Airframe Parachute System parachute recovery system, which is credited with saving over 140 lives as a standard equipment on Cirrus Aircrafts line of single-engine aircraft.

Anderson was killed near the Duluth International Airport while testing the first production model Cirrus SR20. He was posthumously inducted into the Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame in 2010 for his contributions to the development and advancement of aviation in the state. The Scott D. Anderson Leadership Foundation was created in his honor.<ref name=SalfLeadersWhoIsScott>{{cite web url=http://www.salfleaders.com/about/scottanderson.htm title=Who Is Scott? website=Salfleaders.com accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref><ref name=MinnesotaAviationHallofFame>{{cite web url=http://www.mnaviationhalloffame.org/inductees/a.html title= Inductees: A website=Mnaviationhalloffame.org accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref><ref name=DNT>{{cite web  url=http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/pilot-scott-anderson-remembered  last=Passie  first=Peter  title= Pilot Scott Anderson Remembered  publisher=Duluth News Tribune  date= 23 April 2010  accessdate= 11 July 2015}}</ref>

==Early years and education==
Scott Anderson and his family moved to Duluth, Minnesota when he was six years old. He graduated from Duluth East High School as a star football player and went on to attend the University of Minnesota. As an undergraduate engineering student-intern and a member of Minnesota Powers Research and Development team, Anderson earned recognition as co-inventor on a U.S. patent. He continued his college career later at Stanford University, where he led an undergraduate team to build a two-person submarine. Anderson graduated from Stanford with degrees in mechanical engineering and history.<ref name=SalfLeadersWhoIsScott/><ref name=MinnesotaAviationHallofFame/><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.salfleaders.com/support/index.htm title=Support - Scott D.

==Career==
In 1987, the summer after graduating college, he and his friend Steve Baker planned a marathon canoe canoe trip from Duluth to York Factory on the Hudson Bay.<ref name=CapitolWords>{{cite web  url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/25/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E578-1 title=Congressional Record - Tribute to Scott Anderson website=Congress.gov accessdate=August 24, 2017}}</ref> After completing the 1,700-mile-long exploit, Anderson wrote his first book, Distant Fires, published in 1990, an autobiographical adventure story based on his experiences during the journey. Distant Fires was widely received by the local community at the time of its release—the Duluth News Tribune describing it as a marvelous "voyage of discovery"—and went on to win the American Library Association ALA Best Fiction for Young Adults Best Book for Young Adults Award in 1991.<ref>{{cite web  url= http://www.librarything.com/bookaward/ALA+Best+Books+for+Young+Adults title=Book awards: ALA Best Books for Young Adults website= Librarything.com accessdate=August 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/distant-fires title=Distant Fires website=University of Minnesota Press accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref>

Anderson was known to have been a talented saxophonist, playing for multiple jazz bands around Duluth in the late 80s and early 90s. He then moved from the United States to Salzburg, Austria to play professional American football, before returning to become a pilot flying F-16 Fighting Falcon F-16s for the Air National Guard and flight instructor flight instructing with Duluths 179th Fighter Squadron.<ref name=MinnesotaAviationHallofFame/> His second publication, and first novel, Unknown Rider (1995), was a fictional manifestation of his experience achieving the title "Fighter Pilot". He summed up his writing process saying, "When I was training to fly the F-16 at Kingsley Field in Oregon, each evening, after a day of flying fighters, I sat down and typed a little bit of this book… All I had to do was invent a few characters, put them in an airplane, and make them the heroes of the stories that filled the air."<ref>{{cite web url=http://airandspacemuseum.org/news/?p=1081 title=Book Review: Unknown Rider by Major Scott D.

===Cirrus Aircraft===

In 1996, Andersons career path led him to Cirrus Aircraft Cirrus Design (now called Cirrus Aircraft), a newly Duluth-landed general aviation startup company startup founded by two brothers, Klapmeier brothers Alan and Dale Klapmeier, hailing from a rural Baraboo, Wisconsin southern Wisconsin farm. He was named Director of Dispatcher Flight Operations along with Chief Test pilot Test Pilot for the company, contributing his efforts to the early developmental stages of the Cirrus SR20 single-engine four-seat Composite material composite aircraft. In addition to all-composite construction, the SR20 introduced the light aircraft manufacturing industry to a number of innovative new designs, including a single power-lever that adjusts both throttle and propeller RPM, a side-yoke flight control system, a leading edge cuff spin-resistant wing design, and a large LCD screen for the avionics.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.flyingmag.com/photo-gallery/photos/top-100-airplanes-platinum-edition?image=90 title=Top 100 Airplanes:Platinum Edition publisher=Flying date= accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref><ref name="FlyingMag.com">{{cite web url=http://www.flyingmag.com/aircraft/pistons/10-ways-sr22-changed-flying?page=0,0 title = 10 Ways that the SR22 Changed Flying authorlink =  first = Robert last = Goyer year =2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.flyingmag.com/photo-gallery/photos/top-25-coolest-aircraft?image=4 title = Top 25 Coolest Aircraft authorlink =  first = Robert  last = Goyer year = 2014 website=Flyingmag.com accessdate=2017-08-22}}</ref> In 1997, Anderson became the lead test pilot on a ground breaking safety innovation by Ballistic Recovery Systems and Cirrus Aircraft. The feature was titled Cirrus Airframe Parachute System CAPS (Cirrus Airframe Parachute System), and acted as a parachute recovery device installed on the SR20 that was designed to lower the entire aircraft safely to the ground after a loss of control or structural failure.<ref name=CapitolWords/><ref>{{cite web last=Goyer first=Robert url=http://www.flyingmag.com/blogs/going-direct/after-10-years-cirrus-chute-controversy-persists title=After Ten Years, Cirrus Chute Controversy Persists publisher=Flying date=August 2010 accessdate=24 August 2017 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026150049/http://www.flyingmag.com/blogs/going-direct/after-10-years-cirrus-chute-controversy-persists archivedate=26 October 2014 df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Anderson worked closest on the project with fellow Cirrus test pilot Gary Black,<ref name=DNT/> who also formally flew jets for the military, as well as the companys Chief Engineer, Paul Johnston, who played a crucial role in the design process of the CAP system.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite web last=Fallows  first=James  url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/21/magazine/turn-left-at-cloud-109.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm  title=Turn Left at Cloud 109  publisher=The New York Times  date= November 21, 1999  accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref><ref name=TheAtlantic>{{cite web last=Fallows  first=James  url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/2001/06/fallows.htm  title=Freedom of the Skies  publisher=The Atlantic  date= June 2001  accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> CAPS testing began by the summer of 1998. The Cirrus team went out to the high desert of California where Anderson would make the first flight. He deployed the parachute multiple times during dives and spins, to simulate recovery after a midair collision or after spatial disorientation, and from level flight to resemble engine failure. At this time Cirrus only had two SR20 prototypes, so in order to test the parachute repeatedly Anderson would restart the engine mid-air while descending under the parachute, cut the chute loose and land the plane normally for it to be tested again (ground-impact testing took place with a mockup that would be dropped at the calculated descent-velocity and measured based on sustained damage to the fuselage).<ref name=TheAtlantic/><ref>{{cite web url=http://cirrusaircraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CAPS_Guide.pdf title=Guide to the CIRRUS AIRFRAME PARACHUTE SYSTEM last = Cirrus Aircraft  accessdate=2015-05-02}}</ref> Anderson successfully made all seven of the companys in-flight test deployments of CAPS. The SR20 became FAA approved and type certificate typed certified in October 1998, making Anderson the first pilot in history to successfully test a certified aircraft equipped with a ballistic parachute.<ref name="A00009CH">{{cite web url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/0/169146a0f8275d0a86257b0b00564a20/$FILE/A00009CH_Rev_19.pdf title=Type Certification Data Sheet A00009CH last = Federal Aviation Administration  accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref><ref name=FlightGlobal>{{cite web last=Higdon  first=Dave  url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/cirrus-sr20-demonstrator-kills-test-pilot-in-prison-49656/  title=Cirrus SR20 demonstrator kills test pilot in prison crash  website=Flighglobal.com  date =March 31, 1999  accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.brsaerospace.com/BRS_History.html title=BRS History accessdate=2017-08-24}}</ref>

==Death==
The following year, on 23 March 1999, Anderson died while putting the first production SR20 aircraft through experimental test flights before it went on sale. The purpose of the flight was to perform routine torture-test maneuvers and assess changes to the aileron if there were any issues. The incident occurred after the planes aileron had jammed.<ref name=NYTimes/><ref name=LidleLawsuit>{{cite web last=Fallows  first=James  url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2007/03/lidle-lawsuit-update-the-myth-of-quot-aileron-failure-quot/7541/  title=Lidle lawsuit update: the myth of aileron failure  publisher=The Atlantic  date= March 7, 2007  accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> Anderson was about 4 nautical miles out from the Duluth International Airport at the start of the flight when he radioed the control tower that he was returning due to a problem. At about 1.5 nautical miles from the airport, he declared an emergency. Less than 400 meters out, Anderson crashed near the medical facility on the prison grounds; he died later that day in the hospital.<ref name=FlightGlobal/> The plane Anderson was flying had not yet been equipped with the standard CAPS that would come on every aircraft.<ref name=NYTimes/><ref name=LidleLawsuit/> Due to Cirrus being in very early production phase, the company was 10 days away from receiving production model chute systems at the time of Andersons death. Cirrus has never test-flown an aircraft without a parachute since.<ref name=DNT/>

===Posthumous recognition===

18-term Minnesota Congressman Jim Oberstar paid tribute to Anderson shortly after his death, calling him a "hero" and a "pioneer in general aviation". Oberstar went on saying, "Scott made a profound difference to the State of Minnesota and to the national aviation community".<ref name=CapitolWords/> Cirrus Aircraft Co-Founder and CEO Klapmeier brothers Dale Klapmeier spoke at Andersons induction into the Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame on 24 April 2010, stating, "Scott was an exemplary pilot and person. During his tenure at Cirrus, he made considerable contributions to the company, the industry, and aviation safety that many people still benefit from today… To date, 17 CAPS deployments have saved 35 lives due to Scotts pioneering work."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?do=main.textpost&id=e83bcb54-7b29-4950-876b-9ec778bfdf0d title=Scott D.

Anderson has been referenced multiple times in national articles and columns such as The Atlantic The Atlantic Monthly and The New York Times by journalist, author and former speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter, James Fallows. He has often been credited by Fallows as being a "Renaissance man" and "beloved, charismatic figure of Duluth". Anderson was also a supporting theme in his 2001 book, Free Flight: Inventing the Future of Travel.<ref name=NYTimes/><ref name=TheAtlantic/><ref name=LidleLawsuit/>
