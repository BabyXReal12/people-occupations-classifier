Sean Tucker, a native of Eagle Rock, Los Angeles Eagle Rock, California, earned his Pilot certification in the United States#Private pilot pilot’s certificate at age 17. His father, William, was an aviation industry lawyer who had learned to fly as part of his job.<ref name="Hirschon">Yakov M. Hirschon, "[http://www.zmanmagazine.com/PDF/Stunt%20Pilot.pdf The Worlds Top Stunt Pilot]", ZMAN, September 2012, page 90.</ref> Tucker started out as a cropduster, eventually starting a cropdusting business in Salinas, California.<ref name="Boys Life">"Stunt Pilot," Boys Life, April 1994, page 19.</ref> In order to overcome his fear of crashing, he took an aerobatics course, through which he "found out you could roll an airplane upside down and it wouldnt fall out of the sky."<ref name="Boys Life"/> He has been flying airshows worldwide since the mid-1970s and is considered by many to be one of the world’s premier airshow performers. Tuckers favorite stunt is the "triple ribbon cut", where he uses his plane to cut three ribbons suspended between poles from three different angles.<ref name="Boys Life"/> Despite once having a fear of flying, Tucker has flown more than 1,000 performances at more than 425 airshows, in front of more than 80 million spectators.

Tuckers first sponsorship was with Randolph Sunglasses from 1993 through 1995, then in 1996 he transitioned to MCI Inc. MCI under the 1-800-COLLECT and 10-10-220 brands until his start with Oracle in 2001.

Team Oracle states Tucker has been named one of the Living Legends of Aviation, is the recipient of the Crystal Eagle Award, was an inductee at the 2001 USAF Gathering of Eagles, and in 2003 was named one of the Smithsonian National Air & Space Museums 25 Living Legends of Flight.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.oracle.com/us/assets/team-oracle-media-kit-2179517.pdf title=Team Oracle 2017 Media Kit publisher=Oracle Corporation Oracle accessdate=August 9, 2017}}</ref>

To endure the extreme physical demands of his acrobatic flying routine, Tucker maintains a rigorous physical training schedule, working out more than 340 days per year in a routine of jogging and weightlifting on alternating days. His other physical activities include mountain climbing, heli-skiing, cave SCUBA diving, and golfing. When asked about flying airshows, Tucker has said, "I like to think that I bring the fans dreams of flying into the plane with me and theres nowhere I’d rather be than in the cockpit. That’s why I train so hard to keep a finely tuned edge."

Tucker’s self-proclaimed goal is to "share the magic of flight with Team Oracle’s guests by inspiring and thrilling them. I want them to go away saying that the airshow was one of the most engaging days of their lives."

He is one of only a handful of civilian performers who have been allowed to fly close formation with the Blue Angels and the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds Thunderbirds.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.oracle.com/cluboracle/teamoracle/about.html title= About Sean Tucker  accessdate=November 4, 2007  publisher=Oracle}}</ref>

In 2013, Tucker was appointed Chairman of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) program Young Eagles, which introduces and educates children aged 8 to 17 about aviation. It has given flights to over 2 million children around the world. Tucker is an annual fixture at the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh airshow each summer. At the 2016 event, Tucker was joined by past EAA Young Eagles chairmen Harrison Ford, Chesley Sullenberger and Jeff Skiles as they flew the 2 millionth Young Eagle.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.eaa.org/en/eaa/eaa-news-and-aviation-news/news/09-15-2016-harrison-ford-kicks-off-25th-anniversary-of-young-eagles title=Harrison Ford Kicks Off 25th Anniversary of Young Eagles publisher=Experimental Aircraft Association accessdate=August 9, 2017}}</ref>

Tuckers airplane, the Oracle Challenger III biplane, is claimed to produce more than 400 horsepower, and weighs only 1,200 pounds. The Challenger III is equipped with a unique set of wings that use 8 ailerons instead of 4. The tail on the airplane is modeled after the tail used on high-performance radio control airplanes.

==Accidents==
Tuckers first accident occurred in 1979, when he had to parachute out of his disabled aerobatic airplane.<ref name="Boys Life"/>

In 1993, as he was climbing out of the parked stunt plane he used at the time, a Pitts Special Pitts S-2S biplane, a runaway aircraft on the ground collided with his aircraft. Tucker escaped unscathed, but damage to the wings on one side of his aircraft took ten days to repair.<ref name="Boys Life"/>

In 2006, the elevator (pitch control) system in Tuckers aerobatic aircraft broke during a practice aerobatic flight, forcing him to Parachute bail out over an empty farm field in Coushatta, Louisiana. He was uninjured, but the aircraft he was flying was destroyed.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.klfy.com/Global/story.asp?S=4725123 title= Stunt plane crashes after control stick breaks  accessdate=November 4, 2007  publisher=KLFY }}</ref>
