Hoover left the Air Force for civilian jobs in 1948.<ref name="Forever_Flying_p137">Hoover 1997, p. 137.</ref> After a brief time with Allison Engine Company, he worked as a test/demonstration pilot with North American Aviation, in which capacity he went to Korea to teach pilots in the Korean War how to dive-bomb with the North American F-86 Sabre F-86 Sabre.

During the 1950s, Hoover visited many active-duty, reserve, and Air National Guard units to demonstrate planes capabilities to their pilots. Hoover flew flight tests on the North American FJ-2 Fury FJ-2 Fury, F-86 Sabre, and the North American F-100 Super Sabre F-100 Super Sabre.

In the early 1960s, Hoover began flying the North American P-51 Mustang at air shows around the country. The Hoover Mustang (N2251D) was purchased by North American Aviation from Dave Lindsays Cavalier Aircraft Cavalier Aircraft Corp. in 1962. A second Mustang (N51RH), later named "Ole Yeller", was purchased by North American Rockwell from Cavalier in 1971 to replace the earlier aircraft, which had been destroyed in a ground accident when an oxygen bottle exploded after being overfilled. Hoover demonstrated the Mustang and later the Aero Commander 500 family Aero Commander at hundreds of air shows until his retirement in the 1990s. In 1997, Hoover sold "Ole Yeller" to his good friend John Bagley of Rexburg, Idaho.

Hoover was best known for his civil air show career, which started when he was hired to demonstrate the capabilities of Aero Commanders Aero Commander 500 family Shrike Commander, a twin piston-engined business aircraft that had developed a staid reputation due to its bulky shape. Hoover showed the strength of the plane as he put the aircraft through rolls, loops, and other maneuvers, which most people would not associate with executive aircraft. As a grand finale, he shut down both engines and executed a loop and an eight-point hesitation slow roll as he headed back to the runway. Upon landing he would touch down on one tire followed gradually by the other. After pulling off the runway, he would start his engines to taxi back to the parking area. On airfields with large enough parking ramps (such as the Reno Stead Airport, where the Reno Air Races take place), Hoover would sometimes land directly on the ramp and coast all the way back to his parking spot in front of the grandstand without restarting the engines. He was also known for creating the stunt of successfully pouring a cup of tea while performing a g-force 1G barrel roll.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9pvG_ZSnCc  title=Bob Hoover Barrel Roll publisher=YouTube  date=2014  accessdate=2017-11-02}}</ref>

His air show aerobatics career ended in 1999, but was marked by issues with the FAA over his medical certification that began when Hoovers medical certificate was revoked by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the early 1990s.<ref name="Forever_Flying_p278_279">Hoover 1997, pp. 278–279.</ref><ref name="Facts">Jordan, Jon L., MD, JD.

Retrieved: July 19, 2015.</ref>

Shortly before his revocation, Hoover experienced serious engine problems in a North American T-28 Trojan off the coast of California. During his return to Torrance, California Torrance, he was able to keep the engine running intermittently by constantly manipulating the throttle, mixture, and propeller levers. The engine seized at the moment of touchdown. Hoover believed his successful management of this difficult emergency should have convinced the FAA that he hadnt lost any ability.<ref name="Forever_Flying_p280">Hoover 1997, p. 280.</ref> Meanwhile, Hoover was granted a pilots license, and medical certificate by Australias aviation authorities.<ref name="Forever_Flying_p281_282">Hoover 1997, pp. 281–282.</ref> Hoovers medical certificate was restored shortly afterward and he returned to the American air show circuit for several years before retiring in 1999. At 77 years old Hoover still felt capable of performing and passed a rigorous FAA physical post retirement, but he was unable to obtain insurance for air shows. Although he had had free insurance for several years as part of air show sponsorship deals, he was forced in 1999 to pay for it out of his own pocket and could not get coverage under $2 million. His final air show was on November 13, 1999 at Luke Air Force base. His last flight in his famous Shrike Commander was on October 10, 2003 from Lakeland, Florida to the Smithsonian Air and Space museum in Washington D.C. with long time friend Steve Clegg.

Following Hoovers retirement, his Shrike Commander was placed on display at the National Air and Space Museum, Udvar-Hazy Center, in Dulles, Virginia.<ref>[http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A20000796000 "North American Rockwell Shrike Commander 500S, Robert A.

==Hoover Nozzle and Hoover Ring==
The "Hoover Nozzle", used on jet fuel pumps, is designed with a flattened bell shape. It cannot be inserted in the filler neck of a plane with the "Hoover Ring" installed, thus preventing the tank from accidentally being filled with jet fuel.

This system was given this name following an accident in which Hoover was seriously injured, when both engines on his Shrike Commander failed during takeoff. Investigators found that the plane had just been fueled by line personnel who mistook the piston-engine Shrike for a similar turboprop model, filling the tanks with jet fuel instead of avgas (aviation gasoline).<ref name="Forever_Flying_p275_277">Hoover 1997, pp. 275–277.</ref> There was enough avgas in the fuel system to taxi to the runway and take off, but then the jet fuel was drawn into the engines, causing them to stop.

Once Hoover recovered, he widely promoted<ref>[http://avstop.com/news_sept_2010/six_aviation_legends_to_be_recognized_as_master_pilots.htm "Six aviation legends to be recognized as Master Pilots."] Aviation Online Magazine, September 19, 2010.
