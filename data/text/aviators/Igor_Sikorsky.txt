==Early life==
Igor Sikorsky was born in Kiev, Russian Empire (<!-- Kiev -->in present-day Ukraine), the youngest of five children.

While homeschooling young Igor, she gave him a great love for art, especially in the life and work of Leonardo da Vinci, and the stories of Jules Verne. In 1900, at age 11, he accompanied his father to Germany and through conversations with his father, became interested in natural sciences. After returning home, Sikorsky began to experiment with model flying machines, and by age 12, he had made a small rubber band-powered helicopter.<ref>Woods 1979, p. 254.</ref>

Sikorsky began studying at the Saint Petersburg Maritime Cadet Corps, in 1903, at the age of 14. In 1906, he determined that his future lay in engineering, so he resigned from the academy, despite his satisfactory standing, and left the Russian Empire to study in Paris. He returned to the Russian Empire in 1907, enrolling at the Mechanical College of the Kiev Polytechnic Institute. After the academic year, Sikorsky again accompanied his father to Germany in the summer of 1908, where he learned of the accomplishments of the Wright brothers Flyer and Ferdinand von Zeppelins dirigible.<ref name="franklin2">[https://www.fi.edu/case-files/igor-sikorsky "The Case Files: Igor Sikorsky"].

With financial backing from his sister Olga, Sikorsky returned to Paris, the center of the aviation world at the time, in 1909. Sikorsky met with aviation pioneers, to ask them questions about aircraft and flying. In May 1909, he returned to Russia and began designing his first helicopter, which he began testing in July 1909. Despite his progress in solving technical problems of control, Sikorsky realized that the aircraft would never fly. He finally disassembled the aircraft in October 1909, after he determined that he could learn nothing more from the design.<ref name="Woods 255">Woods 1979, p. 255.</ref>

<blockquote>I had learned enough to recognize that with the existing state of the art, engines, materials, and – most of all – the shortage of money and lack of experience... I would not be able to produce a successful helicopter at that time.<ref name=Britannica>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/543984/Igor-Ivan-Sikorsky "Igor Sikorsky."] Encyclopædia Britannica, 2009 via britannica.com.

Sikorskys first aircraft of his own design, the S-1 used a 15&nbsp;hp Anzani 3-cylinder fan engine in a pusher configuration, that could not lift the aircraft. His second design called the S-2 was powered by a 25&nbsp;hp Anzani engine in a tractor configuration and first flew on June 3, 1910 at a height of a few feet. On June 30 after some modifications, Sikorsky reached an altitude of "sixty or eighty feet" before the S-2 stalled and was completely destroyed when it crashed in a ravine.<ref name=winged>{{cite book  last=Sikorsky  first=Igor first2= last2= title=The Story of the Winged-S year=1944 publisher=Dodd, Mead & Company location=New York isbn=9781258163556 page=48}}</ref><ref>"Sikorsky Celebrates."

It was discovered that a mosquito in the gasoline had been drawn into the carburetor, starving the engine of fuel. The close call convinced Sikorsky of the need for an aircraft that could continue flying if it lost an engine.<ref>Current Biography 1940, pp. 734–736.</ref> His next aircraft, the S-6 held three passengers and was selected as the winner of the Moscow aircraft exhibition held by the Imperial Russian Army Russian Army in February 1912.<ref name="Woods 1979, p. 256"/>

In the U.S., Sikorsky first worked as a school teacher and a lecturer, while looking for an opportunity to work in the aviation industry. In 1932, he joined the faculty of the University of Rhode Island to form an aeronautical engineering program and remained with the university until 1948.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.uri.edu/home/about/history_timeline.html title=URI History and Timeline publisher=University of Rhode Island accessdate=July 17, 2010 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6D8S8XJFr?url=http://www.uri.edu/home/about/history_timeline.html archivedate=December 23, 2012 df=mdy-all}}</ref> He also lectured at the University of Bridgeport.

In 1923, Sikorsky formed the Sikorsky Aircraft Sikorsky Manufacturing Company in Roosevelt, New York.<ref>Spenser 1998, p. 15.</ref> He was helped by several former Russian military officers. Among Sikorskys chief supporters was composer Sergei Rachmaninoff, who introduced himself by writing a check for US$5,000 (approximately $61,000 in 2007).<ref>Prokhorov, Vadim.

Retrieved: July 17, 2010.</ref>  Although his prototype was damaged in its first test flight, Sikorsky persuaded his reluctant backers to invest another $2,500.

In 1928, Sikorsky became a naturalized citizen of the United States. The Sikorsky Manufacturing Company moved to Stratford, Connecticut in 1929. It became a part of the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (now United Technologies Corporation) in July of that year.<ref>Spenser 1998, pp. 15–17.</ref>  The company manufactured flying boats, such as the Sikorsky S-42 S-42 "Clipper", used by Pan American World Airways Pan Am for transatlantic flights.<ref name=Britannica/>

Meanwhile, Sikorsky also continued his earlier work on vertical flight while living in Nichols, Connecticut. On February 14, 1929, he filed an application to patent a "direct lift" amphibian aircraft which used compressed air to power a direct lift "propeller" and two smaller propellers for thrust.<ref>[https://www.google.com/patents/about?id=j4hOAAAAEBAJ&dq=igor+sikorsky+nichols+ct "Patent number: 1848389"] google.com.

Sikorskys success with the VS-300 led to the Sikorsky R-4 R-4, which became the worlds first mass-produced helicopter, in 1942. Sikorskys final VS-300 rotor configuration, comprising a single main rotor and a single antitorque tail rotor, has proven to be one of the most popular helicopter configurations, being used in most helicopters produced today.<ref name="Woods 1979, p. 262"/>

Igor Sikorsky was also on the board of directors for the Tolstoy Foundation Center in Valley Cottage, New York.{{cn date=May 2018}}
