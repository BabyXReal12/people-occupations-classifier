He was inspired to run for Congress by a suggestion from a talk radio show host that voters demand town hall meetings with their congressmen during the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act health care bill Tea Party movement protests of August 2009.
Cravaack went with 25 people to one of Oberstars Minnesota offices asking for a meeting that day and when Oberstar did not come, Cravaack decided to challenge him in the November 2010 election.
Cravaack entered the race as a political novice and an underdog.
The 8th had been in Democratic hands since 1947, and Oberstar was the longest-serving Congressman in Minnesotas history, usually cruising to re‑election.
Geography also seemed to be against Cravaack as well; his home in Lindstrom is located in Chisago County, in the southern portion of the district.

According to the Star Tribune, Cravaacks campaign was "structured like a military operation".
He toured the district in a motor home dubbed "The War Wagon," and ranked volunteers with titles such as commander, captain, and precinct lieutenant.
He discovered that his experience as a union steward attracted the interest of district voters, especially the miners.
Cravaack campaigned on a platform of free-market principles and government spending cuts.
He attacked Oberstars vote on the health care bill, saying he would vote to repeal and replace it, and called an Oberstar-approved extension of the Clean Water Act to include wet meadows, a "land grab" by the federal government.
He criticized the Earmark (politics) earmark process that Oberstar had used to fund infrastructure projects in the district, saying it was time for the spending to stop.
Cravaack also attacked Oberstars vote on "Emissions trading cap and trade" legislation to limit carbon emissions, saying it would result in higher energy prices.
In his first ad, Cravaack paid homage to Oberstars service, saying that he ran against Oberstar "with all due respect," but accused him of having lost touch with the district.
A candidate debate held in Duluth, Minnesota Duluth featured a crowd that jeered Oberstar, with Oberstar calling for a more civil atmosphere at the next debate.
The second debate centered on economic issues.
Cravaack argued that the 2003 Bush tax cuts should be continued on all tax brackets to stimulate employment, and Oberstar said he would end the tax cut for the top two percent of earners, because the lowered tax had caused part of the Deficit spending deficit.
A poll conducted for KSTP-TV in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul Twin Cities in October showed Oberstar ahead of Cravaack by only one point, 47 to 46 percent.
Cravaack received the Political endorsement endorsement of former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich as the polls tightened.
He was also endorsed by Minnesotas largest Opposition to legal abortion pro-life organization, Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, and the largest newspaper in the district, the Duluth News Tribune.
In the November 2 election, Cravaack scored one of the biggest upsets in Minnesota political history,
defeating Oberstar by only 4,400 votes, 48 percent to 47 percent.
Cravaack believed the abortion issue was crucial to his victory; he had argued that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act health care legislation that Oberstar had voted for allowed for the Abortion in the United States#Abortion financing payment of abortions with taxpayer funds, and Legality of euthanasia#United States encouraged euthanasia for the elderly.
By the time he won the election, Cravaack characterized the bill as an example of socialized medicine that will result in the rationing of medical care.

===Tenure===

He also came to press attention for implying during a United States House Committee on Homeland Security House Homeland Security Committee hearing that Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca was furthering the goals of a terrorist organization.
In March 2012 Cravaack introduced a bill in Congress that would allow mining and logging in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and Superior National Forest through a land exchange that would rely on the state environmental review process and bypass federal environmental reviews, with proceeds going to the school districts.
He also sponsored a bill,  which became law that the TSA ensures that military personnel were treated with respect while traveling on orders or while wearing their uniforms.  “The bill’s intent, he said, is that the military personnel would be able to go through security with the same ease as registered flyers.”
He is against sequestration and voted against the Budget Control Act, stating “You cut with a scalpel not a meat ax."
