==Early life==
John Alcock was born on 5 November 1892 at Basford House on Seymour Grove, Firswood, Manchester, England. He attended St Thomass Primary School in Heaton Chapel, Stockport and Heyhouses School in Lytham St Annes.<ref> [http://www.st-thomasheaton.stockport.sch.uk/1919.htm St. Thomass, Stockport] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005211158/http://www.st-thomasheaton.stockport.sch.uk/1919.htm  date=5 October 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web title=Blue Plaques url=http://www.lsacivic.org/215-2/ work=Lytham St Annes Civic Society accessdate=10 August 2014 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120703/http://www.lsacivic.org/215-2/ archivedate=26 August 2014 df=dmy-all}}</ref> He first became interested in flying at the age of 17. His first job was at the Empress Motor Works in Manchester. In 1910 he became an assistant to Works Manager Charles Fletcher, an early Manchester aviator<ref>Scholefield p.212</ref> and Norman Crossland, a motor engineer and founder of Manchester Aero Club. It was during this period that Alcock met the Frenchman Maurice Ducrocq who was both a demonstration pilot and UK sales representative for aero engines made by the Italian Spirito Mario Viale.

Ducrocq took Alcock on as a mechanic at the Brooklands aerodrome, Surrey, where he learned to fly at Ducrocqs flying school, gaining his pilots licence there in November 1912. Alcock then joined the Sunbeam Motor Car Company as a racing pilot. By summer 1914 he was proficient enough to compete in a Hendon-Birmingham-Manchester and return air race, flying a Farman biplane. He landed at Trafford Park Aerodrome (Manchester) Trafford Park Aerodrome and flew back to Hendon the same day.

==Military career==
At the outbreak of World War I, Alcock joined the Royal Naval Air Service as a warrant-officer instructor at the Royal Naval Flying School at RAF Eastchurch Eastchurch in Kent. It was whilst at Eastchurch that Alcock received his commission as a flight sub-lieutenant in December 1915. In 1916 he was transferred to a squadron operating at Moudros, on the Greek island of Lemnos. While stationed at Moudros he conceived and built the  Alcock Scout, a fighter aircraft built out of the remnants of unused and abandoned aircraft.

On 30 September 1917, whilst piloting a Sopwith Camel Alcock attacked three enemy aircraft, forcing two to crash into the sea. For this action he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom) Distinguished Service Cross. After returning to base he then piloted a Handley Page bomber on a raid to Constantinople. He was forced to turn back to base after an engine failed near Gallipoli. After flying on a single engine for more than 60 miles, that engine failed and the aircraft ditched in the sea, near Suvla Bay. Alcock and his crew of two were unable to attract nearby British destroyers, and when the plane finally began to sink they swam for an hour to reach the enemy-held shore. All three were taken prisoner next day by the Turkish forces. Alcock remained a prisoner of war until the Armistice and retired from the Royal Air Force in March 1919.

After the war Alcock became a test pilot for Vickers and took up the challenge of attempting to be the first to fly directly across the Atlantic.  Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown took off from St Johns, Newfoundland, at 1:45 pm local time on 14 June 1919, and landed in Derrygimla bog near Clifden, Ireland, 16 hours and 12 minutes later on 15 June 1919 after flying {{convert 1980 miles km abbr=on}}. The flight had been much affected by bad weather, making accurate navigation difficult; the intrepid duo also had to cope with turbulence, instrument failure, and ice on the wings. The flight was made in a modified Vickers Vimy bomber and won a Daily Mail aviation prizes £10,000 prize offered by Londons Daily Mail newspaper for the first non-stop flight across the Atlantic.

A few days after the flight both Alcock and Brown were honoured with a reception at Windsor Castle during which George V of the United Kingdom King George V invested them with their insignia as Order of the British Empire Knights Commanders of the Order of the British Empire.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.msim.org.uk/media/161884/captain%20jack%20alcock.pdf  format=PDF  title=Captain Jack Alcock (1892–1919)  publisher=Museum of Science & Industry, Manchester, England  accessdate=2008-04-08  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410194708/http://www.msim.org.uk/media/161884/captain%20jack%20alcock.pdf  archivedate=10 April 2008  df= }}</ref>

Alcock was present at the Science Museum (London) Science Museum in London on 15 December 1919 when the recovered Vimy aircraft was presented to the nation.
