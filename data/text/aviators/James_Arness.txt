==Military service in World War II==
Although Arness wanted to be a naval fighter pilot, he was concerned his poor eyesight would bar him. However, it was his 6 feet 7&nbsp;inches (2.01&nbsp;m) frame that ended his chances because the limit for aviators was set at 6 feet 2&nbsp;inches (1.88&nbsp;m).

Arness was sent to the U.S. Army 91st General Hospital in Clinton, Iowa, to be treated for his wounds.  After undergoing several surgeries, he was honorably discharged on January 29, 1945.

==Acting career==

After his discharge from the service, Arness entered Beloit College in Wisconsin. He began his entertainment career as a radio announcer at Minneapolis station WLOL (AM) WLOL in 1945.<ref name=article>[http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/Interviews/Arness25Nov61.pdf "TV Guide, November 1961, page 8"] Accessed March 1, 2012</ref>

Arness came to Hollywood by hitchhiking<ref>[http://www.gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/93-Hitchhiker.html "How did James Arness first come to Hollywood?"] GunsmokeNet.com</ref> and soon began acting and appearing in films. He began with RKO, who immediately changed his name from "Aurness". His film debut was as Loretta Youngs (Katie Holstrom) brother, Peter Holstrom, in The Farmers Daughter (1947 film) The Farmers Daughter. He was credited in The Farmers Daughter as Arness.<ref name=star/>

Though identified with Western movie Westerns, Arness also appeared in two science fiction films, The Thing from Another World (in which he portrayed the title character) and Them! (1954 film) Them!. He was a close friend of John Wayne and co-starred with him in Big Jim McLain, Hondo (film) Hondo, Island in the Sky (1953 film) Island in the Sky, and The Sea Chase, and starred in Gun the Man Down for Waynes company. He also starred in a 1988 TV remake of Waynes 1948 classic Red River (1948 film) Red River

An urban legend has it that John Wayne was offered the leading role of Matt Dillon in the longtime favorite television show Gunsmoke, but he turned it down, instead recommending James Arness for the role. The only part of this story that is true is that Wayne did indeed recommend Arness for the part. Wayne introduced Arness in a prologue to the first episode of Gunsmoke, in 1955.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/gunsmoke2.asp  title=Gunsmoke  work=Snopes.com  date=August 6, 2007  accessdate=June 4, 2011}}</ref> The Norwegian-German Arness had to dye his naturally blond hair darker for the role.<ref>[http://www.gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/90-Blondie.htm "James Arness is a blonde!"] GunsmokeNet.com</ref> Gunsmoke made Arness and his co-stars, Milburn Stone, Amanda Blake, Dennis Weaver, Ken Curtis, Burt Reynolds, and Buck Taylor, world-famous and would run for two decades, becoming the longest-running prime-time drama series in US television history by the end of its run in 1975.  The series season record was tied in 2010 with the final season of Law & Order and tied again in 2018 with season 20 of Law & Order: SVU.  Unlike the latter show, Gunsmoke featured its lead character in each of its 20 seasons; Gunsmoke also aired 179 more episodes, and was in the top 10 in the ratings for 11 more seasons, for a total of 13, including four consecutive seasons at number one. 
       
After Gunsmoke ended, Arness performed in Western-themed movies and television series, including How the West Was Won (TV series) How the West Was Won, and in five made-for-television Gunsmoke movies between 1987 and 1994. An exception was as a big-city police officer in a short-lived 1981-1982 series, McClains Law, co-starring with Marshall Colt. His role as mountain man Zeb Macahan in How the West Was Won made him a cult figure in many European countries, where it became even more popular than in the United States, as the series has been rebroadcast many times across Europe.

James Arness: An Autobiography was released in September 2001, with a foreword by Burt Reynolds (who had been a cast member of Gunsmoke for several years in the 1960s). Arness noted that he realized, "[I]f I was going to write a book about my life, I better do it now ... cause Im not getting any younger."<ref>[http://www.gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/98-ArnessAutobiography.htm "James Arness wrote his autobiography in 2001,"] GunsmokeNet.com</ref>
