James "Jabby" Jabara (10 October 1923 – 17 November 1966) was the first American and United States Air Force flying ace jet ace in history.<ref>{{cite news agency=United Press International United Press title=Jet Ace Out of Combat work=The New York Times, 22 May 1951 (Fee required) url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16FF39591A7B93C0AB178ED85F458585F9 accessdate=9 July 2011 date=22 May 1951}}</ref> Born in Oklahoma, he lived in Kansas where he enlisted as an aviation cadet at Fort Riley after graduating from high school. Jabara attended four flying schools in Texas before he received his pilots wings and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. Jabara flew two tours of combat duty in Europe during World War II as a North American P-51 Mustang pilot, and scored 1.5 air victories against German aircraft.

Jabara flew his first jet aircraft in 1948, the USAF Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star before transitioning to the USAF North American F-86 Sabre. Jabara used this aircraft to shoot down multiple Soviet-built Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 MiG-15 jets during the Korean War. He achieved his first confirmed air victory of the war on 3 April 1951. A month later he scored his fifth and sixth victories, making him the first American jet ace in history. He eventually scored 15 victories, giving him the title of "triple ace". Jabara was ranked as the second-highest-scoring U.S. ace of the Korean War. He received the Distinguished Service Cross (United States) Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star, Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Medal, and the Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom) British Distinguished Flying Cross for his accomplishments in combat.

Jabara next held a series of commands at various Air Force bases across the United States. He flew the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and later the Convair B-58 Hustler. In 1966, while on leave from service in Vietnam, Colonel Jabara was traveling with his family in two cars to their new home when his daughter crashed the car she was driving and he was riding in, killing them both. They were buried together at Arlington National Cemetery. In recognition of his contributions to military aviation, an airport outside of Wichita, Kansas was named in his honor. Each year the United States Air Force Academy alumni association bestows the Jabara Award upon an Academy graduate whose aerospace accomplishments demonstrate superior performance.

==Korean War==
File:JamesJabaraCockpitStanding1950s.jpg thumb left Jabara standing on his F-86 Sabre in April 1953
Before the start of the Korean War, the Korean Peninsula was split by an American-backed government at the south and a Soviet-backed opposing government at the north. Divided by the Division of Korea 38th Parallel, both the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to maintain the division until a mutual decision was made about the future of the peninsula. On 25 June 1950, North Korean troops crossed the parallel and attacked several key South Korean targets. As the United States prepared military assistance with the South Koreans, the Soviet Union also helped the North Koreans by training pilots and providing Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 MiG-15 aircraft. Jabara arrived in Korea on 13 December 1950 with the 334th Fighter Squadron 334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing. The squadron was the first F-86 Sabre unit deployed to the Fifth Air Force to counter the threat by the Soviet MiG-15s.<ref name="Blue"/> By 2 January 1951, he had flown five combat missions in F-86s and had damaged one MiG-15 Korean jet fighter in air combat.<ref>{{cite news last=Parrott first=Lindesay title=Attack Gains Some Ground On Right Flank of 8th Army work=The New York Times, 31 December 1950 (Fee required) url=https://www.nytimes.com/1950/12/31/archives/attack-gains-some-ground-on-right-flank-of-8th-army-un-troops.html accessdate=9 July 2011 date=31 December 1950}}</ref> Jabara achieved his first confirmed victory on 3 April 1951 when 12 F-86 Sabres took on 12 MiG-15s in MiG Alley, a region in northwestern North Korea.<ref name="HistAce"/> He was credited with another on 10 April, a third on 12 April,<ref>{{cite news last=The New York Times staff title=Foe Seeks to Halt Attack work=The New York Times, 13 April 1951 (Fee required) url=https://www.nytimes.com/1951/04/13/archives/8-migs-destroyed-in-great-air-fight-us-fliers-score-in-clashes-as.html accessdate=9 July 2011 date=13 April 1951}}</ref> and a fourth on 22 April.
