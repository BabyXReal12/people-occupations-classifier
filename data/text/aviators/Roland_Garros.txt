==Biography==
Eugène Adrien Roland Georges Garros<ref>[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/LH/LH067/PG/FRDAFAN83_OL1081036v007.htm culture.gouv.fr : Extract of state registers]</ref> was born in Saint-Denis, Réunion, and studied at the Lycée Janson de Sailly and HEC Paris. He started his aviation career in 1909 flying a Santos-Dumont Demoiselle Demoiselle (Dragonfly) monoplane, an aircraft that only flew well with a small lightweight pilot.  He gained Ae.C.F. licence no. 147 in July 1910. In 1911 Garros graduated to flying Blériot XI Blériot monoplanes and entered a number of European air races with this type of machine, including the 1911 Paris to Madrid air race and the Circuit of Europe (Paris-London-Paris), in which he came second.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1911/1911%20-%200640.html Judges Report in European Circuit]Flight International Flight 22 July 1911</ref>

On 4 September 1911, he set an altitude record of {{convert 3950 m ft abbr=on}}. The following year, on 6 September 1912, after Austrian aviator Philipp von Blaschke had flown to {{convert 4360 m ft abbr=on}}, he regained the height record by flying to {{convert 5610 m ft abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news title=Aviator Rises to 16,400 feet url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1912-09-07/ed-1/seq-5/ accessdate=18 October 2016 work=The Sun date=7 September 1912 location=New York page=5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=15888 publisher=FAI title=FAI Record ID#15888 accessdate=20 September 2013 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054730/http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=15888 archivedate=21 September 2013 df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=15889 publisher=FAI title=FAI Record ID#15889 accessdate=18 October 2016}}{{Dead link date=July 2018  bot=InternetArchiveBot  fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

By 1913 he had switched to flying the faster Morane-Saulnier monoplanes, and gained fame for making the first non-stop flight across the Mediterranean Sea from Fréjus in the south of France to Bizerte in Tunisia<ref>{{cite journal   date = 27 September 1913   title = Flying the Mediterranean   journal = Flight International Flight   volume = V   issue = 39   pages = 1078   url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1913/1913%20-%201052.html   accessdate = 24 September 2014}}</ref> in a Morane-Saulnier G. The following year, Garros joined the French Army in World War I French army at the outbreak of World War&nbsp;I.

===Myth of first air battle===
Reports published in August 1914 claimed Garros was involved in the "first air battle in world history" and that he had flown his plane into a Zeppelin, destroying the airship and killing its pilots and himself.<ref>{{cite web url= http://www.upi.com/Archives/1914/08/03/LONDON-Aug-3-1914-UP-The-first-air-battle-in-world-history-has-taken-place-at-Longwy-France-A-French-aviator-circled-above-a-German-aircraft-fired-down-upon-it-and-sent-it-300-feet-to-earth-The-German-aviator-was-killed/9181863545103/   publisher=United Press title=First air battles in History   date=3 August 2014}}</ref> This story was quickly contradicted by reports that Garros was alive and well in Paris.<ref name="The War in the Air">{{cite journal title=The War in the Air journal=The Literary Digest date=15 August 1914 volume=49 issue=7 page=283 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dHJFAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA283}}</ref> Such early reports maintained that an unidentified French pilot had indeed rammed and destroyed a Zeppelin,<ref name="The War in the Air"/> however, German authorities denied the story.<ref>{{cite book last1=Reynolds first1=Francis J. last2=Churchill first2=Allen L. last3=Miller first3=Francis Trevelyan title=The Story of the Great War date=1916 publisher=P.F.

===Development of interrupter gear===

In the early stages of the air war in World War I the problem of mounting a forward-firing machine gun on combat aircraft was considered by a number of individuals.  The so-called "interrupter gear" did not come into use until Anthony Fokker developed a synchronization device which had a large impact on air combat; however, Garros also had a significant role in the process of achieving this goal.<ref>Volker, Hank. "Synchronizers Parts 1–6" in WORLD WAR I AERO. (1992–1996), World War I Aeroplanes, Inc. Part 1, pp. 49–50</ref>

As a reconnaissance pilot with the Escadrille 26 Escadrille MS26, Garros visited the Morane-Saulnier Works<ref name="van Wyngarden">{{cite book last=van Wyngarden first=Greg  title=Early German Aces of World War I url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G94svgAACAAJ year=2006 publisher=Bloomsbury USA isbn=978-1-84176-997-4}}</ref> in December 1914.  Saulniers work on metal deflector wedges attached to propeller blades was taken forward by Garros; he eventually had a workable installation fitted to his Morane-Saulnier Type L aircraft. The Aero Club of America awarded him a medal for this invention three years later.<ref>{{cite news  author=  title=Aero Club Honors Garros.

On 18 April 1915, either Garross fuel line clogged or, by other accounts, his aircraft was downed by ground fire, and he glided to a landing on the German side of the lines. Garros failed to destroy his aircraft completely before being taken prisoner: most significantly, the gun and armoured propeller remained intact.<ref name="van Wyngarden"/> Legend has it that after examining the plane, German aircraft engineers, led by Fokker, designed the improved interrupter gear system. In fact the work on Fokkers system had been going for at least six months before Garross aircraft fell into their hands.<ref name="Woodman1989">{{cite book last=Woodman first=Harry  title=Early Aircraft Armament: The Aeroplane and the Gun Up to 1918 url={{google books id=sq8WAAAAYAAJ plainurl=yes page=181 keywords=garros}} year=1989 publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press isbn=978-0-87474-994-6 p=181}}</ref> With the advent of the interrupter gear the tables were turned on the Allies, with Fokkers planes shooting down many Allied aircraft, leading to what became known as the Fokker Scourge.<ref name="Robertson2003">{{cite book last=Robertson first=Linda Raine  title=The Dream of Civilized Warfare: World War I Flying Aces and the American Imagination url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IEazJzZPaGMC&pg=PA103 year=2003 publisher=U of Minnesota Press isbn=978-0-8166-4270-0 page=103}}</ref>

===After internment in a POW camp===
Garros finally managed to escape from a prisoner-of-war camp POW camp in Germany on 14 February 1918, after several attempts, and rejoined the French army.<ref>{{cite news  author=  title=Garros To Train Anew In The Art Of Air Warfare.

===Death===
On 5 October 1918, he was shot down and killed near Vouziers, Ardennes, a month before the end of the war and one day before his 30th birthday.<ref>{{cite news  author=  title=Garros Is Killed, Berlin Reports.

==Legacy==
Garros is erroneously called the worlds first fighter ace. In fact, he shot down only four aircraft; the definition of "fighter ace ace" is five or more victories. The honour of becoming the first ace went to another French airman, Adolphe Pégoud, who had six victories early in the war.<ref name="Franks1992">{{cite book last=Franks first=Norman L.

The international airport of La Réunion, Roland Garros Airport, is also named after him.
There is a monument to Garros in Bizerte at the site of his landing, which is called "Roland Garros Plaza".<ref>{{Cite web  url=https://lepetitjournal.com/tunis/actualites/centenaire-bizerte-fete-roland-garros-51755  title=CENTENAIRE – Bizerte fête Roland Garros  date=16 September 2013  website=Le Petit Journal  language=fr  access-date=16 April 2018 df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The French car manufacturer Peugeot commissioned a Roland Garros limited edition version of its Peugeot 205 205 model in celebration of the tennis tournament that bears his name. The model included special paint and leather interior.
