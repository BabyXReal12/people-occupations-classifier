Jean Gardner Batten, Order of British Empire CBE, Order of the Southern Cross OSC (15 September 1909 – 22 November 1982) was a New Zealand Pilot (aeronautics) aviatrix. Born in Rotorua, she became the best-known New Zealander of the 1930s, internationally, by making a number of record-breaking solo flights across the world. She made the first-ever solo flight from England to New Zealand in 1936.

==Early life==
Jane Batten (named "Jane" at birth, her name soon metamorphosed into "Jean")<ref name=":0">{{Cite web url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/people/jean-batten title=Jean Batten {{!}} NZHistory, New Zealand history online website=www.nzhistory.net.nz access-date=2016-09-17}}</ref> was born to Frederick Batten, a dental surgeon, and Nellie (Ellen) Batten Blackmore <ref>Birth Certificate: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/142449034/jean-gardner-batten#view-photo=144595151 
</ref>(who would become her strong supporter in her choice of a pilot career). She had two older brothers.<ref name=":0" /> In 1913 the family moved to Auckland. In 1924 Batten was enrolled into a girls boarding college in Remuera in Auckland where she studied ballet and piano. Though she was a gifted pianist, at age 18 she determined to become a pilot after the Australian pilot Charles Kingsford Smith took her for a flight in his Southern Cross (aircraft) Southern Cross airplane.

==Early flying==
In 1929, she and her mother moved to England, to join the London Aeroplane Club. She took her first solo flight in 1930 and gained private and commercial licences by 1932,  borrowing £500 from Fred Truman, a New Zealand pilot serving in the Royal Air Force who wanted to marry her, to fund the 100 hours flying time required. After completing her "B" license in December 1932, she left Truman and turned to Victor Dorée, who borrowed £400 from his mother to buy Batten a de Havilland DH.60 Moth Gipsy Moth biplane. According to NZ History Online, "Raising money by taking advantage of her relationships with men was a theme that continued throughout her flying career."<ref name=":0" />

Batten made two unsuccessful attempts to beat Amy Johnsons time to Australia. In April 1933 she hit two sandstorms before the engine failed, and wrecked the aircraft. She crash-landed near Karachi. Returning to London she could not persuade Dorée to buy her another aircraft, so she turned to the Castrol oil company, which bought her a second-hand Gipsy Moth for £240. She made another attempt in April 1934, but ran out of fuel at night on the outskirts of Rome. Crashing into a maze of radio masts, she nearly severed her lip. The plane was repaired and she flew it back to London, where she borrowed the lower wings from the aircraft of her fiancé, stockbroker Edward Walter, for a third attempt.<ref name="DNZB"/>

==Breaking records==
In May 1934, Batten successfully flew solo from England to Australia in the Gipsy Moth. Her trip of 14 days and 22 hours beat the existing England-to-Australia record of English aviatrix Amy Johnson by over four days.<ref name="DNZB">{{cite web url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/4B13 title=Batten, Jean Gardner (1909–1982) last=Mackersey first=Ian work=Dictionary of New Zealand Biography publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> For this achievement and for subsequent record-breaking flights, she was awarded the Harmon Trophy three times (1935, 1936, 1937). She also received an endorsement contract with Castrol oil. Battens book about her trip, Solo Flight, was published by Jackson and OSullivan Ltd in 1934. Batten took a boat to New Zealand with the Gipsy Moth (which could not have flown across the Tasman Sea) and made a six-week aerial tour there before returning to England.

After her first Australia flight Batten bought a Percival Gull Percival Gull Six monoplane, G-ADPR, which was named Jean. In 1935 she set a world record flying from England to Brazil in the Percival Gull, for which she was presented the Order of the Southern Cross, the first person other than Royalty to be so honoured.<ref>[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BatMyL.html My Life], by Jean Batten, George G. Harrap & Co. Ltd., 1938</ref> In 1936 she set another world record with a solo flight from England to New Zealand. At her birthplace of Rotorua she was honored by local Māori people Māori, as she had been after the 1934 journey. She was given a chief’s feather cloak and given the title Hine-o-te-Rangi and Papa Rangi – "Daughter of the Skies".

Because of her striking looks, her glamorous appearance at receptions (she always took a white silk dress with her on her record-breaking flights, and repaired her lipstick before exiting her aircraft), and her later reclusive ways, Batten became known as the "Greta Garbo Garbo of the skies".{{source? date=October 2016}}

==Honours==
Batten was created Order of the British Empire Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1936, and she was also given the Cross of Chevalier of the French Légion dhonneur Legion of Honour that year. Also in 1936, for the second successive year, Batten was again awarded the Royal Aero Clubs Britannia Trophy for most meritorious performance in aviation during the previous year.

In 1938 she was awarded the medal of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, aviations highest honour; she was the first woman to receive the medal.  Throughout the 1930s she was very social and made many friends with other aviators internationally, as she described in her autobiography.

==Life after flying exploits==

World War II ended Battens flying adventures. Her Gull was commissioned to active service and Batten was not permitted to fly it. During the war she was involved in campaigns giving lectures in England to raise money for guns and aeroplanes, but her flying days were over. After the war she retired from public life except for a few anniversary appearances.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/jean_batten_bio.html title=Jean Batten Bio (compilation) publisher=Monash University Centre for Telecommunications and Information Engineering accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref>

Batten became a recluse and lived in several places around the world with her mother until her mothers death in 1965. In 1977 she was guest of honour at the opening of the Aviation Pioneers Pavilion at Aucklands Museum of Transport and Technology, after which she returned to her home in Spain.<ref>[http://www.nzedge.com/heroes/batten.html Jean Batten Hine-o-te-Rangi: Daughter of the skies]</ref> In 1982 she was bitten by a dog on the island of Majorca.

She was buried under her middle name, Gardner, in a paupers grave in Majorca in 1983 – she had been there for only a week and her identity unknown – which was not discovered until five years later.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/the-flying-ace-known-as-the-greta-garbo-of-the-skies-who-ended-in-a-paupers-grave-34824642.html title=The flying ace known as the Greta Garbo of the skies who ended in a paupers grave - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk access-date=2016-09-17}}</ref> Thus the world, and her relatives, did not learn of her passing until September 1987.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/4b13/batten-jean-gardner title=Batten, Jean Gardner   1909–1982 last=Mackersey first=Ian work=Dictionary of New Zealand Biography.

Battens autobiography, My Life, was published by George G. Harrap in 1938 and is available online at the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre, part of the Victoria University of Wellington Library. An extended version was printed under the title Alone in the Sky by N.Z. Technical books in 1979.  In October 2008 a musical, Garbo of the Skies written by Paul Andersen-Gardiner and Rebekah Hornblow had its inaugural performance in Opunake by the Opunake Players at the Lakeside Playhouse. It was based on Ian Mackerseys biography.
