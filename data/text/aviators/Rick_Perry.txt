===Crime===
Perrys campaigns for lieutenant governor and governor focused on a Law and order (politics) tough stance on crime. He has supported block grants for crime programs.<ref name=NGA10>{{cite web url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Notebook/Note_01-NGA10.htm title=Public Notes on 01-NGA10 publisher=On The Issues date=September 14, 2001 accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref>

Jeff L.

Perry commuted the death sentence of Kenneth Foster, who was convicted of murder despite evidence that he was only present at the scene of the crime. Foster was convicted under a Texas law that makes co-conspirators liable in certain cases of homicide. In this case, it tied Foster to the triggerman. Perry raised doubts about the law and urged the legislature to re-examine the issue. "I believe the right and just decision is to commute Fosters sentence from the death penalty to life imprisonment", Perry said in a statement at the time.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/31/us/31execute.html?_r=1& newspaper=The New York Times title=Governor Commutes Sentence in Texas date=August 31, 2007}}</ref>

Perry also refused to grant a stay of execution in the case of Cameron Todd Willingham even though an investigation by the Texas Forensic Science Commission determined parts of the original investigation may not have looked at all of the evidence correctly. Perry called Willingham a "monster" and later replaced the chairman of the Science Commission.<ref>{{cite news last1=Thornton first1=Paul title=Cameron Todd Willinghams ghost wont stop haunting Rick Perry url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-cameron-todd-willingham-rick-perry-execution-20140806-story.html newspaper=Los Angeles Times date=August 6, 2014 accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref>

===Infrastructure===
In 2002, Perry proposed the Trans-Texas Corridor, a $175 billion transportation network that would include a 4,000-mile network of highways, rail, and utility lines and would be funded by private investors.
