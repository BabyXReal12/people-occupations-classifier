Eugene Luther Gore Vidal ({{IPAc-en v ᵻ ˈ d ɑː l}}; born Eugene Louis Vidal; October 3, 1925 – July 31, 2012) was an American writer and public intellectual known for his Patrician (ancient Rome) patrician manner, epigrammatic wit, and polished style of writing.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.loc.gov/nls/about/organization/standards-guidelines/uvwx/#v  title=NLS Other Writings publisher=Loc.gov date=February 2011  accessdate=November 7, 2011  quote=Vidal, Gore (və-DÄL)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.bookbrowse.com/biographies/index.cfm?author_number=497 title=Gore Vidal Biography publisher=BookBrowse  date=July 25, 2011  accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>

Vidal was born to a political family; his maternal grandfather, Thomas Pryor Gore, served as United States senator from Oklahoma (1907–1921 and 1931–1937). He was a Democratic Party (United States) Democratic Party politician who twice sought elected office; first to the United States House of Representatives (New York, 1960), then to the U.S. Senate (California, 1982).<ref name="Vidal, Gore 1995 p. 439">Vidal, Gore. Palimpsest: A Memoir Random House, New York (1995) p. 439.</ref>

As a political commentator and essayist, Vidals principal subject was the history of the United States and its society, especially how the militaristic foreign policy reduced the country to a American imperialism decadent empire.<ref>Wiener, Jon. I Told You So: Gore Vidal Talks Politics Counter Point Press; Berkeley (2012) pp. 54–55</ref> His political and cultural essays were published in The Nation, the New Statesman, the New York Review of Books, and Esquire (magazine) Esquire magazines. As a public intellectual, Gore Vidals topical debates on sex, politics, and religion with other intellectuals and writers occasionally turned into quarrels with the likes of William F. Buckley Jr. and Norman Mailer. Vidal thought all men and women are potentially bisexual, so he rejected the adjectives "homosexual" and "heterosexual" when used as nouns, as inherently false terms used to classify and control people in society.<ref>Wieder, Judy. Celebrity: The Advocate Interviews Advocate Books (2001) p. 127.</ref>

As a novelist Vidal explored the nature of corruption in public and private life. His polished and erudite style of narration readily evoked the time and place of his stories, and perceptively delineated the psychology of his characters.<ref>Murphy, Bruce.

AD 66), Juvenal (AD 60–140), and Apuleius (Floruit fl. ca. AD 155); and from the post-Renaissance: Thomas Love Peacock (1785–1866) and George Meredith (1828–1909). More recent literary figures by whom his work was influenced include: Marcel Proust (1871–1922), Henry James (1843–1916) and Evelyn Waugh (1903–66).<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web  url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3917/the-art-of-fiction-no-50-gore-vidal title=Paris Review – The Art of Fiction No. 50, Gore Vidal publisher=}}</ref> The cultural critic Harold Bloom has written that Gore Vidal believed that his sexuality had denied him full recognition from the literary community in the United States but Bloom contends that such limited recognition owed more to Vidal writing in the unfashionable, plot-orientated genre of historical fiction, than with whom Vidal shared a pillow.<ref name="Bloom1994">{{cite book  last=Bloom first=Harold title=The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_-QzKinSsz0C accessdate=August 1, 2012 year=1994 publisher=Riverhead Books  isbn=978-1-57322-514-4  page=20}}</ref> In 2009, the Man of Letters Gore Vidal was named honorary president of the American Humanist Association.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.atheists.org/gore-vidal-death-legend  title=Gore Vidal: The Death of a Legend &#124; American Atheists  publisher=Atheists.org  date=August 1, 2012  accessdate=August 5, 2012  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804052134/http://www.atheists.org/gore-vidal-death-legend  archivedate=August 4, 2012}}</ref><!-- dead link --><ref name=Freethinker0812>{{cite web  last=Duke first=Barry url=http://freethinker.co.uk/2012/08/01/farewell-gore-vidal-gay-atheist-extraordinary/ title=Farewell Gore Vidal, Gay Atheist Extraordinary publisher=Freethinker.co.uk  date=August 1, 2012 accessdate=December 18, 2015}}</ref>

In the 1960s, Vidal published Julian (novel) Julian (1964), about the Roman Emperor Julian (emperor) Julian the Apostate (r. A.D. 361–363), who sought to reinstate polytheism polytheistic paganism when Christianity threatened the cultural integrity of the Roman Empire, Washington, D.C. (novel) Washington, D.C.

Roosevelt and Myra Breckinridge (1968), a satire of the American movie business, by way of a school of dramatic arts owned by a transsexual woman, the eponymous anti-heroine.

After publishing the plays Weekend (play) Weekend (1968) and An Evening With Richard Nixon (1972) and the novel Two Sisters: A Novel in the Form of a Memoir (1970), Vidal concentrated upon the essay and developed two types of fiction. The first type is about American history, novels specifically about the nature of national politics.<ref name="NYTimes -7-jul-1970">{{cite news  author=Leonard, John authorlink=John Leonard (critic) url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/01/home/vidal-sisters.html title=Not Enough Blood, Not Enough Gore work=The New York Times date=July 7, 1970 accessdate=October 30, 2008}}</ref> About those historical novels, the critic Harold Bloom said that "Vidals imagination of American politics ... is so powerful as to compel awe". The historical novels formed the seven-book series, Narratives of Empire: (i) Burr (novel) Burr (1973), (ii) 1876 (novel) 1876 (1976), (iii) Lincoln (novel) Lincoln (1984), (iv) Empire (Vidal novel) Empire (1987), (v) Hollywood (Vidal novel) Hollywood (1990), (vi) Washington, D.C. (novel) Washington, D.C. (1967) and (vii) The Golden Age (Gore Vidal novel) The Golden Age (2000). Besides U.S. history, Vidal also explored and analyzed the history of the ancient world, specifically the Axial age Axial Age (800–200 B.C.), with the novel Creation (novel) Creation (1981). The novel was published without four chapters that were part of the manuscript he submitted to the publisher; years later, Vidal restored the chapters to the text and re-published the novel Creation in 2002.

The second type of fiction is the topical satire, such as Myron (novel) Myron (1974) the sequel to Myra Breckinridge; Kalki (novel) Kalki (1978), about the end of the world and the consequent ennui; Duluth (novel) Duluth (1983), an Parallel universe (fiction) alternate universe story; Live from Golgotha: The Gospel according to Gore Vidal Live from Golgotha (1992), about the adventures of Timothy, Bishop of Macedonia, in the early days of Christianity and Smithsonian Institution (novel) The Smithsonian Institution (1998), a time-travel story.

====Non-fiction====
In the U.S., Gore Vidal is often considered an essayist, rather than a novelist.<ref>{{cite news  first=Deborah  last=Solomon  title=Literary Lion  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/magazine/15wwln-Q4-t.html?ref=magazine  work= The New York Times Magazine  date=June 15, 2008  accessdate=June 29, 2008}}</ref> Even the occasionally hostile literary critic, such as Martin Amis, admitted that "Essays are what he is good at ... [Vidal] is learned, funny, and exceptionally clear-sighted. Even his blind spots are illuminating."

For six decades, Vidal applied himself to socio-political, sexual, historical and literary subjects. In the essay anthology Armageddon (1987) Vidal explored the intricacies of power (political and cultural) in the contemporary U.S. His criticism of the incumbent U.S. President, Ronald Reagan, as a "triumph of the embalmers art" communicated that Reagans provincial worldview, and that of his administrations, was out of date and inadequate to the geopolitics geopolitical realities of the world in the late twentieth century. In 1993, Vidal won the National Book Award for Nonfiction for the anthology United States (essays) United States: Essays 1952–92 (1993).<ref name=nba1993>[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1993.html "National Book Awards&nbsp;– 1993"]. National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-12.<br />(With acceptance speech by Vidal, read by Harry Evans.)</ref>

According to the citation, "Whatever his subject, he addresses it with an artists resonant appreciation, a scholars conscience and the persuasive powers of a great essayist."<ref>{{cite web  title=United States url=https://www.amazon.com/United-States-Gore-Vidal/dp/product-description/0767908066 work=amazon.com accessdate=November 27, 2013}}</ref>

In 2000 Vidal published the collection of essays, The Last Empire, then such self-described "pamphlets" as Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace, Dreaming War: Blood for Oil and the Cheney-Bush Junta and Imperial America, critiques of American expansionism, the military-industrial complex, the national security state and the Presidency of George W. Bush George W. Bush administration. Vidal also wrote a historical essay about the U.S. founding fathers, Inventing a Nation. In 1995, he published a memoir Palimpsest (memoir) Palimpsest and in 2006 its follow-up volume, Point to Point Navigation. Earlier that year, Vidal had published Clouds and Eclipses: The Collected Short Stories.

Because of his matter-of-fact treatment of same-sex relations in such books as The City and The Pillar, Vidal is often seen as an early champion of sexual liberation.<ref>[http://www.consulfrance-losangeles.org/spip.php?article547 Décoration de lécrivain Gore Vidal].  {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013002425/http://www.consulfrance-losangeles.org/spip.php?article547  date=October 13, 2008 }}</ref> In the September 1969 edition of Esquire, for example, Vidal wrote

{{quote We are all bisexual to begin with. That is a fact of our condition. And we are all responsive to sexual stimuli from our own as well as from the opposite sex. Certain societies at certain times, usually in the interest of maintaining the baby supply, have discouraged homosexuality. Other societies, particularly militaristic ones, have exalted it. But regardless of tribal taboos, homosexuality is a constant fact of the human condition and it is not a sickness, not a sin, not a crime&nbsp;... despite the best efforts of our puritan tribe to make it all three.

====Screenplays====
In 1956, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer hired Gore Vidal as a screenwriter screenplay writer with a four-year employment contract. In 1958, the director William Wyler required a script doctor to rewrite the screenplay for Ben-Hur (1959 film) Ben-Hur (1959), originally written by Karl Tunberg. As one of several script doctors assigned to the project, Vidal rewrote portions of the script to resolve ambiguities of character motivation, specifically to clarify the enmity between the Jewish protagonist, Judah Ben-Hur and the Roman antagonist, Messala, who had been close boyhood friends. In exchange for rewriting the Ben-Hur screenplay, on location in Italy, Vidal negotiated the early termination (at the two-year mark) of his four-year contract with MGM.<ref>Vidal, Gore. Palimpsest: A Memoir Random House, New York (1995) pp. 301–307.</ref>

Thirty-six years later, in the documentary film The Celluloid Closet (1995), Vidal explained that Messalas failed attempt at resuming their homosexual, boyhood relationship motivated the ostensibly political enmity between Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) and Messala (Stephen Boyd), that Boyd was aware of the homosexual subtext to the scene and that the director, the producer and the screenplay writer agreed to keep Heston ignorant of the subtext, lest he refuse to play the scene.<ref>Vidal, Gore. Palimpsest: A Memoir Random House, New York (1995) pp. 306–306.</ref> In turn, on learning of that script-doctor explanation, Charlton Heston said that Gore Vidal had contributed little to the script of Ben Hur.<ref>{{cite news  title=A Commanding Presence: Actor Charlton Heston Sets His Epic Career in Stone – or At Least on Paper  author=Mick LaSalle  publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle  date=October 2, 1995  page=E1}}</ref> Despite Vidals script-doctor resolution of the characters motivations, the Screen Writers Guild assigned formal screenwriter-credit to Karl Tunberg, in accordance with the WGA screenwriting credit system, which favored the "original author" of a screenplay, rather than the writer of the filmed screenplay.<ref>{{cite news  title=Gore Vidal, Aloof in Art and Life  author=Ned Rorem  publisher=Chicago Sun-Times  date=December 12, 1999  page=18S}}</ref>

Two plays, The Best Man (play) The Best Man: A Play about Politics (1960, made into a The Best Man (1964 film) film in 1964) and Visit to a Small Planet (1955) were theatre and movie successes; Vidal occasionally returned to the movie business, and wrote historically accurate teleplays and screenplays about subjects important to him. Two such movies are the cowboy movie Billy the Kid (1989 film) Billy the Kid (1989), about William H. Bonney a gunman in the Lincoln County War (1878), occurred in the New Mexico territory and later an outlaw in the Western frontier of the U.S. and the Roman Empire movie Caligula (film) Caligula (1979), from which Vidal had his screenwriter credit removed, because the producer, Bob Guccione, the director, Tinto Brass and the leading actor, Malcolm McDowell, rewrote the script and added extra sex and violence to increase the commercial success of a movie based upon the life of the Roman Emperor Caligula (AD 12–41), which is the fourth biography in The Twelve Caesars (AD 121), by Suetonius.<ref name="Time-3-jan-1977">"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947822,00.html Show Business: Will the Real Caligula Stand Up?]", Time January 3, 1977.</ref>

In 1982, he campaigned against Jerry Brown, the incumbent Governor of California, in the Democratic primary election for the U.S. Senate; Vidal forecast accurately that the opposing Republican candidate would win the election.<ref name="vidal_correx_july_2011">[https://web.archive.org/web/20120402190800/http://www.gorevidalnow.com/in-which-gore-vidal-corrects-his-wikipedia-page/ Archived from gorevidalnow.com], in which Gore Vidal corrects his Wikipedia page</ref> That foray into senatorial politics is the subject of the documentary film Gore Vidal: The Man Who Said No (1983), directed by Gary Conklin.

In a 2001 article, "The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh", Gore undertook to discover why domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh perpetrated the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. He concluded that McVeigh (a politically disillusioned U.S. Army veteran of the Gulf War First Iraq War, 1990–91) had destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building as an act of revenge for the FBIs Waco massacre (1993) at the Branch Davidian Compound in Texas, believing that the U.S. government had mistreated Americans in the same manner that he believed that the U.S. Army had mistreated the Iraqis.<ref>Gore Vidal, [http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2001/09/mcveigh200109?printable=true&currentPage=all "The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh"].

In Dreaming War: Blood for Oil and the Cheney-Bush Junta (2002), Vidal drew parallels about how the U.S. enters wars and said that President Franklin D. Roosevelt provoked Imperial Japan to attack the U.S. to justify the American entry to the Second World War (1939–45). He contended that Roosevelt had advance knowledge of the dawn-raid attack on Attack on Pearl Harbor Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941).<ref>Gore Vidal, "Three Lies to Rule By" and "Japanese Intentions in the Second World War", from Dreaming War: Blood for Oil and the Cheney-Bush Junta, New York, 2002, {{ISBN 1-56025-502-1}}</ref> In the documentary Why We Fight (2005 film) Why We Fight (2005), Vidal said that, during the final months of the war, the Japanese had tried to surrender: "They were trying to surrender all that summer, but Harry Truman Truman wouldnt listen, because Truman wanted to drop the bombs.... To show off. To frighten Stalin. To change the balance of power (international relations) balance of power in the world. To declare war on communism.

As a public intellectual, Vidal criticized what he viewed as political harm to the nation and the voiding of the citizens rights through the passage of the Patriot act USA Patriot Act (2001) during the Presidency of George W.

In May 2007, while discussing 9/11 conspiracy theories that might explain the "who?" and the "why?" of the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., Vidal said

{{quote Im not a conspiracy theorist, Im a conspiracy analyst. Everything the Bushites touch is screwed up. They could never have pulled off 9/11, even if they wanted to. Even if they longed to.

In a September 30, 2009 interview with The Times of London, Vidal said that there soon would be a dictatorship in the U.S. The newspaper emphasized that Vidal, described as "the Grand Old Man of American belles-lettres", claimed that America is rotting away – and to not expect Barack Obama to save the country and the nation from imperial decay. In the interview, also up-dated his views of his life, the U.S., and other political subjects.<ref>[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/article1855681.ece Interview] The Times September 30, 2009</ref> Gore had earlier described what he saw as the political and cultural rot in the U.S. in his essay, "The State of the Union" (1975),

{{quote There is only one party in the United States, the Property Party ... and it has two right wings: Republican and Democrat. Republicans are a bit stupider, more rigid, more doctrinaire in their laissez-faire capitalism laissez-faire capitalism than the Democrats, who are cuter, prettier, a bit more corrupt – until recently ... and more willing than the Republicans to make small adjustments when the poor, the black, the anti-imperialists get out of hand.

In the American Conservative article, "My Pen Pal Gore Vidal" (2012), Bill Kauffman reported that Gore Vidals favorite U.S. politician, during his lifetime, was Huey Long (1893–1935), the Populism#United States populist Governor (1928–32) and Senator (1932–35) from Louisiana, who also had perceived the essential, one-party nature of U.S. politics and who was assassinated by a lone gunman.<ref>Kauffman, Bill (September 14, 2012) [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/my-pen-pal-gore-vidal/ My Pen Pal Gore Vidal], The American Conservative</ref>

Despite that, Vidal said, "I think of myself as a conservative", with a proprietary attitude towards the U.S. "My family helped start [this country] ... and weve been in political life ... since the 1690s, and I have a very possessive sense about this country".<ref>Real Time With Bill Maher, Season 7, Episode 149, April 10, 2009</ref><ref>Gore Vidal, "Sexually Speaking: Collected Sexual Writings", Cleis Press, 1999.</ref> Based upon that background of populism, from 1970 to 1972, Vidal was a chairman of the Peoples Party (United States, 1970s) Peoples Party of the United States.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.wtp.org/archive/transcripts/gore_vidal.html  title=Gore Vidal  publisher=Wtp.org  date=  accessdate=October 20, 2008}}</ref> In 1971, he endorsed the consumer-rights advocate Ralph Nader for U.S. president in the United States presidential election, 1972 1972 election.<ref>Vidal, Gore [http://www.esquire.com/features/gore-vidal-archive/best-man-1972 The Best Man/72] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105221536/http://www.esquire.com/features/gore-vidal-archive/best-man-1972  date=January 5, 2010 }}, Esquire (magazine) Esquire</ref> In 2004, he endorsed the Democrat Dennis Kucinich in his candidacy for the U.S. presidency (in 2004), because Kucinich was "the most eloquent of the lot" of presidential candidates, from either the Republican or the Democratic parties and that Kucinich was "very much a favorite out there, in the amber fields of grain".<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.thenation.com/article/dennis-kucinich  title=Dennis Kucinich  work=The Nation date=November 8, 2007 accessdate=March 25, 2012}}</ref>

====Cultural politics====

The Truman Capote–Vidal feud<br />
In 1975 Vidal sued Truman Capote for slander over the accusation that he had been thrown out of the White House for being drunk, putting his arm around the first lady and then insulting Mrs. Kennedys mother.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/01/books/gore-vidal-elegant-writer-dies-at-86.html title=Gore Vidal Dies at 86; Prolific, Elegant, Acerbic Writer date=August 1, 2012 work=The New York Times}}</ref> Said Capote of Vidal at the time: "Im always sad about Gore – very sad that he has to breathe every day".<ref name="people.com">{{cite web  url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20073969,00.html title=Sued by Gore Vidal and Stung by Lee Radziwill, a Wounded Truman Capote Lashes Back at the Dastardly Duo publisher=}}</ref> Mutual friend George Plimpton observed "Theres no venom like Capotes when hes on the prowl – and Gores too, I dont know what division the feud should be in."

The Buckley-Vidal feud<br />
In 1968, the ABC News ABC television network hired the liberal Gore Vidal and the conservative William F. Buckley, Jr. as political analysts of the presidential-nomination conventions of the Republican and Democratic parties.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kloman/debates.html  title=Political Animals: Vidal, Buckley and the 68 Conventions  last1=Kloman  first1=Harry  publisher=University of Pittsburgh  accessdate=November 2, 2009}}</ref> Their commentaries led to Buckley threatening to assault Vidal. After days of bickering, their debates degraded to vitriolic ad hominem attacks. In discussing the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests, the public intellectuals argued about the freedom of speech freedom-of-speech-right of American political protesters to display a Viet Cong flag, when Vidal told Buckley to "shut up a minute", after Buckley had interrupted him and in response to Buckleys reference to "pro-Nazi" protesters, said "As far as Im concerned, the only sort of crypto-fascism pro-crypto-Nazi I can think of is yourself". Buckley replied, "Now listen, you queer. Stop calling me a crypto-Nazi, or Ill sock you in the goddamn face, and youll stay plastered". Their quarrel was interrupted by the ABC News anchorman-moderator Howard K. Smith and they returned to providing the political analysis and commentary for which they had been hired.<ref name="vidal_correx_july_2011"/><ref>{{cite web  title=William Buckley/Gore Vidal Debate url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYymnxoQnf8 accessdate=August 3, 2012}}</ref> Later, William F. Buckley said he regretted having called Gore Vidal "a queer" yet said that Vidal was an "evangelist for bisexuality".<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898542,00.html  title=Feuds: Wasted Talent  work=Time  date=August 22, 1969  accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>

In 1969, in Esquire magazine, Buckley continued his cultural feud with Vidal in the essay "On Experiencing Gore Vidal" (August 1969), in which he portrayed Vidal as an Apologia apologist for homosexuality; Buckley said, "The man who, in his essays, proclaims the normalcy of his affliction [i.e., homosexuality], and in his art the desirability of it, is not to be confused with the man who bears his sorrow quietly. The addict is to be pitied and even respected, not the pusher". The essay is collected in The Governor Listeth: A Book of Inspired Political Revelations (1970), an anthology of Buckleys writings from the time.

Vidal riposted in Esquire with the essay "A Distasteful Encounter with William F. Buckley, Jr." (September 1969) and said that Buckley was "anti-black", "anti-semitism anti-semitic" and a "warmonger".<ref name="esquire_sept_1969"/> Buckley sued Vidal for libel; at trial, the judge said, that the "court must conclude that Vidals comments, in these paragraphs, meet the minimal standard of fair comment. The inferences made by Vidal, from Buckleys [earlier editorial] statements, cannot be said to be completely unreasonable".{{citation needed date=February 2008}}

The feud continued in Esquire and Vidal implied that in 1944, William F. Buckley Jr. and unnamed siblings had vandalized a Protestant church in Sharon, Connecticut (the Buckley family hometown) after the wife of a pastor had sold a house to a Jewish family. Buckley again sued Vidal and Esquire for libel and Vidal filed a counter-claim for libel against Buckley, citing Buckleys characterization of Myra Breckinridge (1968) as a pornography pornographic novel.<ref>{{cite court  litigants=Buckley v.

On the contrary, it clearly states that we published that article because we believed that Vidal had a right to assert his opinions, even though we did not share them".

In Gore Vidal: A Biography (1999), Fred Kaplan (biographer) Fred Kaplan said that "The court had not sustained Buckleys case against Esquire ... [that] the court had not ruled that Vidals article was defamatory. It had ruled that the case would have to go to trial in order to determine, as a matter of fact, whether or not it was defamatory. The cash value of the settlement with Esquire represented only Buckleys legal expenses... ."

In 2003, William F. Buckley Jr. resumed his complaint of having been libelled by Gore Vidal, with the publication of the anthology Esquires Big Book of Great Writing (2003), which included Vidals essay, "A Distasteful Encounter with William F. Buckley, Jr." (1969). Again, the offended Buckley filed lawsuit for libel and Esquire magazine again settled Buckleys claim with $55,000–65,000 for the fees of his attorney and $10,000 for personal damages suffered by Buckley.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kloman/debates.html  title=Political Animals: Vidal, Buckley and the 68 Conventions  last1=Kloman  first1=Harry  publisher=University of Pittsburgh  accessdate=December 28, 2016}}</ref>

In the obituary "RIP WFB – in Hell" (March 20, 2008), Vidal remembered his nemesis William F. Buckley Jr., who had died on February 27, 2008.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20080320_gore_vidal_speaks_seriously_ill_of_the_dead/  title=Reports&nbsp;– Gore Vidal Speaks Seriously Ill of the Dead  publisher=Truthdig  date=March 20, 2008  accessdate=January 22, 2009}}</ref> Later, in the interview "Literary Lion: Questions for Gore Vidal" (June 15, 2008), the New York Times reporter Deborah Solomon asked Vidal, "How did you feel, when you heard that Buckley died this year?" Vidal responded

National self-preservation<br />
In 1999, in the lecture "The Folly of Mass Immigration", presented in Dublin, Vidal said

{{quote A characteristic of our present chaos is the dramatic migration of tribes. They are on the move from east to west, from south to north. Liberal tradition requires that borders must always be open to those in search of safety, or even the pursuit of happiness.

If the Norwegians say that, all in all, they would rather not take them in, is this to be considered racism? I think not. It is simply self-preservation, the first law of species.

The Polanski rape case<br />
In The Atlantic magazine interview, "A Conversation with Gore Vidal" (October 2009), by John Meroney, Vidal spoke about topical and cultural matters of U.S. society. Asked his opinion about the arrest of the film director Roman Polanski, in Switzerland, in September 2009, in response to an extradition request by U.S. authorities, for having fled the U.S. in 1978 to avoid jail for the statutory rape of a thirteen-year-old girl in Hollywood, Vidal said, "I really dont give a fuck. Look, am I going to sit and weep every time a young hooker feels as though shes been taken advantage of?"

Asked for elaboration, Vidal explained the cultural temper of the U.S. and of the Hollywood movie business in the 1970s

{{quote The [news] media cant get anything straight. Plus, theres usually an anti-Semitic and homophobia anti-fag thing going on with the press – lots of crazy things. The idea that this girl was in her communion dress, a little angel, all in white, being raped by this awful Jew Polacko – thats what people were calling him – well, the story is totally different now [2009] from what it was then [1970s]... . Anti-Semitism got poor Polanski. He was also a foreigner. He did not subscribe to American values, in the least. To [his persecutors], that seemed vicious and unnatural.

In response to Vidals opinion about the decades-old Polanski rape case, a spokeswoman for the organization Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, Barbara Dorris, said, "People should express their outrage, by refusing to buy any of his books", called Vidal a "mean-spirited buffoon" and said that, although "a boycott wouldnt hurt Vidal financially", it would "cause anyone else, with such callous views, to keep his mouth shut, and [so] avoid rubbing salt into the already deep [psychological] wounds of (the victims)" of sexual abuse.<ref>{{cite news  title=Gore Vidal rips Roman Polanski rape victim as hooker url=http://www.bostonherald.com/inside_track/celebrity_news/2009/11/gore_vidal_rips_roman_polanski_rape_victim_%E2%80%98hooker%E2%80%99 work=Boston Herald date=November 1, 2009}}</ref>
