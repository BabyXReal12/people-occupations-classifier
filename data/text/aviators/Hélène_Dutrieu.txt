In 1911 she regained the Coupe Femina temporarily with a flight of 254&nbsp;km in 2 hours 58 minutes but that years cup was eventually won by Marie Marvingt. In September 1911 Dutrieu travelled to the United States with her Farman III biplane. She competed for the womens altitude record and the Rodman-Wanamaker trophy, subsequently won by Matilde E. Moisant Matilde Moisant, at the Nassau Boulevard airfield meeting in Garden City, New York. In the same year Dutrieu beat 14 male pilots to win the Coppa del Re (Kings Cup) in Florence, Italy. In 1912 she reputedly became the first woman to pilot a seaplane. Later the same year she won a prize in competition against four other seaplane pilots, including Caudron Réne Caudron, at Ouchy-Lausanne, Switzerland. In 1913 Dutrieu became the first woman aviator awarded membership of the Légion dhonneur (French Legion of Honour).

===World War I and afterward===

She later became the director of Val-de-Grâce Campagne à Val-de Grâce military hospital.  After the war she became a journalist. In 1922 she married Pierre Mortier and took French nationality. She later became vice president of the women’s section of the Aéro-Club de France (Aero Club of France). In 1953 she was awarded the Médaille de lAéronautique (French Medal for Aeronautics).{{Citation needed date=February 2007}} In 1956 she created the Coupe Hélène Dutrieu-Mortier (Hélène Dutrieu-Mortier Cup) with a prize of 200,000 francs for the French or Belgian woman pilot who made the longest non-stop flight each year.
