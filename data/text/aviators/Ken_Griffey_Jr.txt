Griffey is the son of former MLB player Ken Griffey Sr. and the father of National Football League player Trey Griffey.

==Early life==
Griffey was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, on November 21, 1969. (He shares a birthday with another Donora native and Baseball Hall of Fame Hall-of-Famer, Stan Musial.) His family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where his father, Ken Griffey Sr., played for the Cincinnati Reds, when Ken Jr. was six years old.{{citation needed date=January 2015 reason=Article changed from "six" to "three" by a known Wikipedia vandal at 15:53, September 3, 2014}} Ken Jr. was in the clubhouse during his fathers back-to-back championships in the 1975 World Series 1975 and 1976 World Series.
As a young child, Ken Sr. would instill in his son the pride of a team accomplishment rather than the individual performance. "My dad would have bopped me on the head when I was a kid if I came home bragging about what I did on the field. He only wanted to know what the team did." He attended Moeller High School Archbishop Moeller High School<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/griffke02.shtml  title=Ken Griffey Jr. publisher=BaseballReference.com  accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> in Cincinnati (the same high school as his future teammate Barry Larkin),<ref>{{cite web url=http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player_career.jsp?player_id=115135  title=Ken Griffey Jr.: Biography and Career Highlights, whitesox.com: Players  publisher=Mlb.mlb.com  accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> where he was the U.S high school baseball player of the year in 1987.

==Professional career==

===Minor League Baseball (1987&ndash;1988)===
Griffey was the number one overall selection by the Seattle Mariners during the Major League Baseball Amateur Draft held on June 2, 1987. He received a signing bonus of $16,000 from the Mariners. On June 11, 1987, Griffey joined the Bellingham Mariners of the Northwest League, a Class A Short Season minor league. He made his professional debut on June 16, 1987. During the 54-game season he hit .313. He led the team with 14 home runs, 40 RBI and 13 steals. Baseball America magazine named him the leagues number one major league prospect.<ref>{{cite web url=http://sports.jrank.org/pages/1809/Griffey-Ken-Jr-Picked-No-1-in-Baseball-Draft.html title=Ken Griffey Jr. - Picked No. 1 In Baseball Draft website=sports.jrank.org}}</ref>

In 1988, Griffey joined the San Bernardino Spirit of the Class A-Advanced California League. During his 58 games with the Spirit, Griffey batted .338, hit 11 home runs, drove in 42 runs, and stole 32 bases.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/former-san-bernardino-player-ken-griffey-jr-hits-600th-career-homer/n-3656601 title=Former San Bernardino Player, Ken Griffey Jr., Hits 600th Career Homer - OurSports Central website=www.oursportscentral.com}}</ref> Late in the season, Griffey was promoted to the Vermont Mariners of the Class AA Eastern League (baseball) Eastern League.

In his eleven seasons with Seattle (1989–1999) Griffey established himself as one of the most prolific and exciting players of the era, racking up 1,752 hits, 398 home runs, 1,152 RBIs, and 167 stolen bases. He led the American League in home runs for four seasons (1994, 1997, 1998, and 1999), was voted the A.L. MVP in 1997, and maintained a .297 career batting average. In his first major league at-bat, he doubled.<ref name="AP-20100603">{{cite news  url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/02/AR2010060204410.html  date=June 3, 2010  title=Ken Griffey Jr. retiring at age 40  agency=Associated Press  first=Tim  last=Booth  work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

His defense in center field was widely considered the standard of elite fielding during the decade, exemplified by his streak of 10 straight Rawlings Gold Glove Award Gold Gloves from 1990–1999. His impressive range allowed frequent spectacular diving plays, and he often dazzled fans with over-the-shoulder basket catches and robbed opposing hitters of home runs by leaping up and pulling them back into the field of play. He was featured on the Wheaties cereal box and had his own signature sneaker line from Nike, Inc..

Griffey was a frequent participant in the Major League Baseball All-Star Game All-Star Game during the 1990s. He led his league multiple times in different hitting categories.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=115135&c_id=mlb#sectionType=career&statType=1&season=2010&gameType=%27R%27  title=Ken Griffey Jr. Stats, Bio, Photos, Highlights  publisher=MLB.com  accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref>

In 1990 and 1991, Griffey and his father became the first son and father to play on the same team at the same time. In his fathers first game as a Mariner, on August 31, 1990, the pair hit back-to-back singles in the first inning and both scored.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SEA/SEA199008310.shtml  title=August 31, 1990 Kansas City Royals at Seattle Mariners Play by Play and Box Score  publisher=Baseball-Reference.com  date=August 31, 1990  accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> On September 14, the pair hit back-to-back home runs in the top of the first off California Angels pitcher Kirk McCaskill, becoming the first father-son duo to hit back-to-back home runs.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CAL/CAL199009140.shtml  title=September 14, 1990 Seattle Mariners at California Angels Play by Play and Box Score  publisher=Baseball-Reference.com  date=September 14, 1990  accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> The duo played a total of 51 games together before Griffey Sr. retired in June 1991.

At the MLB Home Run Derby in 1993, which was held at Oriole Park at Camden Yards Oriole Park in Baltimore, Griffey hit the warehouse beyond the right field wall on the fly and he is still the only player ever to do so. As with every home run that hits Eutaw Street, each feat is honored with a circular plaque, embedded horizontally onto the concourses walkway, in the exact spot where the home run landed.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4DF1130F930A25754C0A965958260 "Now Fielder Is Where He Knows He Belongs", The New York Times] July 13, 1993</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/bal/ballpark/guide.jsp  title=The Official Site of the Baltimore Orioles publisher=MLB.com  accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> In 1994, he led the league in voting for All Star game selection. That season, which ended prematurely on August 12 due to the labor dispute, saw Griffey hit 30 home runs in the Mariners first 65 games. He would go on to have 4 multi-home run games that year. While his pace cooled somewhat in the final eight weeks of the season (he only hit 10 home runs in the Mariners last 47 games), his 40 home runs by August 12 still put him two ahead of Chicagos Frank Thomas (designated hitter) Frank Thomas and four ahead of Clevelands Albert Belle for the AL lead.

One of the most memorable moments of Griffeys career with the Mariners came during the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) against the New York Yankees. After losing the first two games, the Mariners and Griffey were on the verge of elimination, but came back to win the next two games, setting up a decisive fifth game. In the bottom of the 11th inning of Game 5, with Griffey on first base, teammate Edgar Martínez hit a The Double (Seattle Mariners) double. Griffey raced around the bases, slid into home with the winning run, and popped up into the waiting arms of the entire team. The 1995 AL Division Series would kick off a brief rivalry between the Yankees and the Mariners. Griffey may have escalated it by saying that he would never play for the Yankees, because the Yankees allegedly treated his father, Ken Griffey Sr. badly. Also, when Griffey was a kid visiting his dad in the Yankee clubhouse, Yankee manager Billy Martin would, believing that children did not belong in the clubhouse, kick him out of there. Although the Mariners subsequently lost the American League Championship Series ALCS to the Cleveland Indians (managed by later Mariners manager Mike Hargrove), that moment remains one of the most memorable in Mariners history, capping a season that "saved baseball in Seattle",<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1888518&type=story "Martinez is beloved by Seattle fans; what about Hall voters?"

In 1997, Griffey led the Mariners to the AL West crown and captured the American League Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award Most Valuable Player Award, hitting .304, with 56 home runs and 147 run batted in RBIs.  The next season, 1998, was a season which was followed closely by the national media as both Griffey and Mark McGwire entered the summer ahead of the pace of Roger Maris home run record of 61. Despite Griffey falling short, Major League Baseball put forth an effort to draw a new set of young fans and regain those disenchanted by the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike 1994 strike focused on McGwire, Sosa, and Griffeys 1998 home run chase pursuit of Maris record. Griffey, however, fell out of the spotlight due to some nagging injuries and was surpassed by Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa, who finished with 66 home runs, himself falling short of McGwires then record 70. Despite falling out of the record chase, Griffey nearly duplicated his 1997 statistics, finishing with 56 home runs and 146 RBI.

In 1999, he ranked 93rd on Sporting News The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players.<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/lisn100.shtml Baseballs 100 Greatest Players]. Baseball Almanac. Retrieved January 28, 2011.</ref> This list was compiled during the 1998 season, counting only statistics through 1997. At age 29 (going on 30), he was the youngest player on the list. That same year, Griffey was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. However, when TSN updated their list for a new book in 2005, despite having surpassed 400 and 500 home runs, Griffey remained at Number 93.

While playing with Seattle, Griffey was a 10-time American League Gold Glove winner, the 1992 All-Star Game MVP, 1997 AL MVP, 1998 ESPY Awards ESPY co-winner for Male Athlete of the Year, 1999 Players Choice Award#Award for Player of the Decade Players Choice Awards Player of the Decade (by the players), and was named to the All-Century team in 1999.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp The All-Century Team].

====Departure from Seattle (1999–2000)====
Griffey formerly lived in the same neighborhood in Orlando, Florida Orlando as golfer Payne Stewart. After Stewarts 1999 South Dakota Learjet crash death in a plane crash on October 25, 1999, Griffey started expressing a desire to live closer to his relatives in his hometown of Cincinnati. Not only did Griffey want to live closer, but he wanted to be able to raise his kids, Trey and Taryn (Tevin was not born at the time). On February 10, 2000, Griffey was traded to the Reds for pitcher Brett Tomko, outfielder Mike Cameron, and minor leaguers Antonio Perez and Jake Meyer. Griffey signed a nine-year, $112.5M contract with the Reds after the trade was completed, with a club option for a tenth.<ref>{{cite news title=Griffey Dealt to Reds in Five Player Deal url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/2000/02/10/griffey_trade_ap/ work=Sports Illustrated accessdate=March 18, 2011 date=February 12, 2000}}</ref>

The 2000 season began what has generally been seen by the media as a decline in Griffeys superstar status. Although his statistics during this season were respectable, they were far below his previous level of play: in 145 games, Griffey hit .271 with 40 home runs, but his .943 on-base plus slugging was his lowest mark in five years. In 2000, Griffey also changed his number from 24 to 30, the number his father wore while playing in both Cincinnati and Seattle. The number 24 was already retired in honor of Tony Pérez. Additionally, from 2001 through 2004, Griffey was plagued by a string of injuries, including season-ending injuries in 2002, 2003, and 2004.<ref name="blogging-baseball.com">{{cite web url=http://www.blogging-baseball.com/2006/12/24/griffey-jrs-broken-hand-adds-to-list-of-injuries-over-last-6-years/  title=Griffey Jr.s Broken Hand Adds to List of Injuries Over Last 6 years  accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> Worse yet for Griffey, the cumulative effects of the injuries lowered his bat speed,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.faqs.org/sports-science/A-Ba-and-timeline/Baseball-Bat-Speed.html  title=Baseball Bat Speed  accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> resulting in less power and fewer home runs (he Slugging percentage slugged only .426 before succumbing to injury in 2002, his lowest output in seven years). Injuries forced Griffey to miss 260 out of 486 games from 2002 through 2004, diminishing both his skills and his star reputation.

In 2004, Griffey avoided major injury during the first half of the season, and on June 20 became the 20th player to hit 500 career home runs. His 500th home run came on Fathers Day in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Memorial Stadium Busch Stadium, with his father in the stands; the homer tied Griffey with his father in career hits with 2,143. However, the injury bug bit again just before the All-Star break; he suffered a partial hamstring tear, knocking him out of the All-Star Game and putting him on the disabled list yet again.

Griffey finished the 2004 season on the disabled list after suffering a rupture of his right hamstring in San Francisco.<ref>Kinney, T.

Griffey was starting in right field for the first time in his 16-year Major League career when he raced toward the gap to try to cut off a ball before it got to the wall. He slid as he got to the ball, but in the process hyper-extended his right leg, tearing the hamstring completely off the bone. He later came out of the game, complaining of "tightness" in the hamstring exacerbated by chilly conditions in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1837903  title=MRI: Griffey has partial hamstring tear publisher=ESPN.com}}</ref> However, there was far more to it than anyone realized at the time.

He ended the season tied with Mickey Mantle, after having passed Jimmie Foxx, Ted Williams, Willie McCovey, Ernie Banks, Eddie Mathews, Mel Ott, and Eddie Murray.

Early in September, he strained a tendon in his left foot (an injury unrelated to his past hamstring and calf problems), and was listed as day-to-day for several weeks.<ref>{{cite web url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2154461   title=Reds not counting out Griffeys return this season}}</ref> On September 22, with the Reds out of playoff contention, the team decided to bench him for the rest of the season so he could immediately have arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and a separate operation to repair scars from his 2004 hamstring operation. Still, his 128 games in 2005 were the most he had played since 2000. Griffeys resurgence was recognized when he was named National League Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award Comeback Player of the Year. He played in the World Baseball Classic for the American team that off-season with his father as a coach. Griffey batted .524, but the USA failed to reach the semifinals.

Before the game, the Mariners honored him with a 15-minute presentation which included a highlight reel of his playing career with the Mariners, a presentation of a "The House that Griffey Built" memorial by Mariners hall-of-famers and former teammates Jay Buhner and Edgar Martínez, and a 4-minute standing ovation from the sold-out crowd.<ref>{{cite web url=http://mlb.mlb.com/sea/ballpark/sea_ballpark_history.jsp  title=Safeco Field History  author=Mariners.com}}</ref> Griffey did not expect such a welcome or a turnout by fans when he came back, and a short but emotional speech was given by Griffey afterwards.<ref name="mlb.mlb.com">{{cite web url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070620&content_id=2038527&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb  title=Seattle icon Griffey to return to Safeco website=Mlb.mlb.bom accessdate=July 24, 2016}}</ref> Many of the fans in attendance made signs professing their gratitude and adoration toward him with quotes such as: "The House that Griffey Built", "Seattle Junior", and "Griffey we miss you."<ref name="mlb.mlb.com"/> Griffey went 1–5 in the game.

Following the Cincinnati Reds versus Seattle Mariners series from June 22–24, 2007, a fan movement emerged petitioning Mariners management to bring Griffey back. Over 1,900 signatures were collected on a fan vid-blog/petition.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://bringgriffeyback.com/  title=城咲仁！  publisher=Bringgriffeyback.com  accessdate=February 16, 2011  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708093953/http://bringgriffeyback.com/  archivedate=July 8, 2011  df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Griffey received the most votes of any player in the National League for the 2007 All-Star balloting and on the July 10 game, he went on to drive in two runs for the National League. On July 16, 2007, Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 587th home run to pass Frank Robinson for 6th place on the all-time home run List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders list. On July 18, 2007, Griffey hit his 2,500th hit, a first-inning single off Atlanta Braves starting pitcher John Smoltz.

On September 19, 2007, in a game against the Chicago Cubs, Griffey fielded a Derrek Lee single in right field, then suddenly went down in pain. The injury, first thought to be a lower abdominal strain, was later revealed to be a season-ending groin strain. This marked one of many seasons in Cincinnati in which Griffey had to end the year on the disabled list. Griffey ended the 2007 season with 593 career home runs.

On August 22, 2007, Griffey was selected as an all-time Rawlings Gold Glove winner, on a list of nine players considered the greatest defensive players in the last fifty years.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.rawlingsgoldglove.com/News/Releases/Aug-22-2007.aspx  title=Rawlings to Present First-Ever Junior Rawlings Gold Glove Award archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829145003/http://www.rawlingsgoldglove.com/News/Releases/Aug-22-2007.aspx archivedate=August 29, 2007}}</ref> He finished the season with 78 runs, 146 hits, 24 doubles, one triple, 30 home runs, 93 RBIs, and a .277 batting average.

====2008====
On April 4, 2008, Ken Griffey Jr. passed Reggie Jackson for 16th on the all-time list after driving in his 1,702nd RBI.<ref>{{cite web url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=280404117  title=ESPN – Phillies vs. Reds – Recap – April&nbsp;4, 2008  publisher=ESPN  date=April 4, 2008  accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> On June 9, Griffey hit his 600th home run on a 3–1 pitch from Mark Hendrickson of the Florida Marlins in the first inning at Land Shark Stadium in Miami.

Despite being ranked second in the National League All-Star voting for outfielders for most of the first half of the season, Griffey finished fourth with 2,907,746 ballots, 87,000 votes behind Kosuke Fukudome. He was not selected to the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game All-Star Game as a reserve. At the All-Star Break, Griffey was batting .239 with 12 home runs and 42 RBIs. "I always have a backup plan...If you cant hit a tough lefty, bunt. If you cant hit a tough righty, bunt. If you cant go to the All-Star Game, go to the Bahamas", Griffey said.<ref>{{cite web author=Mark Sheldon&nbsp;/&nbsp;MLB.com  url=http://cincinnati.reds.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080706&content_id=3076321&vkey=news_cin&fext=.jsp&c_id=cin  title=Volquez named to All-Star staff, reds.com: News  publisher=Cincinnati.reds.mlb.com  date=June 26, 2008  accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref>

Griffey was criticized by some for his effort during his stint with the Reds. Gregg Doyel had this to say of the years Griffey was with the Reds in comparison to the 2010 Reds team. "Its a different Reds team than the older, beer-bellied softball teams of recent years. Those Reds were Ken Griffey and Adam Dunn lounging on the clubhouses leather couches, hitting home runs, misplaying balls in the outfield and thinking they had it all figured out, when all they knew how to do was lose."<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/story/13867227/cincinnati-deserves-this-fun-successful-reds-team  title=Cincinnati deserves this fun, successful Reds team  publisher=Cbssports.com  date=September 2, 2010  accessdate=February 16, 2011  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129155844/http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/story/13867227/cincinnati-deserves-this-fun-successful-reds-team  archivedate=January 29, 2012  df= }}</ref>

===Chicago White Sox (2008)===
On July 31, 2008, at the Trade (sports)#MLB MLB trade deadline, Griffey was traded to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for pitcher Nick Masset and infielder Danny Richar, ending his nine-year tenure in Cincinnati.<ref>{{cite web url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/8398348 work=FOX Sports on MSN author= Rosenthal, Ken title=Griffey accepts trade to White Sox date=July 31, 2008 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819211536/http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/8398348 archivedate=August 19, 2008}}</ref> In his first game with the White Sox, he went 2 for 3 with 2 RBIs, a walk, and a run.<ref>{{cite web author=Mark Sheldon url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080731&content_id=3230331&vkey=trade2008&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb  title=Griffey moves from Reds to White Sox publisher=MLB.com  date=February 10, 2000  accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref>

On August 20, 2008, Griffey hit his first home run as a member of the White Sox, off of the Mariners R.A. Dickey, which moved him into a tie with former outfielder Sammy Sosa for 5th place in career home runs.<ref>{{cite web author=Scott Merkin&nbsp;/&nbsp;MLB.com  url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080820&content_id=3338798&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb  title=Griffey moves into tie for fifth on HR list  publisher=MLB.com  date=August 20, 2008  accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> He surpassed Sosa on September 23, with one off Minnesotas Matt Guerrier.<ref>{{cite web url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3605690  title=Griffey passes Sosa for fifth on all-time home run list publisher=ESPN  date=September 24, 2008  accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref>

Griffeys signature moment with the White Sox came on September 30, the last game of the 2008 season; an extra 163rd game between the White Sox and Minnesota Twins to break the tie atop the AL Central. In the 5th inning of the scoreless game, the Twins threatened with Michael Cuddyer on third and one out. Twins 3B Brendan Harris flied out softly to Griffey in center field, who threw a strike to White Sox catcher A. J. Pierzynski who tagged out Cuddyer at home in a homeplate collision to complete the double play and end the threat. The White Sox went on to beat the Twins, 1-0, to advance to the 2008 American League Division Series, where they fell to the Tampa Bay Rays.

On October 30, 2008, the White Sox declined a $16&nbsp;million option on Griffey, making him a free agent for the first time in his career. Griffey would instead receive a buyout for $4&nbsp;million, split between the Reds and White Sox.<ref name=options/> Griffey hit 18 home runs with the Reds and White Sox in 2008.<ref name=options>{{cite web  author=Scott Merkin  url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081030&content_id=3655185&vkey=news_cws&fext=.jsp&c_id=cws  title=Sox decline options of Griffey, Hall  publisher=MLB.com  accessdate=February 16, 2011  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416181236/http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081030&content_id=3655185&vkey=news_cws&fext=.jsp&c_id=cws  archive-date=April 16, 2014  dead-url=yes  df=mdy-all }}</ref> When the 2008 season ended he said he wouldnt retire, saying "Ive got things to do."<ref>[http://www.fortwayne.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/SE/20081007/SPORTS/810070310 Sox shed no tears, changes coming]{{dead link date=August 2017  bot=Red Director  fix-attempted=yes }} October 7, 2008.

===Return to Mariners (2009–2010)===
File:KenGriffeyJr2009ST.JPG thumb right Griffey, batting against the Cubs after returning to the Seattle Mariners Mariners during Spring training, March 2009.
As a free agent, Griffey was courted by the Mariners and the Atlanta Braves. The national media was dubious about Griffeys declining skills, with The Washington Post noting "...the Mariners are not about to sign Griffey for baseball reasons; theyre bringing him back to Seattle to sell tickets."<ref>{{cite web url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/baseball-insider/2009/02/seattles_5_million_marketing_p.html  title=Seattles $5 Million Marketing Plan: Ken Griffey  last=Smith  first=Cameron  work=The Washington Post  date=February 14, 2009  accessdate=January 26, 2013}}</ref> Griffey ultimately accepted a contract offer from the Mariners on February 18, 2009, after "agonizing" over the decision. Griffey indicated he was motivated by sentimental reasons toward Seattle, where he received an overwhelmingly positive reception when he last played there as a Cincinnati Red in June 2007, but was inclined towards the Braves for its proximity to his home in Orlando, Florida, and his desire to be with his family during the season.<ref>{{cite web url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3917214  title=Ken Griffey chooses to return to Seattle Mariners  publisher=ESPN  date=February 19, 2009  accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> Apparently, Griffey was very close to signing with the Braves; however, a premature report emerged from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that an Atlanta deal was done and a conversation with Willie Mays and his own 13-year-old daughter played a factor in his choice.<ref>{{cite web author=Jim Street&nbsp;/&nbsp;MLB.com  url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090218&content_id=3846072&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb  title=Griffey headed back to Mariners  publisher=MLB.com  date=February 18, 2009  accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> Griffey once again sported #24 with the Mariners; the team had not issued the number to any player or coach in the nine years between his two stints in Seattle.

Griffey went 1–2 with a home run in his regular season debut against the Minnesota Twins. The home run was Griffeys eighth Opening Day home run; as of 2013, he is tied with Frank Robinson and Adam Dunn for first place in this category. On April 15, 2009, Griffey hit his 400th home run as a Mariner (613th of career), off Los Angeles Angels pitcher Jered Weaver, becoming the first MLB player to hit 400 home runs with one club (Mariners) and 200 home runs with another (Reds). AP stated, "Griffey returned to the Mariners in 2009 and almost single-handedly transformed what had been a fractured, bickering clubhouse with his leadership, energy and constant pranks."<ref>{{cite news url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=txmarinersgriffeyretir  title=Ken Griffey Jr. retiring at age 40  last=Booth  first=Tim  agency=Associated Press  date=June 3, 2010  accessdate=January 26, 2013}}</ref>

On June 23, 2009, at Safeco Field, Griffey hit the 5,000th home run in franchise history, off 2009 San Diego Padres season San Diego Padres pitcher Chad Gaudin.<ref>{{cite news url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlesports/archives/172083.asp  work=Seattle PI  title=Griffey adds piece of history: Ms 5,000th home run  first=Greg  last=Johns  date=June 23, 2009}}</ref> This was Griffeys 619th career home run. On September 1, Griffey hit career home run #621 at the new Yankee Stadium, off Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte in the sixth inning. It marked the 44th different ballpark in which he had hit a home run. On August 12, 2009, against his former team, the Chicago White Sox, he hit an RBI single in the bottom of the 14th inning to win the game, 1–0, for the Mariners.

Griffey returned to the Mariners for the 2010 campaign with a similar contract to that of 2009, but struggled offensively over the first two months while posting a .184 batting average.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/griffke02.shtml  title=Ken Griffey Statistics and History  publisher=Baseball-Reference.com  accessdate=May 14, 2012}}</ref> On April 27, Griffey passed Andre Dawson for 45th on the career hit list. On May 20, 2010, in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays, Griffey hit an RBI single off Blue Jays closer Kevin Gregg to win the game, 4–3, for the Mariners. After starting the ninth inning trailing 3–1, the Mariners rallied in the bottom of the ninth to load the bases on two singles and a Base on balls walk, then tied the game via a walk and a sacrifice fly. The walk-off single was the final hit and RBI of Griffeys Major League Baseball career, and moved him past Rafael Palmeiro to 14th on the all-time RBI list.

===Napgate and retirement===
In May 2010, Mariners manager Don Wakamatsu made the decision to significantly limit Griffeys playing due to his ongoing poor performance.<ref name="ESPN">{{cite web url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5249125  title=Wakamatsu benched Griffey last month  publisher=ESPN.com  date=June 4, 2010  accessdate=January 21, 2013}}</ref><ref name="stark">{{cite web url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&page=rumblings100513  title=Scripting Griffeys final chapter  last=Stark  first=Jayson  publisher=ESPN.com  date=May 13, 2010  accessdate=January 21, 2013}}</ref> On May 10, 2010, beat writer Larry Larue reported that Wakamatsu had not used Griffey in a pinch hitting situation the prior week, with two players stating that Griffey had been asleep.<ref name="Larue1">{{cite web  url=http://blog.thenewstribune.com/mariners/2010/05/10/for-griffey-the-mariners-the-end-is-near/  title=For Griffey & the Mariners, the end is near  last=Larue  first=Larry  publisher=The News Tribune  date=May 10, 2010  accessdate=January 21, 2013  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125062655/http://blog.thenewstribune.com/mariners/2010/05/10/for-griffey-the-mariners-the-end-is-near/  archive-date=November 25, 2015  dead-url=yes  df=mdy-all }}</ref> National media quickly covered the incident, dubbed "Napgate."<ref name="stark"/><ref name="stark" /><ref name="USAToday">{{cite web url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/dailypitch/post/2010/05/can-seattle-mariners-turn-ken-griffeys-nap-controversy-into-a-wakeup-call/1  title=Can Seattle Mariners turn Ken Griffeys nap controversy into a wakeup call?

==Post-playing career==
On February 17, 2011, Griffey was hired by the Mariners as a special consultant. He is involved with the Mariners at spring training and the regular season, along with visiting most of the Mariners minor-league affiliates.<ref>{{cite news url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/baseball/2011/02/15/griffey-returns-to-mariners-as-special-consultant/  title=Griffey returns to Mariners as special consultant  work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer  date=February 11, 2011  accessdate=February 16, 2011  first=Gerry  last=Spratt}}</ref>

On January 22, 2013, the Mariners announced Griffey would be the seventh person inducted into the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame.<ref name="MarinersHOF" /> Griffey joined Alvin Davis (1997), Dave Niehaus (2000), Jay Buhner (2004), Edgar Martínez (2007), Randy Johnson (2012) and Dan Wilson (baseball) Dan Wilson (2012). He was formally inducted on August 10, 2013. Jamie Moyer was selected in 2015.

A campaign had been formed to rename a section of First Avenue South, which runs adjacent to Safeco Field, to Ken Griffey Jr. Drive just after his announcement to retire from baseball. Later, the campaign changed direction after the death of Mariners announcer Dave Niehaus in November 2010 to Dave Niehaus Way South.<ref>{{cite web url=http://mynorthwest.com/646/448285/Honorary-street-for-Dave-Niehaus title=Honorary street for Dave Niehaus}}</ref>

Writer Bill Simmons pointed out the prevalent belief that Griffey was the best home run hitter of the 1990s who everyone was convinced never used PEDs. Therefore, Simmons stated Griffey was the one player who would be the most devastating to "an entire generation of American men" should he ever be linked to steroids.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9137895/the-sweet-scent-spring-mailbag/ title=The Sweet Scent of Spring Mailbag accessdate=May 17, 2013}}</ref>
