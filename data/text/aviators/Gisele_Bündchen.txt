{{quote Capricho, a glossy teen magazine, recently asked 1,100 Brazilian teenagers if they wanted to become fashion models. Eighty-six percent said yes. The reason for this craze stands 1.77 meters tall and has smoldering blue eyes. Her name is Gisele Bundchen—known to all as Gisele—and she is the most celebrated Brazilian since Pele. First introduced by designer Alexander McQueen two years ago, Gisele, now 20, is the worlds top cover girl, taking to more than 1,600 catwalks and earning a reported $7,000 an hour. When she struts her trademark runway walk—sassy and high-stepping, like a filly in tall grass—hearts beat faster from Milan to Manhattan. She has become an international icon: Vogue put the Brazilian bombshell on its cover three times last year and in December crowned her "Model of the Year."<ref>{{cite web title=This Years Model url=http://www.newsweek.com/years-model-159397 website=Newsweek.com accessdate=1 November 2014 date=25 September 2000}}</ref>}}

==Criticism==
In November 2002, Bündchen was paid a reported £320,000 and given two black mink coats by American fur company Blackglama to head its new advertising campaign. Activists from PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), invaded the runway during the Victorias Secret show in New York and brandished placards saying "Gisele: fur scum". The Brazilian was one of the most prominent models to wear fur since it began to come back into acceptability in fashion circles. A PETA spokesperson said: "By getting into bed with the fur-pushers, Gisele has become PETA enemy number one. Every time that Gisele or anyone else wears furs they are sentencing countless animals to a violent and cruel death."<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1413381/Gisele-left-exposed-on-catwalk-by-fur-protest.html title=Gisele left exposed on catwalk by fur protest publisher=The Sunday Telegraph date=16 November 2002 accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref>

In August 2010, she was criticized after saying that breastfeeding should be law. She told Harpers Bazaar Harpers Bazaar UK, "Some people here [in the U.S.] think they dont have to breastfeed, and I think Are you going to give chemical food to your child when they are so little?...I think there should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies for six months."<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/7927001/Gisele-Bundchen-forced-to-apologise-over-breastfeeding-comments.html title=Gisele Bundchen forced to apologise over breastfeeding comments publisher=The Sunday Telegraph date=4 August 2010 accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref> Bündchen later posted a statement on her blog saying, "My intention in making a comment about the importance of breastfeeding has nothing to do with the law. It comes from my passionate beliefs about children. Being a new mom has brought a lot of questions. I feel like I am in a constant search for answers on what might be the best for my child. Its unfortunate that in an interview sometimes things can seem so black and white."<ref>{{cite web title=If Only All Moms Could Breastfeed Like Gisele url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/10/gisele-breastfeeding-instagram_n_4421101.html}}</ref>

"Gisele would never say not to use sunscreen because she has had family members who have had skin cancer.

In September 2011, a lingerie TV ad starring Bündchen in Brazil, was deemed "offensive and sexist" by the Brazilian government department for policies for women, which called for the ad to be banned, saying in a statement that the campaign "reinforce the wrong stereotypes of the woman as a husbands mere sex object and ignore the great advances weve achieved in deconstructing sexist thoughts and practices." The secretariat petitioned the National Council for Advertising Self-Regulation (known by its Portuguese acronym CONAR), to open an investigation into whether the campaign was sexist, and CONAR accepted the request.<ref>{{cite web url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2096771,00.html title=Giseles Sexist TV Ad?

In 2010, she retained the top spot as Forbess highest-earning model.<ref name="vogue.com"/> In May 2011, Forbes ranked her as the worlds top-earning model for the fifth consecutive time.

Bündchen, however, disputes the number, telling WSJ. magazine in November 2013, "Who are they speaking to when they come up with these numbers? Not my accountant, thats for sure."<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303376904579135712399293816  title=Gisele Bündchens Model Life   work=The Wall Street Journal   first=Derek  last=Blasberg  date=7 November 2013}}</ref>
