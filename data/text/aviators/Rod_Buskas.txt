==Early life==
Buskas was born on January 7, 1961, in Wetaskiwin, Alberta, and was raised in Medicine Hat, Alberta.

==Playing career==
Buskas was selected in the 6th round (112th overall) of the 1981 NHL Entry Draft by the Penguins after a solid junior career with the Medicine Hat Tigers. After some seasoning in the minors, he made his NHL debut near the start of the 1982–83 NHL season 1982–83 season, and finished the year with 4 points and 102 penalty minutes in 41 games.

After another season split between Pittsburgh and the minors, Buskas established himself as a regular for the Penguins in 1984–85 NHL season 1984–85, and was a fixture on the clubs blueline for the next five seasons. In 1986–87 NHL season 1986–87, he had his best offensive season, finishing the year with 3 goals and 15 assists for 18 points. In 1987–88 NHL season 1987–88, he led the Penguins with a career-high 206 penalty minutes, and midway through the 1988–89 NHL season 1988–89 season he broke Bryan Watson (ice hockey) Bryan Watsons club record of 872 penalty minutes. While the Penguins finished consistently near the bottom of the league for most of the 1980s, the maturing of superstar Mario Lemieux finally saw the team reach the playoffs in 1989, and Buskas appeared in the first 10 NHL playoff games of his career.

At the start of the 1989–90 NHL season 1989–90 campaign, Buskas was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks for a draft pick. However, he appeared in only 17 games for the Canucks before breaking his ankle, requiring surgery. While recovering, he was traded back to Pittsburgh, and he appeared in 6 more games for the Penguins late in the season. He would leave Pittsburgh for good at the start of the 1990–91 NHL season 1990–91 season, when he was selected by the Los Angeles Kings in the NHL Waiver Draft. At the time, he was Pittsburghs all-time leader in penalty minutes with 959, although that record would later be broken by Troy Loney and is now held by Kevin Stevens.

Buskas spent a year in Los Angeles, recording 3 goals and 11 points along with 182 penalty minutes in 57 games, before being dealt to the Chicago Blackhawks early in the 1991–92 NHL season 1991–92 season. Now a sparingly-used depth defender, he finished the year with 4 assists in 47 games between Los Angeles and Chicago. That seasons playoffs would prove to be one of the highlights of his career, as Chicago reached the Stanley Cup finals before losing to his former team, the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Buskas saw his NHL career come to a close in 1992–93 NHL season 1992–93, as he was assigned to the minors for the first time since 1984 and appeared in only 4 games for the Blackhawks. Released at the end of the season, he spent two more seasons in the IHL (1945-01) IHL with the Las Vegas Thunder before retiring in 1995. Buskas finished his career with totals of 19 goals and 63 assists for 82 points in 556 career NHL games, along with 1294 penalty minutes.

Following his retirement Buskas, who has obtained a pilots license during his playing career, remained in the Las Vegas area and ran a flight school in Henderson, Nevada Henderson, Nevada. He would also later serve for a time as an assistant coach with the Las Vegas Thunder.

Buskas is currently a captain with Hawaiian Airlines.<ref>{{cite web last1=Malinowski first1=Mark title=Getting To Know: Rod Buskas url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/news/article/getting-to-know-rod-buskas  website = The Hockey News accessdate=April 12, 2017 date=July 12, 2015}}</ref>
