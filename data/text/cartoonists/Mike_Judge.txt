is an American actor, animator, writer, producer, director and musician.

He also wrote and directed the films Beavis and Butt-Head Do America (1996), Office Space (1999), Idiocracy (2006) and Extract (film) Extract (2009).

Raised in New Mexico, Judge graduated from University of California, San Diego,
where he studied physics.
After becoming uninterested in his career in science, Judge began to focus on animation and creating short films, one of which was developed into the successful MTV series Beavis and Butt-Head, which eventually spawned a 1996 feature film as well as the spin-off series Daria (in which Judge had no involvement).

In 1995, Judge and former The Simpsons Simpsons writer Greg Daniels developed King of the Hill, which quickly became a hit with both critics and audiences. During the run of the show, Judge took some time off to write and direct Office Space, Idiocracy, and Extract.

As King of the Hill was coming to an end, Judge created his third show titled The Goode Family, which received mixed reviews and was cancelled after 13 episodes. After a four-year hiatus, he created his fourth show Silicon Valley, which has received critical acclaim since its premiere.{{citation needed date=September 2017}}
