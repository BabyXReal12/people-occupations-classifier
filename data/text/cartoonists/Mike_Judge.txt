Raised in New Mexico, Judge graduated from University of California, San Diego,<ref name="ucsdnews">{{cite web last1=Patringenaru first1=Ioana title=From Physics Degree to Hollywood Success url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/thisweek/2009/06/15_gradjudge.asp website=This Week @ UCSD publisher=UCSD University Communications accessdate=August 16, 2017 ref=ucsdnews}}</ref> where he studied physics.<ref name="ucsdnews"/> After becoming uninterested in his career in science, Judge began to focus on animation and creating short films, one of which was developed into the successful MTV series Beavis and Butt-Head, which eventually spawned a 1996 feature film as well as the spin-off series Daria (in which Judge had no involvement).

In 1995, Judge and former The Simpsons Simpsons writer Greg Daniels developed King of the Hill, which quickly became a hit with both critics and audiences. During the run of the show, Judge took some time off to write and direct Office Space, Idiocracy, and Extract.

As King of the Hill was coming to an end, Judge created his third show titled The Goode Family, which received mixed reviews and was cancelled after 13 episodes. After a four-year hiatus, he created his fourth show Silicon Valley, which has received critical acclaim since its premiere.{{citation needed date=September 2017}}

Judges fourth directorial effort was 2009s Extract (film) Extract. Shortly after completing Office Space, Judge was already about 40 pages into his follow-up script, set in the world of an extract factory, when he was convinced by his representative team that he needed to shelve that and concentrate on something more commercial. "The only idea that I had that anyone was interested in was what eventually became Idiocracy," says Judge. Over the next several years he focused his energy on developing Idiocracy. But years later, by the time of the films release, audiences had decided that Office Space had struck a chord, so they were ready to see Judge return to on-the-job humor, and thus the Extract script was given new life.<ref name="Nasson, Tim">{{cite web url=http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/behind_the_scenes/Extract-BEHINDTHESCENES.php title=Extract-Behind the Scenes work=wildaboutmovies.com author=Nasson, Tim date=August 13, 2009 accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>

Seeking to keep Extract below the radar of the studio system, Judge and his producers set up a production company, Ternion Productions, and arranged private financing—while partnering with Miramax for domestic distribution of the film. Judge relied heavily on his own personal knowledge of the industrial world to bring the story to life. "I actually worked in a factory a little bit myself ...

==Political views==
Despite his King of the Hill protagonist Hank Hill being identifiable as a Conservatism in the United States conservative<ref name=hank>{{cite web url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/707/707158p4.html title=Interview: Mike Judge Reaches the Top of the Hill author=Eric Goldman}}</ref> and his The Goode Family being essentially a satire of many Modern liberalism in the United States liberal viewpoints, Judge avoids discussing his political leanings. The Goode Family has been described as a Media bias in the United States#Conservative bias conservative show.<ref>{{cite web url=http://exurbanleague.com/Home/tabid/40/EntryId/347/The-Top-25-Conservative-TV-Shows-of-the-last-25-Years.aspx title=The Top 25 Conservative TV Shows of the last 25 Years deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605031541/http://exurbanleague.com/Home/tabid/40/EntryId/347/The-Top-25-Conservative-TV-Shows-of-the-last-25-Years.aspx archivedate=June 5, 2010 df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In reviewing Idiocracy, Salon.com Salon stated, "Judges gimlet eye is so ruthless that at times his politics seem to border on South Park Republican South Park libertarianism."<ref>{{cite web last=Stevens  first=Dana  url=http://www.slate.com/id/2157486  title=Mike Judges Idiocracy reviewed. – By Dana Stevens – Slate Magazine  publisher=Slate.com  date=January 12, 2007  accessdate=March 28, 2011}}</ref> A writer for the Libertarian Party (United States) libertarian magazine Reason (magazine) Reason seems to agree, comparing King of the Hill to the anti-authoritarian point of view of South Park and The Simpsons, though he calls the show more Populism populist, noting the disdain King of the Hill seems to have for bureaucrats, professionals, and Big-box store big-box chains.<ref>{{cite web author=Jesse Walker  url=http://reason.com/archives/2003/12/14/animated-discourse  title=Animated Discourse publisher=Reason.com  date=December 14, 2003  accessdate=March 28, 2011}}</ref>

Still, Judge denies having political messages in his shows, saying in an IGN interview about King of the Hill:<ref name=hank/>

{{quote I try to not let the show get too political. To me, its more social than political I guess youd say, because thats funnier. I dont really like political reference humor that much. Although I liked the episode "Hanks Bully" where Hanks talking to the mailman and he says, Why would anyone want to lick a stamp that has Bill Clinton on it? To me thats just like more of a character thing about Hank than it is a political joke or anything. I dont want to do a bunch of stuff about the Iraq War war, particularly.}}

In June 2016, before the United States presidential election, 2016 presidential election in November, Rolling Stone published an article stating that Judge would produce Idiocracy-themed Campaign advertising campaign advertisements opposing Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016 Donald Trumps presidential campaign if given permission from Fox Broadcasting Company Fox to do so.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/idiocracy-team-ready-anti-donald-trump-campaign-ads-20160603 title=Idiocracy Team Ready Anti-Donald Trump Campaign Ads work=rollingstone.com accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref> It was later reported by Business Insider that the ads would not go forward.<ref>{{citeweb url=http://www.businessinsider.com/terry-crews-says-no-idiocracy-anti-donald-trump-ads-2016-7 title=Terry Crews says there wont be any Idiocracy-themed ads attacking Donald Trump after all work=businessinsider.com accessdate=January 15, 2018}}</ref>
