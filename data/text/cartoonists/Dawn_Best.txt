Dawn Marie Best-Eshleman (born October 12, 1981{{Citation needed date=January 2010}}) is an United States American artist and author known for her work in the Archie Comics version of Sonic the Hedgehog (comic series) Sonic the Hedgehog. She is currently Founder and President of Gloryhound Network, an online resource of publications and tutorials for aspiring artists and writers.

==Comic work==
Best was employed at 19 and became one of Archies youngest creators.<ref>[http://www.sonicstadium.org/articles/39/ Interview: Dawn Best] courtesy [http://www.sonicstadium.org Sonic Stadium]</ref> Her premiere issue of Sonic was issue #101 (2001 in comics 2001), and she has remained active at Archie since. She has since appeared as both guest and attendee of conventions and holding annual charity auctions of original artwork. She has been credited with contributing to several other graphic novels as both artist and writer, including original web serials Sylvanna and Hei√üdampfreaktor. In 2010, she began production on her independently published graphic novel series, VARULV, which became the premier comic book released by her own Gloryhound Network in February 2011. In 2012 she created a limited print-edition of her serial Daemonology under the Glodyhound name. In 2013 Sylvanna was also added to the roster as a joint-effort between her and Sonic writer, Ian Flynn after it successfully was funded via Kickstarter in one night, and went on to double its original funding goal.

Best cites Patrick Spaziante, one of her peers while working for Archie Comics, as one of her main influences in the art of cartooning and pencilling. Others include Joe Madureira, J. Scott Campbell, and Mike Deodato.

==Activism==
Her father, brother, grandparents and uncle all served in various branches of the United States military, and in 2002, Best held her first auction of original art in support of the Fisher House Foundation Fisher House, to which she still contributes, today. In recent years, she has been outspoken about the high cost of a college education versus its necessity for young artists, and has marketed the Gloryhound brand around this mantra.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U70YKmv6AxQ Career Zoo Interview: Dawn Best] courtesy [http://www.thecareerzoo.com The Career Zoo]</ref>  An ordained minister, Bests personal causes often revolve around supporting LGBT marriage equality and suicide prevention, especially among LGBT youth. Many of her original art auctions also support these efforts.

Best resides in rural Pennsylvania and is married to musician Matthew Eshleman.
