==Background==
Pastis was raised in San Marino, California.<ref name="Chron">{{cite news  last=Hartlaub  first=Peter  title=Cartoonist Stephan Pastis cast aside his career in law to put Pearls on the comics page  work=San Francisco Chronicle  url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-09-16/entertainment/17389937_1_stephan-pastis-charles-schulz-comic-strip-artists  date=September 16, 2005  accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref> He started cartooning as a child; his mother brought him pens and paper to amuse him when he was "sick a lot" and had to stay in bed. He attended the University of California, Berkeley University of California at Berkeley, earning a Bachelor of Arts B.A. in Political Science in 1989. The following year Pastis attended law school at UCLA School of Law UCLA, where he received his Juris Doctor J.D.<ref>{{cite web  publisher=The State Bar of California  title=Stephan Thomas Pastis - #168717  work=Attorney Search  url=http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/168717  accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  first=Stephan  last=Pastis  work=Pearls Before Swine  title=Comic for March 18, 2011  url=http://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2011/03/18  date=March 18, 2011  accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref> He kept drawing all during this time, coming up with the first Pearls Before Swine (comics) Pearls Before Swine character, Rat, during what he said was a boring class in law school.<ref name="jd">{{cite web  publisher=JDBliss  title=Interview: Stephan Pastis: Attorney Turned Cartoonist  url=http://www.jdblissblog.com/2006/11/stephan_pastis_.html  date=November 2006  accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref> <blockquote>When I wrote for him [Rat] it seemed pretty honest.

From 1993 to 2002, Pastis was an insurance defense litigation attorney in the San Francisco Bay area, but quickly became disenchanted with the legal profession. He did not like its adversarial nature, nor "the anxiety and tension it produced,"<ref name="jd" /> so in the mid-1990s he revisited his earlier ambition of becoming a Print syndication syndicated cartoonist by submitting various concepts to syndication agencies.

==Pearls Before Swine==
{{main Pearls Before Swine (comic strip)}}
The character of Rat (Pearls Before Swine) Rat came from Pastiss earlier strip, Rat. The character of Pig (Pearls Before Swine) Pig, who is Rats opposite, had been featured in The Infirm, which was about an attorney who numbered an evil pig farmer among his clients. Although Pastis had developed the characters, they were still just stick figures with jokes. One day in 1996, Pastis drove to an ice rink in Santa Rosa where Charles Schulz, the creator of Peanuts (comic strip) Peanuts, had his coffee every day. The meeting did not begin auspiciously, since Pastis blurted out: "Hi, Sparky [Schulzs nickname], my name is Stephan Pastis and Im a lawyer."  Schulz turned pale; he thought Pastis was there to serve him with a subpoena. However, he recovered, and Pastis remembers Schulzs graciousness: <blockquote>I was a total stranger to him, and he let me sit down at his table and we talked for an hour.  I took a picture with him. He looked at some of the strips that I had been doing and gave me some tips. Man, I was on cloud nine.<ref name="Chron" /></blockquote>

In addition to Peanuts, Pastis drew inspiration from Dilbert. <blockquote>What worked for me personally was to study the writing of Dilbert. I just bought a bunch of Dilbert books and studied how to write a 3-panel strip.  Then I showed them to a group of people who were acquaintances (but not quite friends) in order to get their honest assessment of which ones were funny and which ones werent. As to the ins and outs of getting syndicated, I bought a book called "Your Career in the Comics" by Lee Nordling.<ref name="blog">{{cite web  first=Stephan  last=Pastis  work=The Official Pearls Before Swine Blog  title=About  url=http://stephanpastis.wordpress.com/about/  accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref></blockquote> 

Pastis drew about 200 strips for the new comic and selected 40 of the best, but fearing more rejection, let them sit on the counter in his basement for the next two years. It was not until 1999, when he visited the grave of a college friend who had been a free spirit and had encouraged him to be the same, that he overcame his fear and submitted them to three different syndicates, including United Media United Features. United took the unprecedented step of first running the strips on its comics.com Internet site to gauge reader response. When Scott Adams, Dilberts creator, whom Pastis had never met, endorsed the strip the response "went through the roof".<ref name="rsmith91"/>

Pastis also credits Get Fuzzy cartoonist Darby Conley with contributing to the development of the strip.  They met through their syndication attorney, and Conley taught him how to color the Sunday strips and add gray tones to the dailies.<ref name="rsmith91"/>

Eight months afterwards, Pastis gleefully quit his law practice.<ref name="jd" /> Pastis attributes his dissatisfaction with the law in being helpful insofar that "humor is a reaction to and defense against unhappiness",<ref name="jd" /> and that wanting to get out of his job provided him with the impetus to create better comic strips so that he could get selected for syndication.<ref name="rsmith91"/>

Fifteen years later, Pearls was still one of the fastest-growing comic strips, appearing in more than 650 newspapers worldwide.<ref name="blog" />  Pastis generally works five to nine months ahead of deadline, a rarity in the world of newspaper comics.<ref>{{cite web  first=Stephan  last=Pastis  work=The Official Pearls Before Swine Blog  title=About  url=http://stephanpastis.wordpress.com/about/  date=April 27, 2009  accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref>

Pastis lives in Santa Rosa, California Santa Rosa, California with his wife and two children, where he is on the board of the Charles Schulz Museum, helping with merchandising rights issues and answering questions about Peanuts. 
<blockquote>Schulz is to comic strips what Marlon Brando was to acting.  It was so revolutionary. Before ‘Peanuts,’ the writing was physical, over the top, but Sparky goes inside the soul.  His influence on me is enormous. I’ve taken his backgrounds, the front porch, the beach and the TV beanbag. Rat is Lucy, Goat is Linus and Pig is Charlie Brown. Sparky is a template, whether or not you know it, he’s the template.<ref>{{cite news  last=Dreesen  first=Kathleen  title=A pig, a rat and a goat  work=Napa Valley Register  url=http://napavalleyregister.com/news/local/a-pig-a-rat-and-a-goat/article_e9f30798-0162-500b-bcb4-d4b2479d6d56.html  date=September 2, 2006  accessdate=August 29, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

In June 2014, Pastis collaborated with Bill Watterson, the creator of Calvin and Hobbes, to do a week-long story line in which a second-grade girl named "Libby" wrote a few of Pastiss cartoon frames for him. After the strips were published, Pastis revealed that the artwork for three of the strips<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2014/06/04  title=Pearls Before Swine  date=4 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2014/06/05  title=Pearls Before Swine  date=5 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine/2014/06/06  title=Pearls Before Swine  date=6 June 2014}}</ref> was in fact drawn by Watterson.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://stephanpastis.wordpress.com/2014/06/07/ever-wished-that-calvin-and-hobbes-creator-bill-watterson-would-return-to-the-comics-page-well-he-just-did  author=Stephan Pastis  date=7 June 2014  title=Ever Wished That Calvin and Hobbes Creator Bill Watterson Would Return to the Comics Page? Well, He Just Did.}}</ref> In the last cartoon of the sequence, Libby explains to Pastis that she would not continue drawing comic strips, saying that "Theres a magical world out there," a reference to the words spoken by Calvin in the final strip of Calvin and Hobbes.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.dailydot.com/lol/bill-watterson-pearls-before-swine  title=Calvin and Hobbes creator Bill Wattersons secret return to comics  publisher=The Daily Dot  author=Cooper Fleishman  date=7 June 2014}}</ref>

==Treasuries==
Pastiss first treasury, Sgt. Piggys Lonely Hearts Club Comic, was published in 2004. In addition to the content of the previous books, BLTs Taste So Darn Good and This Little Piggy Stayed Home, and Sunday strips in full color, Pastis included responses from readers and a section in which he explained why certain strips were not successful, and how he would have corrected the content. He continues to release the treasuries at the rate of about one every two years, with his ninth one, Pearls Hogs the Road, released in 2017. Each book in the series is subtitled "A Pearls Before Swine Treasury".
