William Boyd "Bill" Watterson II (born July 5, 1958) is a former American cartoonist and the author of the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, which was Print syndication syndicated from 1985 to 1995. Watterson stopped drawing Calvin and Hobbes at the end of 1995 with a short statement to newspaper editors and his readers that he felt he had achieved all he could in the medium. Watterson is known for his negative views on licensing and comic syndication, his efforts to expand and elevate the newspaper comic as an art-form, and his move back into Private sphere private life after he stopped drawing Calvin and Hobbes. Watterson was born in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, whose suburban Midwestern United States setting was part of the inspiration for Calvin and Hobbes.

==Early life==
Bill Watterson was born in Washington, D.C., the United States, where his father James G. Watterson (1932–2016) worked as a patent attorney. The family relocated to Chagrin Falls, Ohio in 1965 when Watterson was six because his mother Kathryn wanted to be closer to her family and felt that the small town was a good place to raise children.

Watterson drew his first cartoon at age eight, and spent much time in childhood social isolation alone, drawing and cartooning. This continued through his school years,<ref name="short biography">{{cite web   url= http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cbillbio.html   title= A Short Biography of Bill Watterson   year= 2002   accessdate= September 1, 2009   first= Tim   last= Hulsizer   deadurl= yes   archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090416091717/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cbillbio.html   archivedate= April 16, 2009   df= mdy-all }}</ref> during which time he discovered comic strips such as Pogo (comics) Pogo, Krazy Kat, and Charles M. Schulz Charles Schulz Peanuts which subsequently inspired and influenced his desire to become a professional cartoonist.<ref>Watterson, Bill (1995). The Calvin & Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book, p. 17.

His parents encouraged him in his artistic pursuits. Later, they recalled him as a "conservative child" — imaginative, but "not in a fantasy way", and certainly nothing like the character of Calvin that he later created.<ref>Gene Williams (August 30, 1987), [http://ignatz.brinkster.net/calterego.html "Calvins Other Alter Ego"] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522191711/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/calterego.html  date=May 22, 2013 }}, Cleveland Plain Dealer.</ref> Watterson found avenues for his cartooning talents throughout primary and secondary school, creating high school-themed super hero comics with his friends and contributing cartoons and art to the school newspaper and yearbook.<ref name=martell>{{Cite book  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6wHaqIDzDEC  title=Looking for Calvin and Hobbes: The Unconventional Story of Bill Watterson and His Revolutionary Comic Strip  last=Martell  first=Nevin  date=2009-10-05  publisher=A&C Black  isbn=9780826429841  language=en}}</ref>{{rp 20–3}}

From 1976 to 1980, Watterson attended Kenyon College and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. He had already decided upon a career in cartooning, but he felt that his studies would help him move into editorial cartooning. While at college, he continued to develop his art skills; during his sophomore year, he painted Michelangelos Creation of Adam on the ceiling of his dorm room.<ref>Bill Watterson (May 20, 1990), [http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cglimpsed.html "Some Thoughts on the Real World by One Who Glimpsed It and Fled"] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708132258/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cglimpsed.html  date=July 8, 2013 }}, Kenyon College Commencement Speech</ref> He also contributed cartoons to the college newspaper, some of which included the original "Spaceman Spiff" cartoons.{{efn Many of these early cartoons are archived online.<ref>{{cite web   title =Rare Bill Watterson Art url= http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cbillart.html   publisher = Ignatz  accessdate= June 12, 2014}}</ref>}}

Later, when Watterson was creating names for the characters in his comic strip, he decided upon Calvin (after the Protestant reformer John Calvin) and Hobbes (after the social philosopher Thomas Hobbes), allegedly as a "tip of the hat" to the political science department at Kenyon. In The Complete Calvin and Hobbes, Watterson stated that Calvin is named for "a 16th-century theologian who believed in predestination," and Hobbes for "a 17th-century philosopher with a dim view of human nature."

Watterson wrote a brief, tongue-in-cheek autobiography in the late 1980s.<ref name="bio">{{cite web  url=http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cautobio.html  title=The Brief Tongue-in-Cheek Autobiography of Bill Watterson  author=Bill Watterson  accessdate=May 18, 2008  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705120756/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cautobio.html  archivedate=July 5, 2008  df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early work===
Watterson was inspired by the work of Cincinnati Enquirer political cartoonist Jim Borgman, a 1976 graduate of Kenyon College, who currently draws Zits (comic strip) Zits, and decided to try to follow the same career path as Borgman, who in turn offered support and encouragement to the aspiring artist. Watterson graduated in 1980 and was hired on a trial basis at the Cincinnati Post, a competing paper of the Enquirer. Watterson quickly discovered that the job was full of unexpected challenges which prevented him from performing his duties to the standards set for him.  Not the least of these challenges was his unfamiliarity with the Cincinnati political scene, as he had never resided in or near the city, having grown up in the Cleveland, Ohio Cleveland area and attending college in central Ohio. The Post abruptly fired Watterson before his contract was up.<ref name = "honk">{{Citation   url = http://home3.inet.tele.dk/stadil/interw.htm   publisher = Tele   archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060218193101/http://home3.inet.tele.dk/stadil/interw.htm   archivedate =February 18, 2006   title= Bill Watterson, the creator of Calvin and Hobbes on cartooning, syndicates, Garfield, Charles Schulz, and editors   newspaper = Honk Magazine   issue = 2   year = 1987   accessdate = March 17, 2006   first = Andrew   last = Christie}}</ref>

He then joined a small advertising agency and worked there for four years as a designer, creating grocery advertisements while also working on his own projects, including development of his own cartoon strip and contributions to Target: The Political Cartoon Quarterly.<ref name= "groc">{{Cite book   title = The Complete Calvin and Hobbes   chapter = Introduction  page = 491   volume = 1   publisher=Andrew McMeel   author-link = Bill Watterson   isbn = 0-7407-4847-5   year = 2005   first =Bill   last = Watterson}}</ref>

As a freelance artist, Watterson has drawn other works for various merchandise, including album art for his brothers band, calendars, clothing graphics, educational books, magazine covers, posters, and post cards.<ref>{{cite web title=The various other works drawn by Watterson. url=http://www.platypuscomix.net/otherpeople/watterson.html}}</ref>

===Calvin and Hobbes and rise to success===
Watterson has said that he works for personal fulfillment. As he told the graduating class of 1990 at Kenyon College, "Its surprising how hard well work when the work is done just for ourselves." Calvin and Hobbes was first published on November 18, 1985. In Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book, he wrote<ref>{{Cite book  last = Watterson  first = Bill title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book  publisher = Andrews and McMeel  year = 1995 page = 21  isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}</ref> that his influences included Charles M. Schulz Charles Schulzs Peanuts, Walt Kellys Pogo (comics) Pogo, and George Herrimans Krazy Kat. Watterson wrote the introduction to the first volume of The Komplete Kolor Krazy Kat. Wattersons style also reflects the influence of Winsor McCays Little Nemo Little Nemo in Slumberland.<ref name="bob">{{cite web url=http://www.zompist.com/bob8.html

Like many artists, Watterson incorporated elements of his life, interests, beliefs, and values into his work—for example, his hobby as a cyclist,<ref>{{Cite book last = Watterson  first = Bill title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book  publisher = Andrews and McMeel  year = 1995 page = 173 isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}</ref> memories of his own fathers speeches about "building character", and his views on merchandising and corporations. Wattersons cat Sprite very much inspired the personality and physical features of Hobbes (Calvin and Hobbes) Hobbes.<ref>{{Cite book  last = Watterson  first = Bill title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book  publisher = Andrews and McMeel
 year = 1995 page = 22 isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}</ref>

Watterson spent much of his career trying to change the climate of newspaper comics. He believed that the artistic value of comics was being undermined, and that the space which they occupied in newspapers continually decreased, subject to arbitrary whims of shortsighted publishers. Furthermore, he opined that art should not be judged by the medium for which it is created (i.e., there is no High culture "high" art or Low culture "low" art—just art).<ref name="tenthanniversary">{{Cite book  title=The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book  author=Bill Watterson
  year=1995  page=208  publisher=Andrews McMeel  isbn=0-8362-0438-7}}</ref>

===Fight against merchandising his characters===
For years, Watterson battled against pressure from publishers to merchandise his work, something that he felt would cheapen his comic.<ref name="cheapcomic">{{cite web  url=http://hobbes.ncsa.uiuc.edu/comics.html   archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210115506/http://hobbes.ncsa.uiuc.edu/comics.html   archivedate=February 10, 2006  title=The Cheapening of the Comics  author=Bill Watterson  work=Festival of Cartoon Art, Ohio State University  date=October 27, 1989  accessdate=March 17, 2006}}</ref> He refused to merchandise his creations on the grounds that displaying Calvin and Hobbes images on commercially sold mugs, stickers, and T-shirts would devalue the characters and their personalities. Watterson said that Universal kept putting pressure on him and said that he had signed his contract without fully perusing it because, as a new artist, he was happy to find a syndicate willing to give him a chance (two syndicates had denied Watterson). He added that the contract was so one-sided that, if Universal really wanted to, they could license his characters against his will, and could even fire him but continue Calvin and Hobbes with a new artist. Wattersons position eventually won out and he was able to renegotiate his contract so that he would receive all rights to his work, but later added that the licensing fight exhausted him and contributed to the need for a nine-month sabbatical in 1991.<ref>{{Cite book  last = Watterson  first = Bill title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book  publisher = Andrews and McMeel  year = 1995 page = 10 isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}</ref>

Despite Wattersons efforts, many unofficial knockoffs have been found, including items that depict Calvin and Hobbes consuming alcohol or Calvin urinating on a logo. Watterson has said, "Only thieves and vandals have made money on Calvin and Hobbes merchandise."<ref>{{Cite book  last = Watterson  first = Bill title = Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book  publisher = Andrews and McMeel  year = 1995 page = 12 isbn = 0-8362-0438-7}}</ref> There are some very rare official T-shirts, posters and a teaching dictionary that exist and are authorized.

===Changing the format of the Sunday strip===
Watterson was critical of the prevailing format for the Sunday strip Sunday comic strip that was in place when he began drawing (and still is, to varying degrees). The typical layout consists of three rows with eight total squares, which take up half a page if published with its normal size. Some newspapers are restricted with space for their Sunday features and reduce the size of the strip. One of the more common ways is to cut out the top two panels, which Watterson believed forced him to waste the space on throwaway jokes that did not always fit the strip. While he was set to return from his first sabbatical, Watterson discussed with his syndicate a new format for Calvin and Hobbes that would enable him to use his space more efficiently and would almost require the papers to publish it as a half-page. Universal agreed that they would sell the strip as the half-page and nothing else, which garnered anger from papers and criticism for Watterson from both editors and some of his fellow cartoonists (whom he described as "unnecessarily hot tempered"). Eventually, Universal compromised and agreed to offer papers a choice between the full half-page or a reduced-sized version to alleviate concerns about the size issue. Watterson conceded that this caused him to lose space in many papers, but he said that, in the end, it was a benefit because he felt that he was giving the papers readers a better strip for their money and editors were free not to run Calvin and Hobbes at their own risk. He added that he was not going to apologize for drawing a popular feature.<ref>{{Cite book

===End of Calvin and Hobbes===
Watterson announced the end of Calvin and Hobbes on November 9, 1995, with the following letter to newspaper editors:

{{bquote 
Dear Reader:<br/>
<br/>
I will be stopping Calvin and Hobbes at the end of the year. This was not a recent or an easy decision, and I leave with some sadness. My interests have shifted, however, and I believe Ive done what I can do within the constraints of daily deadlines and small panels. I am eager to work at a more thoughtful pace, with fewer artistic compromises. I have not yet decided on future projects, but my relationship with Universal Press Syndicate will continue.<br/>
<br/>
That so many newspapers would carry Calvin and Hobbes is an honor Ill long be proud of, and Ive greatly appreciated your support and indulgence over the last decade. Drawing this comic strip has been a privilege and a pleasure, and I thank you for giving me the opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Bill Watterson}}

The last strip of Calvin and Hobbes was published on December 31, 1995.

==After Calvin and Hobbes==
Since the conclusion of Calvin and Hobbes, Watterson has taken up painting, at one point drawing landscapes of the woods with his father. He has kept away from the public eye and has given no indication of resuming the strip, creating new works based on the strips characters, or embarking on new commercial projects, though he has published several Calvin and Hobbes anthologies. He does not sign autographs or license his characters, staying true to his stated principles. In previous years, Watterson was known to sneak autographed copies of his books onto the shelves of the Fireside Bookshop, a family-owned bookstore in his hometown of Chagrin Falls, Ohio. He ended this practice after discovering that some of the autographed books were being sold online for high prices.<ref name="2005 AP story">{{cite web   url = http://www.projo.com/yourlife/content/projo_20051024_calhobbes.885b8c7.html   title = Calvin and Hobbes creator stays out of view, even at debut of collected strips   date=October 24, 2005}}</ref>

Watterson rarely gives interviews or makes public appearances. His lengthiest interviews include the cover story in The Comics Journal No. 127 in February 1989,<ref name="The Comics Journal No. 127, February 1989">{{cite web   url = http://www.tcj.com/the-comics-journal-no-127-february-1989/   title = The Comics Journal No. 127, February 1989: Featuring an interview with Bill Watterson; an essay by Ralph Steadman; the Brad Holland sketchbook publisher=Tcj.com   date=November 4, 2013}}</ref> an interview that appeared in a 1987 issue of Honk (magazine) Honk Magazine,<ref name="honk"/> and one in a 2015 Watterson exhibition catalogue.<ref name="wp111">{{cite news url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/03/10/read-heres-an-excerpt-from-bill-wattersons-rare-new-calvin-and-hobbes-interview/ title=Read: Here’s an excerpt from Bill Watterson’s rare new ‘Calvin and Hobbes’ interview last=Cavna first=Michael date=March 10, 2015 work=Washington Post accessdate=October 27, 2016}}</ref>

On December 21, 1999, a short piece was published in the Los Angeles Times, written by Watterson to mark the forthcoming retirement of iconic Peanuts creator Charles Schulz.<ref>{{cite news url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/21/news/cl-45937 title=Drawn Into a Dark but Gentle World last=Watterson first=Bill newspaper=Los Angeles Times date=December 21, 1999 accessdate=December 4, 2016}}</ref>

In the years that followed the end of Calvin and Hobbes, many attempts were made to locate Watterson in his hometown of Chagrin Falls. Both The Plain Dealer and the Cleveland Scene sent reporters in 1998 and 2003, respectively, but were unable to locate him.

In 2004, Watterson and his wife Melissa bought a home in the Cleveland suburb of Cleveland Heights, Ohio. In 2005, they completed the move from their home in Chagrin Falls to their new residence.<ref>{{citation   url = http://ignatz.brinkster.net/ctigerstrikes.html   first = Neely   last = Tucker   contribution = The Tiger Strikes Again   title = The Washington Post   date = October 4, 2005   deadurl = yes   archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070814014701/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/ctigerstrikes.html   archivedate = August 14, 2007   df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{citation   url = http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cprivacy.html   first = Joe   last = Milicia   title = Calvin and Hobbes Creator Keeps Privacy   publisher = Associated Press   date = October 22, 2005   deadurl = yes   archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110607004646/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cprivacy.html   archivedate = June 7, 2011   df = mdy-all }}</ref>

In or around 2003, Gene Weingarten of The Washington Post sent Watterson the first edition of the Barnaby (comic strip) Barnaby book as an incentive, hoping to land an interview. Weingarten passed the book to Wattersons parents, along with a message, and declared that he would wait in his hotel for as long as it took Watterson to contact him. Wattersons editor Lee Salem called the next day to tell Weingarten that the cartoonist would not be coming.<ref name=martell/>{{rp 6}}

In early 2010, Watterson was interviewed by The Plain Dealer on the 15th anniversary of the end of Calvin and Hobbes. Explaining his decision to discontinue the strip, he said,

{{bquote 
This isnt as hard to understand as people try to make it. By the end of ten years, Id said pretty much everything I had come there to say. Its always better to leave the party early. If I had rolled along with the strips popularity and repeated myself for another five, ten, or twenty years, the people now "grieving" for Calvin and Hobbes would be wishing me dead and cursing newspapers for running tedious, ancient strips like mine instead of acquiring fresher, livelier talent. And Id be agreeing with them. I think some of the reason Calvin and Hobbes still finds an audience today is because I chose not to run the wheels off it. Ive never regretted stopping when I did.<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.cleveland.com/living/index.ssf/2010/02/bill_watterson_creator_of_belo.html title=Bill Watterson, creator of beloved Calvin and Hobbes comic strip looks back with no regrets author=John Campanelli newspaper=The Plain Dealer date=February 1, 2010 accessdate=February 1, 2010}}</ref>}}

In 2008, he provided a foreword for the first book collection of Richard Thompson (cartoonist) Richard Thompsons Cul de Sac (comic strip) Cul de Sac comic strip. In April 2011, a representative for Andrews McMeel received a package from a "William Watterson in Cleveland Heights, Ohio" which contained a 6″ × 8″ oil-on-board painting of Cul de Sac (comic strip) Cul de Sac character Petey Otterloop, done by Watterson for the Team Cul de Sac fundraising project for Parkinsons disease in honor of Richard Thompson who was diagnosed in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://richardspooralmanac.blogspot.com/2009/07/some-news.html title=Cul de Sac: Some News last=Thompson first=Richard date=July 16, 2009 website=Cul de Sac publisher= access-date=2016-07-27}}</ref> Wattersons syndicate has since become Universal Uclick, and they said that the painting was the first new artwork of his that the syndicate has seen since Calvin and Hobbes ended in 1995.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/this-just-in-first-new-art-from-calvin-and-hobbes-creator-in-16-years-syndicate-says/2011/04/22/AF7l7NQE_blog.html title=THIS JUST IN: First new art from ‘Calvin and Hobbes’ creator in 16 years, syndicate says first=Michael last=Cavna date=April 22, 2011 work=Washington Post}}</ref>

In October 2013, the magazine Mental Floss published an interview with Watterson, only the second since the strip ended. Watterson again confirmed that he would not be revisiting Calvin and Hobbes, and that he was satisfied with his decision. He also gave his opinion on the changes in the comic book industry and where it would be headed in the future:

{{bquote 
Personally, I like paper and ink better than glowing pixels, but to each his own. Obviously the role of comics is changing very fast. On the one hand, I dont think comics have ever been more widely accepted or taken as seriously as they are now. On the other hand, the mass media is disintegrating, and audiences are atomizing. I suspect comics will have less widespread cultural impact and make a lot less money. Im old enough to find all this unsettling, but the world moves on. All the new media will inevitably change the look, function, and maybe even the purpose of comics, but comics are vibrant and versatile, so I think theyll continue to find relevance one way or another. But they definitely wont be the same as what I grew up with.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/53216/mental-floss-exclusive-our-interview-bill-watterson  title=Mental Floss Exclusive: Our Interview with Bill Watterson!  date=October 17, 2013 publisher=Mental Floss}}</ref>}}

On April 1, 2016 for April Fools Day, Berkeley Breathed posted on Facebook that Watterson had signed "the franchise over to my administration". He then posted a comic with Calvin, Hobbes, and Opus all featured. The comic is signed by Watterson, though it remains to be seen how involved he actually was.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.facebook.com/berkeleybreathed/photos/a.114529165244512.10815.108793262484769/1169777789719639/?type=3&theater title=Calvin and Hobbes signed over to Berkeley Breathed=20 Minutes date=April 1, 2016 accessdate=April 1, 2016}}</ref> Breathed posted another "Calvin County" strip featuring Calvin and Hobbes, also "signed" by Watterson on April 1, 2017, along with a fake The New York Times story ostensibly detailing the "merger" of the two strips.<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.berkeleybreathed.com/calvin-county-watterson-breathed-mashup-the-time-warneraol-merger-of-the-comic-world title=Calvin County: Watterson - Breathed Mash-up: The Time Warner/AOL Merger of the Comic World last=Derkins first=Susie date=April 1, 2017 publisher=BERKELEY BREATHED accessdate=April 1, 2017 archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404050114/http://www.berkeleybreathed.com/calvin-county-watterson-breathed-mashup-the-time-warneraol-merger-of-the-comic-world archive-date=April 4, 2017 dead-url=yes df=mdy-all}}</ref>
Berkeley Breathed included Hobbes in a November 27, 2017 strip as a stand in for the character Steve Dallas.

===Exhibitions===
In 2001, Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum at Ohio State University mounted an exhibition of Wattersons Sunday strips. He chose thirty-six of his favorites, displaying them with both the original drawing and the colored finished product, with most pieces featuring personal annotations. Watterson also wrote an accompanying essay that served as the foreword for the exhibit, called "Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday Pages 1985–1995". which opened on September 10, 2001. It was taken down in January 2002.  The accompanying published catalog had the same title.<ref name="Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday Pages">{{cite web url=http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/books/detail?sku=9780740721359 title=Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday pages 1985-1995 publisher=Andrew Mcmeel access-date=October 3, 2017 archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606055203/http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/books/detail?sku=9780740721359 archive-date=June 6, 2017 dead-url=yes df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Awards and honors==
Watterson was awarded the National Cartoonists Societys Reuben Award in both 1986 and 1988.<ref name="reub">{{cite web   url = http://www.reuben.org/reuben.html   title = Reuben Award Winners 1946–Present   publisher = National Cartoonist Society   accessdate = October 31, 2010   deadurl = yes   archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120420080045/http://www.reuben.org/reuben.html   archivedate = April 20, 2012   df = mdy-all }}</ref>  Wattersons second Reuben win made him the youngest cartoonist to be so honored, and only the sixth person to win twice, following Milton Caniff, Charles Schulz, Dik Browne, Chester Gould, and Jeff MacNelly.  (Gary Larson is the only cartoonist to win a second Reuben since Watterson.)  In 2014, Watterson was awarded the Grand Prix at the Angoulême International Comics Festival for his body of work, becoming just the fourth non-European cartoonist to be so honored in the first 41 years of the event.
