Seth is the pen name of Gregory Gallant (born September 16, 1962), a Canadian cartoonist best known for his series Palookaville (comics) Palookaville and his mock-Autobiographical comics autobiographical graphic novel Its a Good Life, If You Dont Weaken (1996).

Seth draws in a style influenced by the classic cartoonists of The New Yorker.  His work is highly nostalgic, especially for the early-to-mid-20th Century period, and of Southern Ontario.  His work also shows a great depth and breadth of knowledge of the history of comics and cartooning.

==Personal life==

Seth was born Gregory Gallant in Clinton, Ontario Clinton, Ontario, Canada.
He attended the Ontario College of Art in Toronto.{{sfn Thalheimer 2010 p=560}}  As of 2004, he lives in Guelph, Ontario, with his wife Tania.
==Career==

Seth, then living in Toronto, first drew attention to his work in 1985 when he took over art duties from the Hernandez brothers for Mister X (Vortex) Mister X from Toronto publisher Vortex Comics.  In April 1991 he launched his own comic book, Palookaville (comics) Palookaville, with Montreal publisher Drawn and Quarterly.  By this time, Seths artwork had evolved to a style inspired by The New Yorker cartoons of the 1930s and 1940s.{{sfn Bongco 2000 p=199}}
<!-- Seths first published comics work was providing the artwork to the Vortex Comics series Mister X (Vortex) Mister X, shortly after Los Bros Hernandez left.  He left after issue #13, and went into illustration for a few years.  In 1990, he began his own series, Palookaville (comics) Palooka-ville, which was one of the first series to be published by Montréal, Canada-based Drawn and Quarterly.  It became part of a miniature boom in non-genre alternative comics from Canada in the 1990s. Seth, Chester Brown, and Joe Matt not only also began their own semi-autobiographical comics autobiographical series at the same time, but were friends and sometimes depicted each other in their stories. Palooka-Ville began as a low-key chronicle of the artists daily life but moved on to longer and more ambitious stories, including what was later collected as the graphic novel Its a Good Life, If You Dont Weaken. -->
He is also a magazine illustrator and book designer, perhaps best known for his work designing the The Complete Peanuts complete collection of Charles M. Schulzs classic comic strip Peanuts. The books, released by Fantagraphics Books in 25 separate volumes (so far) combine Seths signature aesthetic with Schulzs minimalistic comic creation. Similarly, he is designing the Collected Doug Wright (cartoonist) Doug Wright, and the John Stanley (comics) John Stanley Library.

Seths illustration work includes :File:Aimee Mann - Lost in Space.jpg the cover artwork for Aimee Manns album Lost in Space (album) Lost in Space (2001) and the jacket and French flaps for the Penguin Classics Portable Dorothy Parker (2006).{{sfn Thalheimer 2010 p=561}}

Clyde Fans, the story of two brothers whose trade in electric fan (mechanical) fans suffers and eventually goes out of business from the failure to adapt to the rise of air conditioning, was serialized in Palooka-ville. Seths short graphic novel Wimbledon Green, about an eccentric comic-book collector, was published in November 2005.

==Graphic novels==
From September 2006 to March 25, 2007, Seth serialized a graphic novel titled George Sprott (1894–1975), for New York Times Magazine#The Funny Pages the Funny Pages section of The New York Times Magazine.
Selections from George Sprott were featured in Best American Comics 2009. In the liner notes of that publication, Seth announced he was expanding Sprott into a book, filling in gaps that were cut to meet the restraints given by NYTM.  The book was published by Drawn &amp; Quarterly in May 2009.
Seths affection for early- and mid-20th century popular culture and his relative disdain for pop culture since then is a recurrent theme in his work, both in terms of the characters (who are often nostalgic for the period) and his artistic style.
Although, as a teenager, he was a vocal fan of mainstream superhero comics; he even had a couple of Comic book letter column fan letters published.{{citation needed date=April 2014}}

Seths artwork has landed on the cover of The New Yorker three times, which he said was a professional milestone he was happy to achieve.
Seth will be collaborated with childrens novelist Lemony Snicket in his ongoing series All the Wrong Questions, starting with Book One: Who Could That Be at This Hour? released October 23, 2012.
==Model buildings==

In a collaboration between the Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery, Seth, and RENDER, one of the buildings from Seths Dominion City project has been re-built as a walk-in theatre in KW AGs Eastman Gallery
