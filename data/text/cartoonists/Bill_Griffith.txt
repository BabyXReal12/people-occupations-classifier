===Zippy===
<!-- Deleted image removed: File:Billgriffith122806.gif right thumb 560px Bill Griffiths Zippy the Pinhead Zippy (December 28, 2006). Griffith often draws himself into his strip. -->
The first Zippy strip appeared in the underground Real Pulp #1 (Print Mint) in 1971. The strip went weekly in 1976, first in the Berkeley Barb and then syndicated nationally through Rip Off Press.<ref name= lambiek /> The one-row format Zippy strip debuted in the Berkeley Barb in 1976 and continues in weekly newspapers.

In 1979, he added his alter ego character, Griffy,<ref name= heller /> to the strip. He describes Griffy as "neurotic, self-righteous and opinionated, someone with whom Zippy would certainly contrast. I brought the two characters together around 1979, perhaps symbolically bringing together the two halves of my personality. It worked. Their relationship seemed to make Zippys random nuttiness more directed and Griffys cranky, critical persona had his foil, someone to bounce happily off of his constant analysis of everything and everyone around him."<ref>{{cite book  url=https://books.google.com/?id=KECrByuSZF8C&pg=PA43&dq=zippy+%22bill+griffith%22#v=onepage&q=zippy%20%22bill%20griffith%22&f=false  last1= Dooley  first1= Michael Patrick  first2= Stephen  last2= Heller title=The Education of a Comics Artist publisher=Allworth Press year=2005 page=43  isbn= 9781581154085}}</ref>

In 1982, the "Zippy Theme Song" was composed and performed, with lyrics by The B-52s Fred Schneider and vocals by The Manhattan Transfer Manhattan Transfers Janis Siegel (singer) Janis Siegel.<ref>{{cite web  url= http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/themsong.htm  title= Zippy Theme Song  website= zippythepinhead.com  date=   publisher=   access-date= }}</ref> Also on the cut are singers Phoebe Snow and Jon Hendricks.

The daily Zippy strip (syndicated by King Features Syndicate King Features to over 200<ref name= lambiek /> newspapers worldwide) started in 1986. Griffith compares the creation of the strip to jazz: "When Im doing a Zippy strip, Im aware that Im weaving elements together, almost improvising, as if I were all the instruments in a little jazz combo, then stepping back constantly to edit and fine-tune. Playing with language is what delights Zippy the most."<ref name=is>{{cite web  url= http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aaishehavingfunyet.html  title= Is he having fun yet?  website= zippythepinhead.com  date=   publisher=   access-date= }}</ref>

Years ago, as continuity strips gave way to humor strips, typeset episode subtitles vanished from strips. In a nod toward the classic daily strips of yesteryear, Griffith keeps the tradition alive by always centering a hand-lettered subtitle above each Zippy strip.

In 2007, Griffith began to focus his daily strip on Zippys "birthplace", Dingburg.<ref name= heller /> Griffith said, "Over the years, I began to expand Zippys circle of friends beyond my usual cast of characters to a  wider world of people like Zippy&mdash;other pinheads. I kept this up for a few months, happily adding more and more muu-muu-clad men and women until one day the whole thing just reached critical mass. The thought then occurred, Where do all these friends of Zippy live? Do they live in the real world which Zippy has been seen escaping for years&mdash;or do they live apart, in a pinhead world of their own? Thus Dingburg, The City Inhabited Entirely by Pinheads was born. It even had a motto: Going too far is half the pleasure of not getting anywhere. The logical next step was to imagine Dingburg streets and neighborhoods&mdash;to create a place where Zippys wacky rules would be the norm and everyone would play 24-hour Skeeball and worship at the feet of the giant Muffler Man. Zippy had, at last, found his home town."

In 2008, Griffith presented a talk on Zippy at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. In it, he laid out his [https://web.archive.org/web/20100421201121/http://twitpic.com/1fusqz/full "Top 40 List on Comics and their Creation"], which since then has been reposted on numerous comics websites.

===Other works===
For a short period, Griffith joined the team of artists, including Kim Deitch, Drew Friedman (cartoonist) Drew Friedman, Jay Lynch, Norman Saunders, Art Spiegelman, Bhob Stewart and Tom Sutton, who designed Wacky Packages trading cards for the Topps Company. Griffith recently drew Wacky Packages Old School Sketch Cards for Topps.

In 2015 Fantagraphics published Griffiths memoir Invisible Ink: My Mother’s Secret Love Affair With a Famous Cartoonist.

==Personal life==
For over a decade, starting in 1957, Griffiths mother Barbara had an affair with cartoonist Lawrence Lariar; this formed the basis of Bill Griffiths 2015 graphic novel Invisible Ink: My Mother’s Secret Love Affair With a Famous Cartoonist.<ref name=TCJ>[http://www.tcj.com/i-had-moments-where-i-just-broke-down-crying-an-interview-with-bill-griffith/ “I Had Moments Where I Just Broke Down Crying”: An Interview with Bill Griffith], by Chris Mauther, in The Comics Journal; published November 23, 2015; retrieved December 16, 2015</ref>

Invisible Ink depicts various other details and incidents involving Griffiths family, including the fact that Griffith himself is the great-grandson of the photographer and artist William Henry Jackson, and was named for him. 

Griffiths first wife, Nancy, was also involved in the underground comix community.<ref>{{cite web  last= Fox  first= M. Steven  url= http://comixjoint.com/fits2.html  title= Fits #2  website= ComixJoint.com  access-date= December 8, 2016}}</ref>
