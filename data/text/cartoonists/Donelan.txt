Donelan was born in Boston, but grew up in Plymouth, Massachusetts, the son of advertising artist Paul Donelan. He studied art at Southeastern Massachusetts Technological Institute but did not finish a degree, and went to work in retail.

In 1977, disappointed that Joe Johnson (cartoonist) Joe Johnsons pioneering gay comic strips Miss Thing and Big Dick had ended their run in The Advocate, Donelan submitted a cartoon to the publication, which turned into a long-running series of his own. "Its a Gay Life" gently lampooned the gay "clone" culture of the time, focusing primarily on young and middle-aged gay men in their everyday lives.<ref>{{Cite web url=http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/2011/11/gay-ghetto-comics-1-constructing-a-dominant-gay-habitus/ title=Gay Ghetto Comics 1: Constructing a Dominant Gay Habitus Â« The Hooded Utilitarian website=www.hoodedutilitarian.com language=en-US access-date=2017-01-22}}</ref> He continued to work in retail while producing the series, which also yielded two paperback reprints: Drawing on the Gay Experience (1987) and Donelans Back (1988).<ref name="drawing" />
