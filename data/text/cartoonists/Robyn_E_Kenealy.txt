Her later work Roddys Film Companion (a biography of the film actor Roddy McDowall) marks a distinct shift from this style. Although Roddys Film Companion is biographical, it is also fictional and frequently acknowledges the limitations of truth and fact in historical research. These themes are continued in Steve Rogers American Captain, an autobiographical comic told from the perspective of Captain America Captain Americas alter-ego.<ref name=SRACabout>{{cite web last=Kenealy  first=Robyn  title=Steve Rogers American Captain  url=http://americancaptaincomic.tumblr.com/about  work=Steve Rogers American Captain  accessdate=2 November 2016  deadurl=bot: unknown  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413053025/http://americancaptaincomic.tumblr.com/about  archivedate=13 April 2016  df=dmy }}</ref>

==Roddys Film Companion==
From 2005 to 2011 Kenealy produced Roddys Film Companion, a semi-fictional/biographical comic about the life of the actor Roddy McDowall, whose most well-known role was playing List of Planet of the Apes characters#Cornelius Cornelius in Planet of the Apes (1968 film) Planet of the Apes. Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Joseph Mankiewicz and Darryl Zanuck also feature in the comics. However, Roddys Film Companion is not so much concerned with presenting an accurate portrait of Roddy McDowalls life, but rather with interrogating the limits of truth and reality in biographies through fictionalisation. As Kenealy writes on her website, "Roddys Film Companion is a one half fiction semi-fictional biography comic of child actor child star cum character actor Roddy McDowall (whom you might remember from such films as How Green Was My Valley (film) How Green Was My Valley and Planet of the Apes) and one half a musing on the phenomenon of celebrity itself, as applied to both author and subject."<ref name="Roddys Film Companion">{{Cite web url=http://www.wayfarergallery.net/roddysfilmcompanion/ title=Roddys Film Companion accessdate=2009-02-18 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514094817/http://www.wayfarergallery.net/roddysfilmcompanion/ archivedate=14 May 2009 df=dmy-all}}</ref> The first issue, released in 2006, is set while Roddy was filming the Darryl Zanuck production of Cleopatra (1963 film) Cleopatra. In late 2008 she started uploading Roddys Film Companion to the internet.
