Searle was born in Cambridge, England, where his father was a Post Office worker who repaired telephone lines.<ref name=telegraph/> He started drawing at the age of five and left school (Central School – now Parkside Community College Parkside School) at the age of 15. He trained at Cambridge College of Arts and Technology (now Anglia Ruskin University) for two years.

In April 1939, realizing that war was inevitable, he abandoned his art studies to enlist in the Royal Engineers. In January 1942, he was stationed in Singapore. After a month of fighting in Malaya, he was taken prisoner along with his cousin Tom Fordham Searle, when Singapore Battle of Singapore fell to the Japanese. He spent the rest of the war a prisoner, first in Changi Prison and then in the Kwai jungle, working on the Siam-Burma Death Railway.  Searle contracted both beri-beri and malaria during his incarceration, which included numerous beatings, and his weight dropped to less than 40 kilograms. He was liberated in late 1945 with the final defeat of the Japanese.  After the war, he served as a courtroom artist at the Nuremberg trials.

He married the journalist Kaye Webb in 1947; they had twins, Kate and Johnny. In 1961, he moved to Paris, leaving his family; they were divorced in 1967.<ref>{{cite news  last=Eccleshare  first=Julia  date=17 January 1996  title=OBITUARY: Kaye Webb  url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-kaye-webb-1324557.html   newspaper= The Independent  access-date=29 January 2017    quote=married ... thirdly 1946 Ronald Searle (one son, one daughter; marriage dissolved 1967)}}</ref> Later he married Monica Koenig, a painter, theatre and jewellery designer.<ref>[http://www.artslant.com/ny/events/show/12859-monica-searle-the-art-of-the-necklace Monica Searle: The Art of the Necklace]  Artslant – New York – Retrieved 5 January 2012</ref> After 1975, Searle and his wife lived and worked in the mountains of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence Haute Provence.

His wife Monica died in July 2011 and Searle died on 30 December 2011, aged 91.

==Early work as war artist==
Although Searle published the first St Trinians School St Trinians cartoon in the magazine Lilliput (magazine) Lilliput in 1941, his professional career really begins with his documentation of the brutal camp conditions of his period as a prisoner-of-war of the Japanese in World War II in a series of drawings that he hid under the mattresses of prisoners dying of cholera.  Searle recalled, "I desperately wanted to put down what was happening, because I thought if by any chance there was a record, even if I died, someone might find it and know what went on."  But Searle survived, along with approximately 300 of his drawings.  Liberated late in 1945, Searle returned to England where he published several of the drawings in fellow prisoner Russell Braddons The Naked Island. Another of Searles fellow prisoners later recounted, "If you can imagine something that weighs six stone or so, is on the point of death and has no qualities of the human condition that arent revolting, calmly lying there with a pencil and a scrap of paper, drawing, you have some idea of the difference of temperament that this man had from the ordinary human being."<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news  url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art-obituaries/8989894/Ronald-Searle.html   location=London   work=The Daily Telegraph   title=Ronald Searle   date=3 January 2012}}</ref>

Most of these drawings appear in his 1986 book, Ronald Searle: To the Kwai and Back, War Drawings 1939–1945.<ref>{{cite web  author =Bill Maudlin  work=The New York Times  date=10 August 1986  title= Sketches From Life and Death – review of To the Kwai – And Back  url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE5D81338F933A2575BC0A960948260 }}</ref> In the book, Searle also wrote of his experiences as a prisoner, including the day he woke up to find a dead friend on either side of him, and a live snake underneath his head:
:"You can’t have that sort of experience without it directing the rest of your life.  I think that’s why I never really left my prison cell, because it gave me my measuring stick for the rest of my life... Basically all the people we loved and knew and grew up with simply became fertiliser for the nearest bamboo."

At least one of his drawings is on display at the Changi Museum and Chapel, Singapore, but the majority of his originals are in the permanent collection of the Imperial War Museum, London, along with the works of other POW artists. The best known of these are John Mennie, Jack Bridger Chalker, Philip Meninsky and Ashley George Old.

In addition to advertisements and posters, Searle drew the title backgrounds of the Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder film The Happiest Days of Your Life.<ref name=telegraph/>

After moving to Paris in 1961, he worked more on reportage for Life and Holiday and less on cartoons.
