Selections from The Feminist Funnies appeared as a calendar, Witches, Pigs and Fairy Godmothers: The 1978 Feminist Funnies Appointment Calendar, and in her 1979 book, Im in Training to Be Tall and Blonde. The books success led Field Newspaper Syndicate to distribute Sylvia to newspapers as a daily comic strip starting in 1981.

==Critical reception==
* "Nicole Hollander has been one of our nations leading satirists. This means she is in the business of telling the truth and making it funny... She is a radical social critic who is certain that nothing works, and so what?" (Jules Feiffer, Introduction to The Sylvia Chronicles)
* "What working commentator can confront Sylvias range of subject matter—from macro-economics to stretch marks, from foreign policy to kitty litter—without gnawing anxiously on his or her writing instrument?... her supernatural insight into matters of public policy, her ability to see, as with x-ray vision, through the stupefying drone of media rhetoric." (Barbara Ehrenreich, Introduction to Tales from the Planet Sylvia)
* "There are precious few women cartoonists, and Nicole is the only one with a daily strip who presents the believable struggles of women in contemporary society." (Sara Paretsky)

* "Shrewd and cynical and drily, wittily, outrageously attitudinous." (Katha Pollitt)
