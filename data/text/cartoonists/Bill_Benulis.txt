Bill Benulis (November 5, 1928 - May 30, 2011) was an People of the United States American comic book artist in the 1950s.  His style is distinctive, and he signed his work, but he drew only a small number of stories, in a variety of genres.  His work appears in war comics, horror comics, and science fiction comics, and was reprinted in the Marvel Comics reprint series, War Is Hell (comics) War Is Hell, as well as in several of the reprints of fifties comic books published under the IW imprint in the sixties.
==Biography==
{{Expand section date=June 2008}}
Benulis was born in 1928 in Brooklyn, New York. He married in 1959, and has three children and two grandchildren.

He decided not to pursue his art further past the early 50s in order to provide for his family by working in the post office.  Despite living with the after-effects of childhood polio, he worked many years on foot as a letter carrier in the post office and retired from it around 1993. Sadly, he never drew any more after his short time in comicsâ€”a time in which he was able to work alongside others he admired like Will Eisner and Stan Lee.  He illustrated a cover for an early science fiction book by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.
