==Biography==

=== Early life===

Clem was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota Minneapolis, on September 15, 1982.  He moved around through various locations in Minnesota, including Coon Rapids, Minnesota Coon Rapids, Brooklyn Park, Minnesota Brooklyn Park, Andover, Minnesota Andover, Melrose, Minnesota Melrose, Duluth, Minnesota Duluth, and St. Cloud, Minnesota St. Cloud.  He says that this is a result of his "rampant inability to sit still for more than six months at a time."<ref name="early">{{cite web  url= http://www.barrettslament.com/about.php  title= About  accessdate=2006-11-30  last= Clem  first= Mitch  authorlink=  author2=Lind, Matt  format=  work= [http://www.barrettslament.com/ Barretts Lament]  publisher=  pages=  language=  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040215035101/http://www.barrettslament.com/about.php archivedate=2004-02-15 dead-url= yes  quote= }}</ref>

Clem became interested in comic strips as a child, reading the newspaper strips.  He cites Calvin and Hobbes and The Far Side as the most influential on him in those days. He also credits Looney Tunes as being a childhood influence on his interest in cartooning.<ref name="early"/><ref name="zine" />

In the later part of elementary school, he began developing an interest in superhero comics Batman and Flash (comics) the Flash. In high school, his interest in comic books grew to include what he calls "really weird indie books," The Tick, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, Sandman (Vertigo) Sandman, Milk & Cheese, and the crime works of Brian Michael Bendis.  He had no interest in superheroes at that time, until he read Watchmen, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, and Daredevil: Guardian Devil.<ref name="early"/></ref> He is now an avid fan of DC Comics characters, which he references frequently in his blog and in his autobiographical comic, My Stupid Life.

===Present===

In the summer of 2005, Clem moved from Minneapolis to San Antonio, where he currently resides with his wife and frequent art collaborator Nation of Amanda. He works full-time as a cartoonist and freelance illustrator.<ref name="zine">{{cite web  url= http://graphicnovelreporter.com/content/corporate-rock-and-comics-are-suckers-interview-mitch-clem-interview  title= Corporate Rock and Comics Are For Suckers  accessdate=2006-11-30  last= Jones  first= William  authorlink=  date= 2009-04-09  format=  work=  publisher=  pages=  language=  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614114019/http://graphicnovelreporter.com/content/corporate-rock-and-comics-are-suckers-interview-mitch-clem-interview archivedate=2009-06-14 dead-url= yes  quote= }}</ref>

==Works==

===Summers Over===
Mitch Clems career as a cartoonist and writer first took published form in the late 1990s with his zine, Summers Over, of which he published ten issues. He put out his last issue in 2001, when he switched his focus from print to webcomics with the launch of Nothing Nice to Say.<ref name="zine"/>

===Nothing Nice to Say===

{{main Nothing Nice to Say}}

On February 25, 2002, Clem first published the strip for which he is best known, Nothing Nice To Say, which follows Minneapolis punks Blake and Fletcher.<ref name="90spunk">{{cite web  url= http://www.mitchclem.com/nothingnice/index.php?pageNum_Recordset2=0  title= Evolution of a 90’s Punk  accessdate=2006-11-30  last= Clem  first= Mitch  authorlink=  date= 2002-02-25  format=  work= Nothing Nice To Say  publisher=  pages=  language=  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502185342/http://www.mitchclem.com/nothingnice/index.php?pageNum_Recordset2=0 archivedate=2006-05-02 dead-url= yes  quote= }}</ref>

The comic has survived many hiatuses (the lengthiest lasting from August 14, 2004, to January 31, 2005)<ref name="hiatus">{{cite web  url= http://www.mitchclem.com/nothingnice/203/  title= The End.  accessdate=2004-08-14  last= Clem  first= Mitch  authorlink=  date= 2004-08-14  format=  work=  publisher=  pages=  language=  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012234310/http://www.mitchclem.com/nothingnice/203/ archivedate=2007-10-12 dead-url= yes  quote= }}</ref> and much artistic evolution (probably the most drastic change being a switch from full-color to black and white comics, a decision Clem credits partially to discovering his being partially colorblind),<ref name="colorblind">{{cite web  url= http://rainofbastards.livejournal.com/172819.html  title= Mitch Clem Versus the Establishment  accessdate=2008-01-17  last= Clem  first= Mitch  authorlink=  date= 2008-01-17  work=  publisher=  pages=  language=  quote= }}</ref> but it remains, to this day, one of the longest lasting comics on the internet. The strip is updated on an arbitrary basis.

Dark Horse Comics published an anthology of his Nothing Nice To Say "Volume 2" comic strip in October, 2008.

===The Coffee Achievers===

While working on Nothing Nice, Clem also teamed up with fellow web comic artist Joe Dunn, of [http://www.digitalpimponline.com/strips.php?title=movie Joe Loves Crappy Movies].  Together they worked on the short series [https://web.archive.org/web/20130113063444/http://www.mitchclem.com/coffeeachievers/ The Coffee Achievers], which totaled nine chapters.  Achievers ran from February 1, 2005 to February 10, 2006.<ref name="coffee">{{cite web  url= http://www.mitchclem.com/coffeeachievers/  title= The Coffee Achievers  accessdate=2006-11-30  last= Clem  first= Mitch  authorlink=  author2=Dunn, Joe  date= 2006-02-10  format=  work=  publisher=  pages=  language=  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113063444/http://www.mitchclem.com/coffeeachievers/ archivedate=2013-01-13 dead-url= yes  quote= }}</ref>

===San Antonio Rock City===

<!-- Deleted image removed: File:San Antonio Rock City.jpg 225px thumb Mitch and Victoria from San Antonio Rock City -->
On January 22, 2006, Clem launched his first autobiographical comic series San Antonio Rock City, which centered on him and his then-girlfriend Victoria after moving to San Antonio, Texas TX from Minnesota. The strip generally followed a four-panel format arranged in a square with using the first for the title panel showing Clem and Victoria, parodying American Gothic. Occasionally, there are a few six-strip comics. San Antonio Rock City was his main focus for a while until he canceled it due to his split with his girlfriend Victoria.<ref name="rockcity">{{cite web  url= http://www.mitchclem.com/rockcity/index.php?comic=1  title= Bartender  accessdate=2006-11-30  last= Clem  first= Mitch  authorlink=  date= 2006-01-22  format=  work= San Antonio Rock City  publisher=  pages=  language=  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105151352/http://www.mitchclem.com/rockcity/index.php?comic=1 archivedate=2006-11-05 dead-url= yes  quote= }}</ref> The entire series will be collected in the upcoming book My Stupid Life, Vol. 1 from New Reliable Press.

===My Stupid Life===

On January 16, 2008 Clem began his newest series, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080119114954/http://mitchclem.com/mystupidlife/ My Stupid Life]. As the name implies, the strip is autobiographical, in a style reminiscent of San Antonio Rock City. The comic also co-stars his fiancée, Amanda ([http://nationofamanda.livejournal.com Nation of Amanda]). Amanda sometimes colors the strips in watercolors.

On April 15, 2009, [http://rainofbastards.livejournal.com/220428.html Clem announced on his blog] that he would be releasing a new book, My Stupid Life: Volume One, through New Reliable Press in the Fall of 2009. The book would collect the current run of My Stupid Life, as well as the complete San Antonio Rock City series, Clems first foray into autobiographical comics

===Turnstile Comix===

December 2010 saw the release of the first issue of Clems first direct-to-print comic series, Turnstile Comix. Each issue in the series would showcase one band, and would pair a comic book of true stories about the band with a 7" featuring previously unreleased songs by them. The first issue starred Minneapolis punk band The Slow Death. The second issue, released in late 2012, featured The World/Inferno Friendship Society. The third issue, released in 2014, featured Lemuria.<ref>https://store.silversprocket.net/products/lemuria-comic</ref><ref>http://www.punknews.org/article/48859/mitch-clem-details-turnstile-comix-2-with-the-worldinferno-friendship-society-exclusive</ref>

===As You Were===

In 2013, Clem created and began curating a "punk comix anthology" zine called As You Were (punk comix anthology) As You Were. Each issue features a centralized theme, based upon which a variety of cartoonists from punk scenes all over the world would create unique comics. It is perhaps Clems most critically acclaimed project to-date, having been praised by the likes of NPR, USA Today, Maximumrockandroll, The A.V. Club, and Razorcake. Three issues have been published as of April, 2014, and have included comics by Mitch Clem, Liz Prince, Ben Snakepit, Ramsey Beyer, Liz Suburbia, Cathy G. Johnson, Will Laren, and others.

Clem regularly makes concert flyers and album covers for punk rock bands. He has also made album covers for the bands The Ergs!, Andrew WK, The Steinways, Shang-A-Lang, Bomb the Music Industry!, Something fierce (band) Something Fierce, and others.
