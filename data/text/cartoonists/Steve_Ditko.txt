June 29, 2018) was an American comics artist and writer best known as the artist and co-creator, with Stan Lee, of the Marvel Comics superheroes Spider-Man and Doctor Strange.

Ditko studied under Batman artist Jerry Robinson at the Cartoonist and Illustrators School in New York City. He began his professional career in 1953, working in the studio of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, beginning as an inker and coming under the influence of artist Mort Meskin. During this time, he then began his long association with Charlton Comics, where he did work in the genres of science fiction, horror, and mystery. He also co-created the superhero Captain Atom in 1960.

During the 1950s, Ditko also drew for Atlas Comics (1950s) Atlas Comics, a forerunner of Marvel Comics. He went on to contribute much significant work to Marvel. In 1966, after being the exclusive artist on The Amazing Spider-Man and the "Doctor Strange" feature in Strange Tales, Ditko left Marvel for reasons he never specified.

Ditko continued to work for Charlton and also DC Comics, including a revamp of the long-running character the Blue Beetle, and creating or co-creating the Question (comics) Question, the Creeper (comics) Creeper, Shade, the Changing Man Shade the Changing Man, and Hawk and Dove. Ditko also began contributing to small independent publishers, where he created Mr. A, a hero reflecting the influence of Ayn Rands philosophy of Objectivism (Ayn Rand) Objectivism. Ditko largely declined to give interviews, saying he preferred to communicate through his work.

Ditko was inducted into the comics industrys Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1990, and into the List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994.

==Early life==

Stephen J. Ditko was born on November 2, 1927 in Johnstown, Pennsylvania,<ref>Comics Buyers Guide #1636 (December 2007) p. 135</ref> the son of first-generation Americans of Slovak<ref name=bbend1>Bell, Strange and Stranger, Endnotes, p.1, citing 1920 and 1930 United States Census data.

The second-eldest child in a working-class family, he was preceded by sister Anna Marie,<ref name=bbend1 /> and followed by sister Elizabeth and brother Patrick.<ref name=bb14 /> Inspired by his fathers love of newspaper comic strips, particularly Hal Fosters Prince Valiant, Ditko found his interest in comics accelerated by the introduction of superhero Batman in 1940, and by Will Eisners Spirit (comics) The Spirit, which appeared in a Tabloid (newspaper format) tabloid-sized comic-book insert in Sunday newspapers.<ref name=bb15>Bell, Strange and Stranger, p. 15</ref>

Ditko in junior high school was part of a group of students who crafted wooden models of German airplanes to aid civilian World War II aircraft-spotters.<ref name=bb15 /> Upon graduating from Johnstown High School in 1945,<ref name=bb15 /> he enlisted in the U.S. Army on October 26, 1945,<ref name=bbend1 /> and did military service in postwar Germany, where he drew comics for an Army newspaper.<ref name=bb15 />

==Career==

Following his discharge, Ditko learned that his idol, Batman artist Jerry Robinson, was teaching at the Cartoonists and Illustrators School (later the School of Visual Arts) in New York City. Moving there in 1950, he enrolled in the art school under the G.I. Bill.<ref name="Bell16">Bell, Strange and Stranger, p. 16</ref> Robinson found the young student "a very hard worker who really focused on his drawing"<ref name="AE39">Jerry Robinson interview, Alter Ego (magazine) Alter Ego #38 (Aug. 2004), p. 9</ref> and someone who "could work well with other writers as well as write his own stories and create his own characters",<ref name="AE39" /> and he helped Ditko acquire a scholarship for the following year.<ref name="Bell19">Bell, Strange and Stranger, p. 19</ref> "He was in my class for two years, four or five days a week, five hours a night.

Ditko began professionally illustrating comic books in early 1953, drawing writer Bruce Hamiltons science-fiction story "Stretching Things" for the Key Publications imprint Stanmor Publications, which sold the story to Ajax/Farrell, where it finally found publication in Fantastic Fears #5 (cover-dated Feb. 1954).<ref name="bb20">Bell, Strange and Stranger, p. 20</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=244841 title= Fantastic Fears #5 publisher= Grand Comics Database}}</ref> Ditkos first published work was his second professional story, the six-page "Paper Romance" in Daring Love #1 (Oct. 1953),<ref name="bb20" /> published by the Key imprint Gillmor Magazines.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/241499/ Daring Love #1] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

Shortly afterward, Ditko found work at the studio of writer-artists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, who had created Captain America and other characters. Beginning as an inker on backgrounds, Ditko was soon working with and learning from Mort Meskin, an artist whose work he had long admired. "Meskin was fabulous," Ditko once recalled. "I couldnt believe the ease with which he drew: strong compositions, loose pencils, yet complete; detail without clutter. I loved his stuff".<ref>Theakston, Steve Ditko Reader, p. 3 (unnumbered)</ref> Ditkos known assistant work includes aiding inker Meskin on the Jack Kirby pencil work of Harvey Comics Captain 3-D #1 (Dec. 1953).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=10952 Captain 3-D #1 (Dec. 1953)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> For his own third published story, Ditko penciled and inked the six-page "A Hole in His Head" in Black Magic vol. 4, #3 (Dec. 1953), published by Simon & Kirbys Crestwood Publications imprint Prize Comics.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=10906 Black Magic<nowiki> vol. 4, #3 [27] (Dec. 1953)</nowiki>] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>

Ditko then began a long association with the Derby, Connecticut publisher Charlton Comics, a low-budget division of a company best known for song-lyric magazines. Beginning with the cover of The Thing! #12 (Feb. 1954) and the eight-page vampire story "Cinderella" in that issue, Ditko would continue to work intermittently for Charlton until the companys demise in 1986, producing science fiction, horror fiction horror and mystery fiction mystery stories, as well as co-creating Captain Atom, with writer Joe Gill, in Space Adventures (comics) Space Adventures #33 (March 1960).<ref>{{cite book last=McAvennie first= Michael  editor-last=Dolan  editor-first=Hannah  chapter= 1960s title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle publisher=Dorling Kindersley year=2010 location= London, United Kingdom isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9  page= 99  quote = Captain Atom was born in a tale by artist Steve Ditko and writer Joe Gill.}}</ref> He first went on hiatus from the company, and comics altogether, in mid-1954, when he contracted tuberculosis and returned to his parents home in Johnstown to recuperate.<ref name=strangesuspense>{{cite book  editor-last=Bell  editor-first=Blake   title=Strange Suspense: The Steve Ditko Archives Vol. 1  publisher=Fantagraphics Books year= 2009 location= Seattle, Washington page= 10 isbn= 978-1-60699-289-0}}</ref>

===Marvel Comics===
After he recovered and moved back to New York City in late 1955,<ref name=strangesuspense /> Ditko began drawing for Atlas Comics (1950s) Atlas Comics, the 1950s precursor of Marvel Comics, beginning with the four-page "Therell Be Some Changes Made" in Journey into Mystery #33 (April 1956); this debut tale would be reprinted in Marvels Curse of the Weird #4 (March 1994). Ditko would go on to contribute a large number of stories, many considered classic, to Atlas/Marvels Strange Tales and the newly launched Amazing Adventures, Strange Worlds, Tales of Suspense and Tales to Astonish, issues of which would typically open with a Kirby-drawn monster story, followed by one or two twist-ending thrillers or sci-fi tales drawn by Don Heck, Paul Reinman, or Joe Sinnott, all capped by an often-surreal, sometimes self-reflexive short by Ditko and writer-editor Stan Lee.<ref>{{cite book last = Brevoort first = Tom authorlink = Tom Brevoort  editor-last=Gilbert  editor-first=Laura  chapter=1950s  title=Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History  publisher=Dorling Kindersley year = 2008 location= London  page = 73 isbn =978-0756641238}}</ref>

These Lee-Ditko short stories proved so popular that Amazing Adventures was reformatted to feature such stories exclusively beginning with issue #7 (Dec. 1961), when the comic was rechristened Amazing Adult Fantasy, a name intended to reflect its more "sophisticated" nature, as likewise the new tagline "The magazine that respects your intelligence". Lee in 2009 described these "short, five-page filler strips that Steve and I did together", originally "placed in any of our comics that had a few extra pages to fill", as "odd fantasy tales that Id dream up with O. Henry-type endings." Giving an early example of what would later be known as the "Marvel Method" of writer-artist collaboration, Lee said, "All I had to do was give Steve a one-line description of the plot and hed be off and running. Hed take those skeleton outlines I had given him and turn them into classic little works of art that ended up being far cooler than I had any right to expect."<ref>Stan Lee Lee, Stan, "Introduction", in Yoe, p. 9</ref>

====Creation of Spider-Man====
After Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Stan Lee obtained permission from publisher martin Goodman (publisher) Martin Goodman to create a new "ordinary teen" superhero named "Spider-Man",<ref>Lee, Stan, and Mair, George. Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee (Fireside, 2002), p.130. {{ISBN 0-684-87305-2}}</ref> Lee originally approached his leading artist, Jack Kirby. Kirby told Lee about his own 1950s character conception, variously called the Silver Spider and Spiderman, in which an orphaned boy finds a magic ring that gives him super powers. Comics historian Greg Theakston says Lee and Kirby "immediately sat down for a story conference" and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages. "A day or two later", Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, and, as Lee recalled, "I hated the way he was doing it. Not that he did it badly&nbsp;— it just wasnt the character I wanted; it was too heroic".<ref>Theakston, Greg. The Steve Ditko Reader (Pure Imagination, Brooklyn, New York, 2002; {{ISBN 1-56685-011-8}}), p. 12 (unnumbered)</ref>

Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual motif Lee found satisfactory,<ref>Tom DeFalco DeFalco, Tom "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 87: "Deciding that his new character would have spider-like powers, [Stan] Lee commissioned Jack Kirby to work on the first story. Unfortunately, Kirbys version of Spider-Mans alter ego Peter Parker proved too heroic, handsome, and muscular for Lees everyman hero. Lee turned to Steve Ditko, the regular artist on Amazing Adult Fantasy, who designed a skinny, awkward teenager with glasses."</ref> although Lee would later replace Ditkos original cover with one penciled by Kirby. Ditko said, "The Spider-Man pages Stan showed me were nothing like the (eventually) published character. In fact, the only drawings of Spider-Man were on the splash <nowiki>[</nowiki>i.e., page 1] and at the end [where] Kirby had the guy leaping at you with a web gun... Anyway, the first five pages took place in the home, and the kid finds a ring and turns into Spider-Man."<ref>Theakston, Steve Ditko Reader, p. 13</ref>

Ditko also recalled that, "One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldnt have hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasnt sure Stan would like the idea of covering the characters face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character...."<ref>Ditko, Steve.

Raleigh, North Carolina: TwoMorrows Publishing, 2001, p. 56. {{ISBN 978-1-893905-06-1}}</ref>

Much earlier, in a rare contemporaneous account, Ditko described his and Lees contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan #2 (Summer 1965): "Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist & spider signal". He added he would continue drawing Spider-Man "[i]f nothing better comes along."<ref name=comicfan2>{{cite web archivedate=April 30, 2008  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430081615/http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/artist/arcomicf.html  author=Ditko interview  title=Steve Ditko – A Portrait of the Master  url=http://www.ditko.comics.org/ditko/artist/arcomicf.html  publisher=Comic Fan #2 (Larry Herndon, pub.) via Ditko.Comics.org (Blake Bell, ed.)  date=Summer 1965  accessdate=April 3, 2008  deadurl=yes}} Additional , February 28, 2012.</ref> That same year, he expressed to the fanzine Voice of Comicdom, regarding a poll of "Best Liked" fan-created comics, "It seems a shame, since comics themselves have so little variety of stories and styles that you would deliberately restrict your own creative efforts to professional comics[] shallow range.

From 1958 to either 1966,<ref name=ditkostanton /> or 1968<ref name=theakston-reader-p14 /> (accounts differ), Ditko shared a Manhattan studio at 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school classmate.

Ditko, inked by George Roussos, penciled the feature through #67 (May 1965). Ditko designed the Hulks primary antagonist, the Leader (comics) Leader, in #62 (Dec. 1964).

Ditko also penciled the Iron Man feature in Tales of Suspense #47–49 (Nov. 1963&nbsp;– Jan. 1964), with various inkers. The first of these debuted the initial version of Iron Mans modern red-and-golden armor, though whether Ditko or cover-penciler and principal character designer Jack Kirby designed the costume is uncertain.

Though often overshadowed by his Amazing Spider-Man work, Ditkos "Doctor Strange" artwork has been equally acclaimed, for its surrealism surrealistic mystical landscapes and increasingly psychedelic visuals that helped make the feature a favorite of college students. "People who read Doctor Strange thought people at Marvel must be heads [i.e. drug users]," recalled then-associate editor and former Doctor Strange writer Roy Thomas in 1971, "because they had had similar experiences high on Psilocybin mushroom mushrooms.

Eventually Lee & Ditko would take Strange into ever-more-abstract realms. In an epic 17-issue story arc in Strange Tales #130–146 (March 1965 – July 1966), Lee and Ditko introduced the cosmic character Eternity (comics) Eternity, who personified the universe and was depicted as a silhouette whose outlines are filled with the cosmos.<ref name=st134>[http://www.comics.org/issue/19306/ Strange Tales #134] at the Grand Comics Database: "Indexer Notes: Part 5 of 17.

{{quote Steve Ditko contributed some of his most surrealistic work to the comic book and gave it a disorienting, hallucinogenic quality. Dr. Stranges adventures take place in bizarre worlds and twisting dimensions that resembled Salvador Dalí paintings.  ... Inspired by the pulp-fiction magicians of Stan Lees childhood as well as by contemporary Beat Generation Beat culture. Dr. Strange remarkably predicted the youth countercultures fascination with Eastern mysticism and psychedelia. Never among Marvels more popular or accessible characters, Dr. Strange still found a niche among an audience seeking a challenging alternative to more conventional superhero fare.<ref>Wright, Bradford W.

The cartoonist and fine artist Seth (cartoonist) Seth in 2003 described Ditkos style as "oddball for mainstream comics. Whereas Kirbys stuff clearly appealed to a boys sensibility because there was so much raw power, Ditkos work was really delicate and cartoony. There was a sense of design to it. You can always recognize anything that Ditko designed because its always flowery. There is a lot of embroidered detail in the art, which is almost psychedelic."<ref>Heer, Jeet.

Whichever feature he drew, Ditkos idiosyncratic, cleanly detailed, instantly recognizable art style, emphasizing mood and anxiety (mood) anxiety, found great favor with readers.

Ditkos stay at DC was short—he would work on all six issues of the Creepers own title, Beware the Creeper (June 1968 – April 1969), though leaving midway through the final one—and the reasons for his departure uncertain. But while at DC, Ditko recommended Charlton staffer Dick Giordano to the company,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2007_09_11.html  authorlink=Mark Evanier  last=Evanier  first=Mark  title=Ditko Doc  date=September 11, 2007  publisher="P.O.V.

From this time up through the mid-1970s, Ditko worked exclusively for Charlton and various alternative comics small press/independent publishers. Frank McLaughlin (artist) Frank McLaughlin, Charltons art director during this period, describes Ditko as living "in a local hotel in Derby, Connecticut Derby for a while. He was a very happy-go-lucky guy with a great sense of humor at that time, and always supplied the [female] color separators with candy and other little gifts".<ref name="CBA9">Cooke, Jon B., & Christopher Irving.

* In 1987, Ditko was presented a Comic-Con International Inkpot Award in absentia, accepted on his behalf by Renegade Press publisher Deni Loubert, who had published Ditkos World the previous year. Ditko refused the award, and returned it to Loubert after having phoned her to say, "Awards bleed the artist and make us compete against each other. They are the most horrible things in the world. How dare you accept this on my behalf". At his behest, Loubert returned the award to the convention organizers.<ref>Bell, Strange and Stranger, pp. 165–166</ref>

==BBC documentary==
In September 2007, presenter Jonathan Ross hosted a one-hour documentary for BBC Four titled In Search of Steve Ditko. The program covers Ditkos work at Marvel, DC, and Charlton Comics and at Wally Woods witzend, as well as his following of Objectivism. It includes testimonials by Alan Moore, Mark Millar, Jerry Robinson and Stan Lee, among others. Ross, accompanied by writer Neil Gaiman, met Ditko briefly at his New York office, but he declined to be filmed, interviewed or photographed. He did, however, give the two a selection of some comic books. At the end of the show, Ross said he has since spoken to Ditko on the telephone and, as a joke, that he was now on first name terms with him.<ref name=ross />
