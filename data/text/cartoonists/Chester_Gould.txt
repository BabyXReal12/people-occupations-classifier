==Dick Tracy==
In 1931, Gould was hired as a cartoonist with the Chicago Tribune and introduced Dick Tracy in the newspaper The Detroit Mirror on Sunday, October 4, 1931.<ref>{{cite book last=OConnell first=Jean Gould title=Chester Gould: A Daughters Biography of the Creator of Dick Tracy year=2007 publisher=McFarland location=US isbn=978-0-7864-2825-0 pages=5 url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-2825-0}}</ref> The original comic was based on a New York detective Gould was interested in. The comic then branched to the fictional character that became so famous.  He drew the comic strip for the next 46 years from his home in Woodstock, Illinois.

In order to keep informed of police methods, Gould took courses in forensics and investigative procedures. He was later proud of having introduced in 1946, the two-way wrist radio for Tracy, and in 1947, the closed-circuit television, both of which were later invented, though in somewhat different forms.

Goulds stories were rarely pre-planned, since he preferred to improvise stories as he drew them. While fans praised this approach as producing exciting stories, it sometimes created awkward plot developments that were difficult to resolve. In one notorious case, Gould had Tracy in an inescapable deathtrap (plot device) deathtrap with a Caisson (engineering) caisson. When Gould depicted Tracy addressing Gould personally and having the cartoonist magically extract him, publisher Joseph Medill Patterson Joseph Patterson vetoed the sequence and ordered it redrawn.  The strip also drew protests from those who felt that Mr. Goulds depiction of crime was too gruesome, that he poured on too much gore and carnage.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/12/us/chester-gould-cartoonist-dies-at-at-84.html?pagewanted=all</ref>

Later in the strips Gould period, the Tracy strip was widely criticized for being too right-wing in character and as excessively supportive of the police. Critics thought Gould ignored the rights of the accused and failed to support his agenda with an adequate story-line. The late 1950s also saw a newspaper readership growing less indulgent of Goulds politics.

For instance, Gould introduced an malodorous, tobacco-spitting character, B.O. Plenty, with little significant complaint from readers in the 1940s. However, the 1960s introduction of crooked lawyer Flyface and his relatives, surrounded by swarming flies, created a negative reader reaction strong enough for papers to drop the strip in large numbers. There was then a dramatic change in the strips setting, leaving behind the strips origins as an urban crime drama for science fiction plot elements and regular visits to the moon. An increasingly fantastic procession of enemies and stories ensued. The Apollo 11 moon landing prompted Gould to abandon this phase. Finally, Dick Tracy was beset by the overall trend in newspaper comics away from strips with continuing storylines and toward those whose stories are largely resolved within one series of panels.

Gould, his characters, and improbable plots were satirized in Al Capps comic strip Lil Abner with the Fearless Fosdick sequences (supposedly drawn by "Lester Gooch"); a notable villain was Bomb Face, a gangster whose head was a bomb.

==Books==
In 1983, two years before Goulds death, his only child, Jean Gould OConnell, recorded extensive interviews with her father, who spoke at length about his early attempts during the 1920s to get syndicated and the birth of Dick Tracy. These interviews became a major source when she wrote his biography, Chester Gould: A Daughters Biography of the Creator of Dick Tracy, published by McFarland in 2007. A resident of Geneva, Illinois, Jean Gould OConnell contributed to the Dick Tracy storylines, appeared as a character in the strip and helped create the Chester Gould-Dick Tracy Museum. Her book was an Edgar Award nominee in 2008.

The entire run of Dick Tracy is being reprinted in a book series by IDW Publishing. The series began in 2006. The first volume includes the five sample strips that Gould used to sell his strip, followed by over 450 strips showing the series beginning (from October 1931&nbsp;– May 1933), along with a Gould interview, never previously published, by Max Allan Collins. Twenty-two more volumes in this series have published between 2006 and 2017, bringing the continuity to July 1967.
