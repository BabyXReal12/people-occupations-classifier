On December 5, 2006, Universal Press Syndicate issued a press release stating that Amends strip, FoxTrot, would turn into a Sunday-only strip.  Amend stated that he wants to continue doing the strip, but at a less hurried pace.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.amuniversal.com/ups/newsrelease/?view=468 title=Universal Uclick - Home publisher= deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210065602/http://www.amuniversal.com/ups/newsrelease/?view=468 archivedate=2008-02-10 df=}}</ref>  This news was followed by several weeks of the characters discussing a "cartoonist" semi-retiring to Sundays only, and what methods he would use to phase out the daily strips.  The last daily FoxTrot cartoon was printed on December 30, 2006.
Amend also sometimes does guest strips for webcomics. He has done so once for PVP by Scott Kurtz and at least twice for Penny Arcade by Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins. Also at least once for XKCD, but he had to use sudo to get the rights to do so. <ref>https://xkcd.com/824/</ref>
