==Career==
===Career beginnings===
====Cannibal! The Musical (1992–94)====
In 1992, Parker, Stone, McHugh, and Ian Hardin founded a production company named the Avenging Conscience, named after the D.W. Griffith The Avenging Conscience film by the same name, which was actively disliked by the group.<ref name=WW>{{cite web last=Roberts first=Michael title=The South Park Anniversary: The First Trey Parker-Matt Stone Interview url=http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2007/08/the_south_park_anniversary_the.php publisher=Westword accessdate=25 March 2014}}</ref> Parker again employed the cutout paper technique on Avenging Consciences first production, Jesus vs. Frosty (1992), an animated short pitting the religious figure against Frosty the Snowman.

The quartet created a three-minute Trailer (film) trailer for a fictional film titled Alferd Packer: The Musical. The idea was based on an obsession Parker had with Alfred Packer, a real nineteenth-century prospecting prospector accused of cannibalism.<ref name=ny/> During this time, Parker had become engaged to long-time girlfriend Lianne Adamo, but their relationship fell apart shortly before production on the trailer had begun.<ref name=ny/> "Horribly depressed", Parker funneled his frustrations with her into the project, naming Packers "beloved but disloyal" horse after her.<ref name=ny/><ref name="cannibalSS">{{cite news url=http://splitsider.com/2011/03/cannibal-matt-stone-and-trey-parkers-original-twisted-musical/ title=Cannibal!: Matt Stone and Trey Parkers Original Twisted Musical author= Joshua Kurp  date=March 29, 2011 work=Splitsider publisher=The Awl accessdate=July 1, 2014}}</ref> The trailer became somewhat of a sensation among students at the school, leading Virgil Grillo, the chairman and founder of the universitys film department, to convince the quartet to expand it to a feature-length film.<ref name=cannibalSS/> Parker wrote the films script, creating an Oklahoma!-style musical featuring ten original show tunes.<ref name="nonesuch"/> The group raised $125,000 from family and friends and began shooting the film.

Parker told McHugh he had a "vision" they needed to be at the festival, which resulted in the group renting out a conference room in a nearby hotel and putting on their own screenings.<ref name=ny/> MTV did a short news segment on The Big Picture regarding the film,<ref name=WW/> and they made industry connections through the festival.<ref name="Playboy"/><ref name="ny">{{cite news url=http://nymag.com/arts/theater/features/south-park-2011-3/ title=Latter-Day Saints author= Carl Swanson  date=March 7, 2011 work=New York (magazine) New York publisher=New York Media, LLC accessdate=July 1, 2014}}</ref> They intended to sell video rights to the film for $1 million and spend the remaining $900,000 to create another film.<ref name="Playboy"/> The film was instead sold to Troma Entertainment in 1996 where it was retitled Cannibal!

Following the films success, the group, sans Hardin, moved to Los Angeles.<ref name="nonesuch"/> Upon arrival, they met a lawyer for the William Morris Agency who connected them with producer Scott Rudin. As a result, the duo acquired a lawyer, an agent, and a script deal.<ref name="Playboy"/> Despite initially believing themselves to be on the verge of success, the duo struggled for several years.

While at Fox, executive Brian Graden cut Parker and Stone a personal check of a few thousand dollars to produce a video greeting card he could deliver to friends; the film would be a sequel to their earlier short Jesus vs. Frosty.<ref name="nonesuch"/>  Graden sent the film on a VHS to several industry executives in Hollywood; meanwhile, someone digitized the clip and put it up on the Internet, where it became one of the very first viral videos.<ref name="cnn" /><ref name="nonesuch"/><ref name="time2">{{cite news author=Jeffrey Ressner and James Collins title=Gross And Grosser work=Time (magazine) Time date=March 23, 1998 url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988028-2,00.html accessdate=April 28, 2009}}</ref> As Jesus vs. Santa became more popular, Parker and Stone began talks of developing the short into a television series.

In a September 2006 edition of the ABC News program Nightline, Parker expressed his views on religion, stating that he Belief in God believes in "a God" and that "there is knowledge that humanity does not yet possess" while cautioning that it would take a long time to explain exactly what he meant by his belief in God. Parker believes all religions are "silly". He states that "All the religions are superfunny to me… The story of Jesus makes no sense to me. God sent his only son. Why could God only have one son and why would he have to die? Its just bad writing, really. And its really terrible in about the second act." Parker further remarked, <blockquote>Basically… out of all the ridiculous religion stories which are greatly, wonderfully ridiculous—the silliest one Ive ever heard is, Yeah… theres this big giant universe and its Metric expansion of space expanding, its all gonna Big Crunch collapse on itself and were all just here just cause… just <nowiki></nowiki>cause. That, to me, is the most ridiculous explanation ever.<ref>Jake Tapper and Dan Morris (September 22, 2006).

<blockquote>What were sick of—and its getting even worse—is: you either like Michael Moore or you wanna fuckin go overseas and shoot Iraqis. There cant be a middle ground. Basically, if you think Michael Moores full of shit, then you are a super-Christianity Christian Right-wing politics right-wing whatever. And were both just pretty middle-ground guys. We find just as many things to rip on on the Left-wing politics left as we do on the right. People on the Far-left politics far left and the Far-right politics far right are Horseshoe theory the same exact person to us.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/trey-parker-and-matt-stone-talk-team-america-world-police title=Trey Parker and Matt Stone talk Team America: World Police date=October 4, 2004 publisher= accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref></blockquote>
