Kim Deitch (born May 21, 1944<ref name = WhosWho /> in Los Angeles)<ref name=Apex>Donahue, Don and Susan Goodrick, editors. Deitch bio, The Apex Treasuet of Underground Comics (Apex Novelties, 1974), p. 127.</ref> is an People of the United States American cartoonist who was an important figure in the underground comix movement of the 1960s, remaining active in the decades that followed with a variety of books and comics, sometimes using the pseudonym Fowlton Means.

Much of Kim Deitchs work deals with the animation industry and characters from the world of cartoons.<ref name=lam>[http://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/deitch.htm Kim Deitch] at the Lambiek Comiclopedia. Retrieved on November 12, 2013. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150907063815/https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/deitch.htm Archived] from the original on September 7, 2013.</ref> His best-known character is a mysterious cat named Waldo, who appears variously as a famous cartoon character of the 1930s, as an actual character in the "reality" of the strips, as the hallucination of a hopeless alcoholic surnamed Mishkin (a victim of the The Boulevard of Broken Dreams (comics) Boulevard of Broken Dreams), as the demonic reincarnation of Judas Iscariot; and who, occasionally, is claimed to have overcome Deitch and written the comics himself. Waldos appearance is reminiscent of such black cat characters as Felix the Cat, Julius the Cat, and Krazy Kat.

The son of illustrator and animator Gene Deitch, Kim Deitch has sometimes worked with his brothers Simon Deitch and Seth Deitch.<ref name=lam />
