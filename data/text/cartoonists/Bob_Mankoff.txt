Robert "Bob" Mankoff (born May 1, 1944
) is an United States American cartoonist, editor, and author. He was the cartoon editor for The New Yorker magazine from 1997 to April 29, 2017.
Before he succeeded Lee Lorenz as cartoon editor, Mankoff was a cartoonist for The New Yorker for twenty years.

==Early life==
Mankoff grew up in Queens, New York, and attended Music and Art High School
(graduating in 1962) and Syracuse University (graduating in 1966).
==Career==
Mankoff submitted more than 500 cartoons to The New Yorker for over two years before he had his first one published
in 1977.
One of his cartoons (captioned "No, Thursdays out. How about never—is never good for you?") is one of The New Yorkers most widely reprinted cartoons.
In 1992, Mankoff founded the online Cartoon Bank,
a licensing platform for New Yorker cartoons and art, with more than 85,000 cartoons available for sale. Mankoff was hired as New Yorker cartoon editor in 1997;
he credits his administration of the Cartoon Bank as being an important reason for why he was chosen to replace Lorenz.
Tina Brown, The New Yorkers editor at the time, said of Mankoff, "Bob is not only a brilliant cartoonist himself, hes also an impassioned promoter, defender and curator of the art of cartooning. … Hes put himself out to nurture cartoonists."
Mankoff has stated that his all-time favorite New Yorker cartoonist is Jack Ziegler.
He has also cited Shel Silverstein as an artist he would have liked as a contributing cartoonist.
Under Mankoff, the magazine has brought in a new generation of cartoonists (including a number of female contributors); notable names include Pat Byrnes, J. C. Duffy, P. C. Vey, Farley Katz, Emily Flake, and  Julia Suits. Mankoff usually contributes a short article to each issue of The New Yorker, describing some aspect of the cartooning process or the methods used to select cartoons for the magazine.{{citation needed date=April 2013}}

Under Mankoffs stewardship, in April 2005 the magazine began using the last page of each issue for the subsequently very popular "The New Yorker Cartoon Caption contest Caption Contest" (prior that date, the Caption Contest had appeared as a back-page feature in the magazines annual "Cartoon Issue"). Mankoff himself contributes cartoons to Moment (magazine) Moment magazines own monthly cartoon caption contest.
As a lecturer on the appreciation of humor, Mankoff is represented by the Leigh Bureau.
Mankoff is mentioned in MC Paul Barmans song "Cock Mobster" on the 2002 album Paullelujah!
In April 2017, Mankoff left The New Yorker and was named Humor and Cartoon Editor at Esquire (magazine) Esquire magazine on May 1, 2017.
==Personal life ==
Mankoff and his wife Cory live in Briarcliff Manor, New York; they have one daughter together, Sarah. Cory also had a son who died in 2012.
== Films ==
The 2015 documentary, Very Semi-Serious, presents a behind-the-scenes look at the cartoons of The New Yorker, and features glimpses into Mankoffs career, his role at The New Yorker, and his personal life.  The film was produced by Redora Films.
