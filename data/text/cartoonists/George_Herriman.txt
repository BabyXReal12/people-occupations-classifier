George Joseph Herriman (August&nbsp;22, 1880&nbsp;– April&nbsp;25, 1944) was an American cartoonist best known for the comic strip Krazy Kat (1913–1944).  More influential than popular, Krazy Kat had an appreciative audience among those in the arts. Gilbert Seldes article "The Krazy Kat Who Walks by Himself" was the earliest example of a critic from the high arts giving serious attention to a comic strip. The Comics Journal placed the strip first on its list of the greatest comics of the 20th century. Herrimans work has been a primary influence on cartoonists such as Will Eisner, Charles M. Schulz, Robert Crumb, Art Spiegelman, Bill Watterson, and Chris Ware.

Herriman was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to mulatto Louisiana Creole people Creole parents, and grew up in Los Angeles.  After he graduated from high school in 1897, he worked in the newspaper industry as an illustrator and engraver.  He moved on to cartooning and comic strips—a medium then in its infancy—and drew a variety of strips until he introduced his most famous character, Krazy Kat, in his strip The Dingbat Family in 1910.  A Krazy Kat daily strip began in 1913, and from 1916 the strip also appeared on Sundays.  It was noted for its poetic, dialect-heavy dialogue; its fantastic, shifting backgrounds; and its bold, experimental page layouts.  In the strips main motif, Ignatz Mouse pelted Krazy with bricks, which the naïve, Androgyny androgynous Kat interpreted as symbols of love.  As the strip progressed, a love triangle developed between Krazy, Ignatz, and Offisa Pupp.

Herriman lived most of his life in Los Angeles, but made frequent trips to the Navajo deserts in the southwestern U.S.  He was drawn to the landscapes of Monument Valley and the Enchanted Mesa, and made Coconino County, Arizona Coconino County the location of his Krazy Kat strips.  His artwork made much use of Navajo people Navajo and Mexican themes and motifs against shifting desert backgrounds.  He was a prolific cartoonist who produced a large number of strips and illustrated Don Marquiss books of poetry about Archy and Mehitabel, an alley cat and a cockroach.  Newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst was a proponent of Herriman and gave him a lifetime contract with King Features Syndicate, which guaranteed Herriman a comfortable living and an outlet for his work despite its lack of popularity.

His father worked there as a tailor.  Herriman attended the Catholic boys school St. Vincents College (now Loyola High School (Los Angeles) Loyola High School).{{sfn Mostrom 2010}} Soon after graduating in 1897, he sold a sketch of the Hotel Petrolia in Santa Paula, California Santa Paula to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner Los Angeles Herald.

A short, fat man labeled "Parker" and a tall, thin man labeled "Herrin" are in a farmyard, whose barn is labeled "Republican Stables".  The two are looking at a horse with a human face and an enormous collar.  The horse is labeled "Gillett".  The caption reads, "Parker: Will he stand without hitching?; Herrin: Sure! See that collar?" Herrimans earliest published work was humor and editorial cartoons. (September 7, 1906)

When he was 20, Herriman sneaked aboard a freight train bound for New York City, hoping his chances as an artist would be better there.  He was unsuccessful at first, and survived by working as a barker (occupation) barker and billboard painter at Coney Island, until one of the leading humor magazines of the day, Judge (magazine) Judge, accepted some of his cartoons.  Between June 15 and October 26, 1901, eleven of his cartoons appeared in that magazines pages, in the heavily Hatching crosshatched style of the day.  He often used sequential images in his cartoons, as in the emerging comic strip medium.  On September 29 that year, his first real comic strips were published, one in the Pulitzer, Inc. Pulitzer chain of newspapers on a non-contractual, one-shot basis and another on a continuing basis in the Philadelphia North American Syndicates first comic strip supplement.  His first color comic strips appeared in the McClure Newspaper Syndicate T. C. McClure Syndicate beginning October 20.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=33}}

His success with these syndicated strips convinced Herriman to give up on magazine submissions.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 pp=33–34}}  For the Pulitzer papers on February 16, 1902, he began his first strip that had a continuing character, Musical Mose. The strip featured an African American African-American musician who impersonated other ethnicities, only to suffer the consequences when discovered by his audience.  Professor Otto and his Auto, about a terrifyingly dangerous driver, followed in March, and  Acrobatic Archie, a "kid strip" with a child protagonist, first appeared in April.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=34}} With his future as a cartoonist seemingly assured, Herriman traveled back to Los Angeles to marry his childhood sweetheart and returned with her to New York.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=36}}

In the November 1902 issue of the literary magazine The Bookman (New York) The Bookman Herriman wrote of his profession self-deprecatingly, while poet La Touche Hancock, in an article in that issue titled "The American Comic and Caricature Art",{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=36}} wrote, "Art and poetry is the characteristic of George Herriman.  Were his drawings not so well known one would think he had mistaken his vocation."{{sfnm 1a1=Hancock 1y=1902 1p=263 2a1=McDonnell 2a2=OConnell 2a3=Havenon 2y=1986 2p=36}} Herrimans work was increasing in popularity, and he occasionally had front-page, full-color strips for the Pulitzer supplements, such as Two Jolly Jackies about two unemployed sailors, which began in January 1903.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 pp=36–37}}  He began drawing the cowboy strip Lariat Pete in September for the McClure syndicate after Two Jolly Jackies was ended.{{sfn Blackbeard 1983 p=51}}

The comic strip Major Ozones Fresh Air Crusade (1904–1906) was an early success for Herriman. (April&nbsp;21,&nbsp;1906)

In June, Herriman was employed by the New York World.  There, he illustrated Roy McCardells commentaries on local events, beginning June 28 and running to the years end.  Herriman still produced syndicate work, such as Major Ozones Fresh Air Crusade for the World Color Printing Company beginning January 2, 1904.  Another of Herrimans obsessive characters, the Major traveled the world in an unsuccessful search for the purest air and spouted poetic dialogue.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=37}}  Major Ozone was so popular that it soon was given the supplements front page.{{sfn Blackbeard 1983 p=51}}  The same month, Herriman moved from the World to the Daily News (New York) New York Daily News, where he was given a larger quantity and variety of work, including cartoon reporting on sports and politics.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=37}}  In February and March, he had a short-lived continuing character comic strip about domestic life called Home Sweet Home. That spring, he began illustrating a series of articles written by Walter Murphy called Bubblespikers.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=41}}

Rudolph Block hired Herriman for the William Randolph Hearst Hearst papers with "a salary commensurate with his talents", starting April 22 at the New York Journal-American New York American,{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=41}} which ran no daily comic strips at the time.{{sfn Blackbeard 1983 p=51}}  Herriman drew sports cartoons in an office alongside Frederick Burr Opper, Jimmy Swinnerton James Swinnerton,{{sfnm 1a1=Blackbeard 1y=1983 1p=51 2a1=McDonnell 2a2=OConnell 2a3=Havenon 2y=1986 2p=41}} and Tad Dorgan, who was popularly known as "Tad" and was considered a star at another Hearst paper, the New York Journal-American New York Evening Journal.  Tad and Herriman were often assigned to cover the same sporting events and became close friends. In 1924, Tad called Herriman "one of the best sporting artists in the world" and regretted that Herriman no longer did that kind of work.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 pp=41, 44–45}}  Herriman continued with Hearst until June 1905, when he left the paper,{{sfnm 1a1=McDonnell 1a2=OConnell 1a3=Havenon 1y=1986 1pp=44–45 2a1=Blackbeard 2y=1983 2p=52}} possibly because of the new sports editors unsympathetic attitude to cartoonists.{{sfn Blackbeard 1983 p=52}}  He returned to Los Angeles{{sfnm 1a1=McDonnell 1a2=OConnell 1a3=Havenon 1y=1986 1pp=44–45 2a1=Mostrom 2y=2010 3a1=Blackbeard 3y=1983 3p=53}} in the latter half of 1905.{{sfn Blackbeard 1983 p=53}}

In California, Herriman continued to mail in work to the World Color Printing Company.  He revived Major Ozone and produced Grandmas Girl—Likewise Bud Smith, which he combined from two earlier strips, and a two-tiered childrens strip, Rosy Posy—Mamas Girl.  He began to work with the Los Angeles Times on January 8, 1906, before returning to Hearst that summer.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=45}}  Accompanying a front-page illustration in Hearsts Los Angeles Herald-Examiner Los Angeles Examiner, Herriman was announced as "the Examiner{{}}s cartoonist" on August 21.  His artwork began to appear on nearly every page, resulting in greatly increased sales for the newspaper.{{sfnm 1a1=McDonnell 1a2=OConnell 1a3=Havenon 1y=1986 1p=45 2a1=Blackbeard 2y=1983 2p=54}}  In October, he stopped working for World Color.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=45}}

Following the success of Bud Fishers daily strip Mutt and Jeff A. Mutt,{{sfn Harvey 1994 p=242}}{{efn Herriman may also have been inspired by the earlier daily strip A.

In 1910, the sports editor of the New York Evening Journal called Herriman back to New York to cover for Tad Dorgan who was in San Francisco covering the Jack Johnson (boxer)#The "Fight of the Century" "Fight of the Century" between Jack Johnson (boxer) Jack Johnson and James J. Jeffries Jim Jeffries.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=50}}  Six days after arriving in New York, Herriman began The Dingbat Family, starring E. Pluribus Dingbat and his family.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=51}}  Herriman used typed lettering on the strip on July 26, 1910, but quickly went back to hand-lettering.{{sfnm 1a1=Nel 1y=2012 1p=284 2a1=McDonnell 2a2=OConnell 2a3=Havenon 2y=1986 2p=55}} On August 10, 1910, Herriman retitled the strip The Family Upstairs.<ref name=toonopedia>[https://www.webcitation.org/6XFvJF7LA?url=http://toonopedia.com/dingbat.htm The Dingbat Family a.k.a.

Critics do not regard the strip highly, but it provided the vehicle for a fruitful situation: in the July 26 episode, a mouse threw a brick at the family cat—called "Kat"—which hit the cat on the head.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=51}}  The antics of this mouse and "Kat" continued to appear in the bottom portion of The Dingbat Family.  Herriman said he did this "to fill up the waste space".{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=51}}  About a month after its first appearance, the "Kat" crept up on the sleeping mouse and kissed it loudly.  The mouse awoke saying, "I dreamed an angel kissed me", while the "Kat" crept away and said, "Sweet thing".{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 pp=52, 54}}

The gender of "Kat" was unclear from the start.  Herriman experimented with a decision about the characters gender, but it remained ambiguous and he would refer to "Kat" as "he" or "she" as he saw fit. Herriman incorporated unusual details into the mini-strips backgrounds—cacti, pagodas, fanciful vegetation, or anything else that struck his fancy; this became a signature of the later Krazy Kat strip.  The cast grew and soon included the mainstay character Bull Pupp and characters from the Gooseberry Sprigg strip.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=54}}  The strips characters, relations and situations grew organically during its lifetime, encouraged by Herrimans colleagues.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 pp=54, 56}}

The cat-and-mouse substrip was gaining in popularity; instead of filling up space in the bottom of The Dingbat Family{{}}s panels, it began to occupy a tier of panels of its own.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=57}} In July 1912, while Herriman had the Dingbats on vacation, Krazy Kat and Ignatz Mouse took over the strip, which was retitled Krazy Kat and I. Mouse for the duration.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=59}}  On October 28, 1913, Krazy Kat debuted as an independent strip on the daily comics page.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=57}}

During the first few years of publication, Krazy Kat{{}}s humor changed from slapstick to a more Vaudeville vaudevillian kind.  The shifting backgrounds became increasingly bizarre, presaging things to come.  The strip expanded to a full-page black-and-white Sunday strip on April 23, 1916.{{efn April 23, 1916, was actually a Saturday.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=58}} }}  Herriman made full use of his imagination and used the whole page in the strips layout.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=58}}  The strips were unlike anything else on the comics page; spontaneous, formally daring, yet impeccably composed.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=61}}

Herriman visited Monument Valley in Arizona and similar places in New Mexico and southern Utah, and incorporated the distinct forms of the desert landscape into his strips. The Enchanted Mesa of New Mexico first appeared in Krazy Kat in the summer of 1916.  Herriman may have visited after reading an article by Theodore Roosevelt in 1913, but he may have gone earlier—the desert Coconino County, Arizona Coconino County, Arizona, that became the backdrop to Krazy Kat was first mentioned in a 1911 The Dingbat Family strip,{{sfn Harvey 2010}} though the real Coconino County was located further southwest than Herrimans fanciful version.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=69}}

The Dingbat Family finished in 1916 and was replaced by Baron Bean{{}}s debut the next day.  The strips title character, The Baron, was an impoverished English nobleman, a tramp inspired by Charles Dickens and Charlie Chaplin.  He and his valet Grimes would plot ways to get by.  Herriman later introduced the main characters wives, and after a run as a domestic strip, with occasional appearances of characters from Krazy Kats world, it ended in January 1919.  It was replaced the next day by Now Listen Mabel, which was about a young man courting a young woman; he would be caught in a compromising situation, which he would try to explain away with "Now listen Mabel..."  The strip lasted until that December.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 pp=57–58}}

{{Quote box "It happens that in America irony and fantasy are practised in the major arts by only one or two men, producing high-class trash; and Mr Herriman, working in a despised medium, without an atom of pretentiousness, is day after day producing something essentially fine.

Krazy Kat gained an appreciative audience in the world of the arts.  The character debuted in film in 1916.

Hearst, an admirer of Krazy Kat, had given Herriman a lifetime contract with his company King Features Syndicate,{{sfnm 1a1=Wolk 1y=2008 1p=353 2a1=McDonnell 2a2=OConnell 2a3=Havenon 2y=1986 2p=68 3a1=Gabilliet 3a2=Beaty 3a3=Nguyen 3y=2010 p=}} which gave Herriman the security to live anywhere he wanted.  In 1922, he moved back to Hollywood,{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=68}} into a two-story Spanish-style home at 1617 North Sierra Bonita,{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=76}} from where he made frequent visits to the Arizona desert.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=68}}  Herriman developed ties with members of the film industry; he knew Hal Roach Studio members Tom McNamara (director) Tom McNamara and H. M. Walker "Beanie" Walker from their newspaper days.  Walker, Herrimans best friend, was the head writer on the Our Gang shorts.  In the early 1920s, Herriman occasionally drew his strips at the Roach Studio.  He met celebrities, including Will Rogers and Frank Capra, and presented them with hand-colored drawings.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=76}}  He loved Charlie Chaplins films, and reviewed The Gold Rush in the magazine Motion Picture Classics in October 1925.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=77}}

At the top, a middle-aged caucasian male, leaning over the railing to a staircase, says to an African-American male, "Ive looked everywhere for Owl-Eye, Soda—do you know where he is?"  The African-American, carrying a broom over his shoulder and descending the staircase, replies, "No, Boss, Ah aint laid eyes on him fo the lass half hour". Stumble Inn ran from 1922 until 1925 (December 23, 1922).

Autumn 1922 saw the first daily installment of Stumble Inn, the first non-Krazy Kat strip Herriman had drawn since 1919.  A verbose strip whose Sundays were often overrun with prose, its lead characters were Uriah and Ida Stumble, who rented rooms to an assortment of strange characters.  The daily strip was short-lived, but the Sundays edition lasted three years.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 pp=67–68}}

From August 1925 until September 1929, King Features required that Herriman design the Krazy Kat Sundays so that they could be run either as a full Sunday page or as two four-panel dailies.  Herriman lamented intrusion on his page designs, and the artwork of the period took on a rushed look.  He was made to focus on the strips characterization, and during this period, the Krazy—Ignatz—Offisa Pupp love triangle for which the strip is remembered became fully developed.  Pupp pined for Krazy, Krazy loved Ignatz, and Ignatz hated Krazy and pelted the annoying "Kat" with a brick, and Pupp imprisoned Ignatz.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 pp=77–78}}

Throughout the late 1920s, Herriman made frequent trips to Kayenta, Arizona, in Navajo people Navajo country about {{convert 25 mi km}} from Monument Valley.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=69}}  He also made winter trips to Mexico.  The desert, Navajo artwork, and Mexican pottery and architecture became more prominent in Herrimans strips, and he sometimes used Spanish vocabulary in the dialogue.  Herriman did little work on these excursions, and it is likely that he drew his strips in hurried bursts when in Hollywood.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 pp=78–79}}

Stumble Inn finished in late 1925, and it was replaced with the domestic strip Us Husbands (with Mistakes Will Happen as a "Topper (comic strip) topper" strip), which ran until the end of that year.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=80}}  In 1928, Herriman took over the strip Embarrassing Moments, which had begun in 1922 and had been drawn by several cartoonists.  The strip eventually became Bernie Burns, in which embarrassing moments would happen to the title character.  The strip appeared in few papers, and after it ended in 1932, Herriman worked only on Krazy Kat, although he provided illustrations for Don Marquis popular Archy and Mehitabel, a series of books of poetry about a cat and a cockroach.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=80}}

In 1930, Herriman sold his first Hollywood home to a friend and moved his family to 2217 Maravilla Drive, a Spanish-style mansion atop a hill.  It was adorned with paintings of Southwest and Native themes, and had a Mexican-style garden paved with flagstones and decorated with painted pots and tropical plants.  Herriman later bought the lot across the street and turned it into a public park.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 pp=80–81}}

The 1930s were a period of tragedy for Herriman.  On September 29, 1931, his wife Mabel died after an automobile accident,{{sfnm 1a1=Los Angeles Times staff 1y=1931 2a1=Chicago Daily Tribune staff 2y=1931}} and in 1939, his youngest daughter Bobbie died unexpectedly at 30.  After his wifes death, Herriman never remarried and lived in Los Angeles with his cats and dogs.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=81}}  He developed a close relationship with cartoonist James Swinnertons first wife Louise, with whom he frequently exchanged letters.  Herriman underwent a kidney operation in spring 1938, and during his ten-week convalescence King Features reran old Krazy Kat strips.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=86}}

Krazy Kat{{}}s popularity fell considerably over the years, and by the 1930s it was running in only thirty-five newspapers, while its contemporaries such as Bringing Up Father were reportedly running in up to a thousand.  Herriman realized his $750-per-week salary from Hearsts King Features Syndicate was far more than the revenue the strip could be generating, but Hearst refused Herrimans offer to take a pay cut.  Hearst let it be known that Herriman was to continue the strip as long as he liked.{{sfn Sorel 1992 p=24}}  From 1935, Krazy Kat appeared in color, of which Herriman made bold use.  He reduced the amount of hatchwork and used larger, more open panels.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=81}}

Herriman died in his sleep in his home near Hollywood on April 25, 1944, after a long illness.{{sfnm 1a1=New York Times staff 1y=1944 2a1=Time staff 2y=1944}} An incompletely inked penciling of a weeks worth of daily strips was found on his drawing board. On his death certificate, the cause of death was listed as "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver",{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=219}} and despite his mixed-race heritage, he was listed as "caucasian".{{sfnm 1a1=Elam 1y=2011 1p=79 2a1=Heer 2y=2005}} The New York Journal-American ran a front-page obituary.{{sfn Sorel 1992 p=25}} His funeral at Little Church of Flowers at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) Forest Lawn Memorial Park was attended by few.  Cartoonist Harry Hershfield spoke at the funeral, saying, "If ever there was a saint on earth, it was George Herriman".{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=88}} According to his request, his body was cremated and his remains were scattered over Monument Valley.{{sfnm  1a1=McDonnell  1a2=OConnell  1a3=Havenon  1y=1986  1p=88  2a1=Harvey  2y=2010}}

On June 25, 1944, two months after Herrimans death, the last of his completed Krazy Kat strips, a full-page Sunday, was printed.{{sfn Boxer 2012}}  At the time, Hearst usually engaged new cartoonists when the artists of popular strips quit or died, but he made an exception for Herriman, as he felt that no one could take his place.{{sfn Lyons 1944}}

Herriman was described as self-deprecatingly modest, and he disliked being photographed.{{sfn Mostrom 2010}}  The New York Journal-American{{}}s obituary described him as a devoted husband and father, of slight build, mild-mannered and an anonymous contributor to charities.{{sfnm 1a1=Sorel 1y=1992 1p=25 2a1=McDonnell 2a2=OConnell 2a3=Havenon 2y=1986 2p=86}}  He was generous to his friends, and sold his first Hollywood house, which he had bought for $50,000, to a friend for $40,000.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=81}} Though a private person, he was said to be an entertaining host to his friends.  He would sometimes stay silent during social occasions and would often leave the room to wash dishes, which he said he enjoyed as it gave him the opportunity to think.  His favorite game was poker, which he particularly enjoyed playing with his fellow cartoonists.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=37}}

Herriman had a great love of animals, and had a large number of dogs and cats;{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=81}} he had five dogs and thirteen cats in 1934.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=50}}  He usually kept to a vegetarian diet, except when it made him feel too weak, and he refused to ride horses.  He so admired Henry Fords pacifist stance that he would only buy Ford Motor Company Ford automobiles. He purchased a new model annually.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=86}}

Herriman married his childhood sweetheart Mabel Lillian Bridge in Los Angeles on July 7, 1902.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=36}}  They had two daughters: Mabel, nicknamed "Toodles", later "Toots") and Barbara, nicknamed "Bobbie",{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=37}} who had epilepsy.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=81}}

File:Herriman 1902.png right thumb upright alt=A black and white photograph showing an early middle-aged man with short, uncovered Afro-textured hair posing in a suit. Herriman, who had mulatto heritage, kept his "Afro-textured hair kinky hair" under a hat (1902).

Herriman was born to mixed-race parents,{{sfn Heer 2005}} and his birth certificate lists Herriman as "colored".{{sfn Boxer 2007}}  In the post- Plessy v. Ferguson U.S., in which "separate but equal" racial segregation was enshrined, people of mixed race had to choose to identify themselves as either black or white.  Herriman seems to have identified himself as white. According to comics academic Jeet Heer, his early work is "replete with black caricatures", such as Musical Mose, in which the lead character, an African-American musician, wishes his "color would fade".{{sfn Heer 2005}}  Racial ambivalence crept into Krazy Kat, such as on two occasions where Krazys black fur was dyed white.  Ignatz falls in love with the whitened Krazy, only to return to hatred and brick-throwing when the truth is revealed.  Similarly, in an oft-repeated joke, Ignatz would accidentally become covered with coal dust and would be spurned by the normally love-struck Krazy.  In one such episode, a brick thrown by the blackened Ignatz hits Krazy, who declares, "A lil Eetiopium Mice, black like a month from midnights.  Fuwi!"{{efn "A little Ethiopian Mouse, black like a month of midnights.  Phooey!"}} Once Ignatz reverts to his white self, Krazy loves him again.{{sfn Stern 2008}}

Herrimans ethnic heritage was unknown to his colleagues.  Fellow cartoonist Tad Dorgan nicknamed him "the Greek", a label which stuck and was taken up by his biographers and the press, who called him the son of a Greek baker.{{sfn Heer 2005}}  At other times, he was identified as French, Irish, and Turkish.{{sfn Heer 2011}}  He told a friend that he was Creole, and speculated that he may have "Negro blood" in him, as he had "Afro-textured hair kinky hair".{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=30}}  The friend said that Herriman wore a hat to hide his hair,{{sfn Heer 2005}} which may have been an attempt to Passing (racial identity) pass as white.{{sfn Amiran 2000 p=56}}  Herriman said that he dreamed of being reborn a Navajo.{{sfn Heer 2011}}  On his death certificate, he was listed as "Caucasian",{{sfnm 1a1=Elam 1y=2011 1p=79 2a1=Heer 2y=2005}} and his daughter Mabel had his fathers birthplace listed as Paris and his mothers as Alsace-Lorraine.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=30}}

Sociologist Arthur Asa Berger made Herrimans mixed-race heritage known in 1971.  While researching for Herrimans entry for the Dictionary of American Biography,  Berger discovered the cartoonists race was listed as "colored" on his birth certificate obtained from the New Orleans Board of Health.  The 1880 census for New Orleans listed his parents as "mulatto".{{sfn Inge 1996 pp=2–3}}  On reading this, African-American poet Ishmael Reed dedicated his 1972 novel Mumbo Jumbo (novel) Mumbo Jumbo to "George Herriman, Afro-American, who created Krazy Kat".  Herriman came to be identified as Black or Creole in comics literature, including his first book-length biography, Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman (1986),{{sfn Inge 1996 p=4}} while the "Greek" label stuck with some biographers, and was used by Bill Blackbeard in his introductions to the Krazy and Ignatz volumes in the early 2000s.{{sfn Harvey 2003 p=60}} Later research at the New Orleans Public Library by cartoonist Brian Nelson showed that Herrimans maternal grandmother was born in Havana, Cuba, that all his relatives were listed as "mulatto" on the 1890 census, and that Herriman may also have had Spanish or Native American ancestry.{{sfn Stern 2008}}

==Reception and legacy==

File:E. E. Cummings NYWTS.jpg right thumb upright alt=A black and white photograph of a man in late middle-age wearing a dark cowboy hat, white shirt, tie, gray jacket, scarf and gray trousers. He faces left and his left hand is in his trouser pocket. {{not a typo E.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Cummings}} wrote the introduction to the first Krazy Kat book in 1946.

Krazy Kat was popular with intellectuals, artists and critics,{{sfn Kramer 1982}}{{efn Writers and artists such as T.&nbsp;S. Eliot,{{sfnm 1a1=Sabin 1y=2002 2a1=Mostrom 2y=2010}} Pablo Picasso,{{sfn Sabin 2002}} Gertrude Stein{{sfn Mostrom 2010}} Joan Miró, Jack Kerouac, {{not a typo E.&nbsp;E.

Writer E.&nbsp;B. White praised Herrimans illustrations for Archy and Mehitabel.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=80}}  Cartoonist Edward Sorel wrote that Krazy Kat{{}}s lack of popularity later in its run was largely due to Hearsts editorial policies, in that the "Low culture lowbrow" readership at whom he aimed his papers was unlikely to appreciate Herrimans style of work, though Hearst personally championed the strip.{{sfn Sorel 1992 p=24}}  Following Herrimans death, the strip was discontinued, unlike most popular strips which were continued by other cartoonists after their creators deaths.  His stature was such that decades after his death, his work was displayed in art galleries.{{sfnm 1a1=Kramer 1y=1982 2a1=Boxer 2y=2006}}

Critics found Herrimans work difficult to classify and contextualize; Seldes, {{not a typo E.&nbsp;E. Cummings}}, and writers Adam Gopnik and Robert Warshow were among critics who tempered their enthusiasm for the strip with qualifications about its perceived naïveté and its "lowbrow" origins on the comic strip page.{{sfn Anderson 1999 pp=147–149}}

The strip has had a lasting influence on a large number of cartoonists. Mutts creator Patrick McDonnell calls Krazy Kat one of his foremost influences,{{sfn McDonnell 2007 p=6}} and is co-author of Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman (1986).{{sfn Heer 2010 p=10}}  Will Eisner{{sfn Lundy 2011}} discovered Herrimans comics when he was selling newspapers in the 1930s and called Krazy Kat "the big strong influence" on his own work.{{sfn Kaplan 2008 p=38}}  Art Spiegelman called Herriman one of his "conscious influences".{{sfn Jacobowitz 2007 p=154}}  Herrimans widespread influence on American {{not a typo underground comix}},{{sfn Estren 1974 pp=28, 30–31}} particularly his shape-shifting, Psychedelia psychedelic backgrounds, lack of respect for convention and his irreverence, is evident in the work of Robert Crumb,{{sfnm 1a1=Estren 1y=1974 1pp=30–31 2a1=Hignite 2y=2006 2p=20}} Denis Kitchen, and Bobby London.{{sfn Estren 1974 pp=28, 30–31}}  Journalist Paul Krassner called Crumb "the illegitimate offspring of Krazy Kat".{{sfn Estren 1974 p=30}} Cartoonist Chris Ware was so taken with Herrimans work he made a pilgrimage to Monument Valley to see the desert landscapes that inspired much of Herrimans art.{{sfn Heer 2010 p=3}}

Krazy Kat was a primary influence on other cartoonists such as Charles M.

Since 1997, the Small Press Expo has held the annual Ignatz Awards in honor of Herrimans mouse from Krazy Kat.  It recognizes talent in independent comics publishing.{{sfn Gabilliet Beaty Nguyen 2010 pp=253–245}}  Krazy Kat was ranked first on The Comics Journal{{}}s list of the greatest comics of the twentieth century.{{sfn Ito 2003 p=94}}  The Society of Illustrators inducted Herriman into its Hall of Fame in 2013.{{sfn Gardner 2013}}

==Work==

===Style===

Within the seeming strictures of the strip—the recurring characters, the Krazy–Ignatz–Offisa Pupp love triangle—Herriman improvised freely with the story, the shifting backgrounds, and the sex of the Krazy Kat{{}}s title character.{{sfn Anderson 1999 pp=147–148}}  Among the multicultural influences Herriman mixed in his work were those of the Navajo{{sfn Anderson 1999 p=147}} and Mexican.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 pp=78–79}}  He made creative use of language{{sfnm 1a1=Berger 1y=1996 1p=124 2a1=Estren 2y=1974 2p=112 3a1=Ito 3y=2003}} with a poetical sense,{{sfnm 1a1=Waugh 1y=1947 1p=57 2a1=Johnson 2y=1999 2p=208}} employing multilingual puns{{sfn Baetens 2012 p=109}} in a fanciful mix of dialects from different ethnic backgrounds.{{sfnm 1a1=Anderson 1y=1999 1p=159 2a1=McDonnell 2a2=OConnell 2a3=Havenon 2y=1986 2p=63}}  Herriman used metafictional techniques associated with postmodernism;{{sfn Soper 2008 p=83}} his characters were self-aware,{{sfn Johnson 1999 p=208}} he frequently drew attention to himself and his drawings as drawings in his strips, and he emphasized the subjectivity of language and experience.{{sfn Soper 2008 p=83}}

The cat, hands on its hips, says in dialect speech, "Oh, Im so gled, Mr. Stork, ysee Ignatz is such a skeptikle lil chep, he doubts me." ["Oh, Im so glad, Mr. Stork, you see Ignatz is such a skeptical little chap, he doubts me."]}}

Herriman drew with what cartoonist Edward Sorel called a "liberated, spontaneous-looking style&nbsp;...&nbsp;a cartoon counterpart of expressionism".{{sfn Sorel 1992 p=25}}  It was organic, and his pen strokes had a dynamic, thick-and-thin range which Sorel describes as instantly recognizable and difficult to imitate.  The Krazy Kat Sunday pages showed Herriman experimenting most freely—each had a unique panel layout and logo,{{sfn Sorel 1992 p=25}} and the jumbled panels could be circles, irregular shapes, or borderless.{{sfn Anderson 1999 p=152}}  In his last few years, Herrimans arthritis led to an ever-scratchier style of art; he used a knife to scratch out whites from inked surfaces, giving the artwork the look of a woodcut.{{sfn McDonnell OConnell Havenon 1986 p=85}}
