==Biography==
He began working at the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, in 1954, with a column dedicated to humor. Ziraldo gained national notoriety when working at the magazine O Cruzeiro in 1957 and subsequently at Jornal do Brasil in 1963. His characters (including Jeremias o Bom, the Supermãe and Mirinho) won readers.

In 1960, he launched the first Brazilian comic book made by a single author, Turma do Pererê, featuring the Saci (Brazilian folklore) Saci of Brazilian folklore, which was also the first comic book produced entirely in color in Brazil. Although it reached one of the largest runs of the season, Turma do Pererê was canceled in 1964, shortly after the start of the military regime in Brazil. In the 1970s, Editora Abril relaunched the magazine, this time, however, without the same success.<ref>[http://www.tecsi.fea.usp.br/eventos/Contecsi2004/BrasilEmFoco/ingles/comunica/quadrin/autilu/ziraldo/index.htm de Moya, Alvaro.
