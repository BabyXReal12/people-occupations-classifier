Eric Ernest Jolliffe (31 January 1907{{spaced ndash}}16 November 2001) was an Australian cartoonist and illustrator.

Born in Portsmouth, England, he was the youngest boy in a family of twelve children. The family migrated to Perth, Western Australia Perth in 1911 before settling in Sydney, New South Wales Sydney after six months, where they settled in Balmain, New South Wales Balmain. Eric left school at the age of fifteen, where he spent the next six years in the country New South Wales and Queensland, working as a boundary rider, rabbit Animal trapping trapper and in shearing sheds. A visit to Angus & Robertson bookstore, whilst visiting his family in Sydney, led to the discovery of a book on drawing. He afterwards reflected: I learned to my surprise that art wasnt necessarily a gift divine but a craft that could be studied and worked at.

Jolliffe enrolled in an introductory course at East Sydney Technical College (now the National Art School), where his teachers commented on his lack of talent. During the Great Depression depression he worked as a window cleaner, during which time he inundated The Bulletin with cartoons, which they subsequently rejected. Eventually they began to buy his cartoons and by the beginning of World War II he became a regular contributor, taking over Andy from Arthur Horner (cartoonist) Arthur Horner.  During the war he served as a camouflage officer with the RAAF and spent time in Arnhem Land.

After the war he joined Smiths Weekly but resigned and began freelancing selling his cartoon strips, Saltbush Bill and Witchettys Tribe to Pix Magazine.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.mickjoffe.com/Eric_Jolliffe title=Interview with Eric Jolliffe work=Mick Joffe Caricatures}}</ref> Another cartoon strip by him, Sandy Blight, appeared in Sydneys Sun-Herald. In 1973 Jolliffe began publishing his own magazine, Jolliffes Outback. He was particularly fond of "bush" subjects.

Jolliffe died at the age of 94 in the Central Coast, New South Wales on 16 November 2001.
