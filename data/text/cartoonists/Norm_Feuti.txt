{{Main article Retail (comic strip)}}
In Massachusetts, Feuti had over 15 years of Retailing retail management experience at seven different stores, selling everything from arts and crafts supplies, jewelry and mens footwear to clothing, giftware and toys. He first worked at a convenience store, recalling:

:They insisted we wear an apron. Our clientele was generally getting out of a bar late at night, coming in, yelling that we were out of their brand of cigarettes, and we still had to put on an apron to create an air of respectability.<ref name="NYT1">[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/31/business/media/31comic.html Barbaro, Michael. "Panel by Comic Panel, a Retail Clerk Exacts His Revenge". The New York Times, December 31, 2005.]</ref>

Next, he was employed at Father and Son Shoes, selling backpacks:
:As the company moved into the backpack business, it asked employees to wear a backpack around the store and compete to sell the highest number. Customers mocked him, the bag proved uncomfortable and, in the end, he said, the only contest winner was the stores manager, who received a color television. Soon, he switched to Bostonian, an upscale shoe store where the merchandise was more expensive and the customers complained more loudly. One shopper called the store to report that a shoelace had broken off. It was unclear how the lace had broken, or what it had to do with the store, but the man angrily demanded that Mr. Feuti mail him a new one, which he did. After that, Mr. Feuti worked at Learningsmith, an educational toy and gift store, where, he recalled, he encountered parents who thought that their children were little geniuses in the making. When Mr. Feuti steered one mother to a series of Looney Tunes-themed workbooks she sneered that her highly literate children "never watch television."<ref name="NYT1"/>

Tapping into such past experiences, Feutis daily comic strip Retail was launched on January 1, 2006 by King Features Syndicate.

In 2008, Feuti created a second strip, Gil, as a web comic on his website. The main character is an eight-year-old boy named Gil who is raised by his Single-parent single mother Cheryl in a poverty-stricken household. Gil also sees his father Frank occasionally, a neer-do-well who often offers Gil questionable advice. Secondary characters include Gils friend and confidant Shandra and his antagonist Morgan. In 2011, Gil was picked up for syndication by King Features and launched in newspapers on January 2, 2012.<ref>[http://www.talltaleradio.com/episode-128-norm-feuti-returns/ Racine, Tom.
