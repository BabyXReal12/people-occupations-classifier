Robert Kane, known professionally as Bob Kane (born Robert Kahn {{IPAc-en k ɑː n}}; October 24, 1915 – November 3, 1998), was an American comic book writer and artist who co-created, with Bill Finger, the DC Comics character Batman. He was inducted into the comic book industrys Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1994 and into the Eisner Award Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1996.

==Comics==
He entered the comics field two years later, in 1936, freelancing original material to editor Jerry Igers comic book Wow, What A Magazine!, including his first pencil and ink work on the serial Hiram Hick.<ref name="Joe Desris 1994 p. 223">{{cite book   first =Joe   last= Desris   chapter = Biography   title =Batman Archives, Volume 3   publisher = DC Comics   year= 1994  page= 223   isbn = 1-56389-099-2}}</ref> The following year, Kane began to work at Igers subsequent studio, Eisner & Iger, which was one of the first comic book "packagers" that produced comics on demand for publishers entering the new mass media medium during its late-1930s and 1940s Golden Age of Comic Books Golden Age. Among his work there was the funny animal feature "Peter Pupp" — which belied its look with overtones of "mystery and menace"<ref name="Joe Desris 1994 p. 223" /> — published in the U.K. comic magazine Wags and reprinted in Fiction Houses Jumbo Comics. Kane also produced work through Eisner & Iger for two of the companies that would later merge to form DC Comics, including the humor features "Ginger Snap" in More Fun Comics, "Oscar the Gumshoe" for Detective Comics, and "Professor Doolittle" for Adventure Comics. For that last title he went on to do his first adventure strip, "Rusty and his Pals".

===Batman===
File:Detective Comics 27.jpg thumb 180px Detective Comics #27 (May 1939). The first appearance of Batman. Art by Bob Kane.
In early 1939, DCs success with the seminal superhero Superman in Action Comics prompted editors to scramble for more such heroes. In response, Bob Kane conceived "Batman the Bat-Man."<ref>Les Daniels Daniels, Les. Batman: The Complete History. Chronicle Books, 1999. {{ISBN 0-8118-4232-0}}, pg. 18.</ref> Kane said his influences for the character included actor Douglas Fairbanks film portrayal of the swashbuckler Zorro; Leonardo da Vincis diagram of the ornithopter, a flying machine with huge bat-like wings; and the 1930 film The Bat (1926 film)#Remakes The Bat Whispers, based on Mary Rineharts mystery novel The Circular Staircase (1908).<ref>Daniels, page 20</ref>

Bill Finger joined Bob Kanes nascent studio in 1938. An aspiring writer and part-time shoe salesperson, he had met Kane at a party, and Kane later offered him a job ghost writer ghost writing the strips Rusty and Clip Carson.<ref>Walker, Brian. The Comics Since 1945 (Harry N. Abrams), pp. 10-12</ref><ref name="jim">Jim Steranko Steranko, Jim. The Steranko History of Comics (Supergraphics, Reading, Pa., 1970; {{ISBN 0-517-50188-0}}), p. 44</ref> He recalled that Kane
{{blockquote ...had an idea for a character called Batman, and hed like me to see the drawings. I went over to Kanes, and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with kind of ... reddish tights, I believe, with boots ... no gloves, no gauntlets ... with a small domino mask, swinging on a rope. He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings. And under it was a big sign ... BATMAN.<ref name="jim" />}}

Finger said he offered such suggestions as giving the character a cowl and scalloped cape instead of wings; adding gloves; leaving the masks eyeholes blank to connote mystery; and removing the bright red sections of the original costume, suggesting instead a gray-and-black color scheme. Finger additionally said<ref>Finger in Kane, Andrae, p. 41</ref> his suggestions were influenced by Lee Falks The Phantom, a Print syndication syndicated newspaper comic strip character with which Kane was familiar as well. Finger, who said he also devised the characters civilian name, Bruce Wayne, wrote the first Batman story, while Kane provided art.  Kane, who had already submitted the proposal for Batman at DC and held a contract, is the only person given an official company credit for Batmans creation. Comics historian Ron Goulart, in Comic Book Encyclopedia, refers to Batman as the "creation of artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger".<ref>Ron Goulart Goulart, Ron, Comic Book Encyclopedia (HarperCollins Harper Entertainment, New York, 2004) {{ISBN 0-06-053816-3}}.</ref>

According to Kane, "Bill Finger was a contributing force on Batman right from the beginning. He wrote most of the great stories and was influential in setting the style and genre other writers would emulate ... I made Batman a superhero-vigilante when I first created him. Bill turned him into a scientific detective.<ref>Kane, Andrae, p. 43</ref>

The character debuted in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939) and proved a breakout hit. Within a year, Kane hired art assistants Jerry Robinson (initially as an inker) and George Roussos (backgrounds artist and letterer). Though Robinson and Roussos worked out of Kanes art studio in The New York Times building, Kane himself did all his drawing at home.<ref>{{cite news   author = Gruenwald, Mark   authorlink = Mark Gruenwald   date = April 1983   title = George Roussos   work = Comics Interview   issue = 2   pages = 45–51   publisher = Fictioneer Books}}</ref> Shortly afterward, when DC wanted more Batman stories than Kanes studio could deliver, the company assigned Dick Sprang and other in-house pencilers as "ghostwriter ghost artists", drawing uncredited under Kanes supervision. Future Justice League writer Gardner Fox wrote some early scripts, including the two-part story "The Monk" that introduced some of The Batmans first "Bat-" equipment.<ref>Kane, Andrae, p. 103; Daniels, page 29</ref>

In 1943, Kane left the Batman comic books to focus on penciling the daily Batman newspaper comic strip.<ref name="Joe Desris 1994 p. 223"/> DC Comics artists ghosting the comic-book stories now included Jack Burnley and Win Mortimer, with Robinson moving up as penciler and Fred Ray contributing some covers. After the strip finished in 1946, Kane returned to the comic books but, unknown to DC, had hired his own personal ghosts, including Lew Schwartz<ref name=alterego51>Lew Schwartz interview, Alter Ego #51 (Aug. 2005)</ref> and Sheldon Moldoff from 1953-1967.<ref>Moldoff, in a 1994 interview given while Kane was alive<!--important to note, since claims made after another party is dead cannot be challenged and have less credibility than claims made while the other party is alive-->, described his clandestine arrangement in Alter Ego #59 (June 2006, p. 15)</ref>

===Robin===
Bill Finger recalled that,
{{quote Robin (character) Robin was an outgrowth of a conversation I had with Bob. As I said, Batman was a combination of [Douglas] Fairbanks and Sherlock Holmes. Holmes had his Watson. The thing that bothered me was that Batman didnt have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking. I found that as I went along Batman needed a Watson to talk to. Thats how Robin came to be. Bob called me over and said he was going to put a boy in the strip to identify with Batman. I thought it was a great idea.<ref name="jim" />}}

Kane, who had previously created a sidekick for Peter Pupp, proposed adding a boy named Mercury who would have worn a "super-costume".<ref>Comic Book Interview Super Special: Batman, Fictioneer Press, 1989</ref> Robinson suggested a normal human, along with the name "Robin (name) Robin", after Robin Hood books he had read during boyhood, and noting in a 2005 interview he had been inspired by one books N. C. Wyeth illustrations.<ref name="TCJ271">{{cite journal  last=Interview,  first= authorlink=  date=October 2005  title=Jerry Robinson  journal=The Comics Journal  volume=  issue=271  pages=  issn=0194-7869  url=http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=350&Itemid=48  accessdate= November 18, 2007  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522235616/http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=350&Itemid=48   archivedate=May 22, 2009}}</ref>
{{quote The impetus came from Bills wanting to extend the parameters of the story potential and of the drama. He saw that adding a sidekick would enhance the drama. Also, it enlarged the readership identification. The younger kids could then identify with Robin, which they couldnt with Batman, and the older ones with Batman. It extended the appeal on a lot of levels.<ref name="TCJ271" />}} The new character, an orphaned circus performer named Dick Grayson, came to live with Bruce Wayne as his young ward (law) ward in Detective Comics #38 (April 1940) and would inspire many similar sidekicks throughout the Golden Age of comic books.

===The Joker===
Batmans nemesis the Joker (comics) Joker was introduced near that same time, in Batman #1 (Spring 1940). Credit for that characters creation is disputed. Kanes position is that

{{quote Bill Finger and I created the Joker. Bill was the writer. Jerry Robinson came to me with a playing card of the Joker. Thats the way I sum it up. [The Joker] looks like Conrad Veidt — you know, the actor in The Man Who Laughs (1928 film) The Man Who Laughs, [the 1928 movie based on the novel] by Victor Hugo. ... Bill Finger had a book with a photograph of Conrad Veidt and showed it to me and said, Heres the Joker. Jerry Robinson had absolutely nothing to do with it. But hell always say he created it till he dies. He brought in a playing card, which we used for a couple of issues for him [the Joker] to use as his playing card.<ref>{{cite web   url = http://franklovece.com/webexclusives.html  title= Web Exclusives — Bob Kane interview  publisher=FrankLovece.com (official site of Entertainment Weekly writer)   date = 17 May 1994  accessdate=2010-12-29   archivedate = 4 February 2012   archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204122050/http://franklovece.com/webexclusives.html}}</ref>}}

Robinson, whose original Joker playing card was on public display in the exhibition "Masters of American Comics" at the Jewish Museum (New York) Jewish Museum in New York City, New York, from September 16, 2006 to January 28, 2007, and the William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum in Atlanta, Georgia (U.S. state) Georgia from October 24, 2004 to August 28, 2005, has countered that:

{{quote Bill Finger knew of Conrad Veidt because Bill had been to a lot of the foreign films. Veidt ... had this clown makeup with the frozen smile on his face (classic). When Bill saw the first drawing of the Joker, he said, That reminds me of Conrad Veidt in The Man Who Laughs. He said he would bring in some shots of that movie to show me. Thats how that came about. I think in Bills mind, he fleshed out the concept of the character.<ref>{{cite web author=  url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=88092  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502003113/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=88092  archivedate=May 2, 2009  publisher = Newsarama.com  date= October 18, 2006  title= The Joker, the Jewish Museum and Jerry: Talking to Jerry Robinson  first=Matt last=Brady accessdate=December 29, 2010}}</ref>}}

Robinson added, however, "If you read the Batman historian E. Nelson Bridwell [E. Nelson] Bridwell, he had one interview where he interviewed Bill Finger and he said no, the Joker was created by me — an acknowledgement. He can be credited and Bob himself, we all played a role in it. ... .He wrote the script of that, so he really was co-creator, and Bob and I did the visuals, so Bob was also."<ref>Jerry Robinson in {{cite web url=http://www.rocketllama.com/blog-it/2009/08/05/interview-the-jokers-maker-tackles-the-man-who-laughs   title=The Jokers Maker Tackles The Man Who Laughs publisher=RocketLlama.com  date=August 5, 2009   accessdate = December 29, 2010  archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150910064541/http://www.rocketllama.com/blog-it/2009/08/05/interview-the-jokers-maker-tackles-the-man-who-laughs/   archivedate=September 10, 2015 deadurl=no}}</ref>

Finger, however, claimed that he created the villain as a caricature of the aristocratic type, because "stuffy English gentlemen" reminded him of emperor penguins.<ref name="Daniels, Les 1999, p. 42"/>
