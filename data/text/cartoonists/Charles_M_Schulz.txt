Schulz loved drawing and sometimes drew his family dog, Spike, who ate unusual things, such as pins and tacks. In 1937, Schulz drew a picture of Spike and sent it to Ripleys Believe It or Not!; his drawing appeared in Robert Ripleys syndicated panel, captioned, "A hunting dog that eats pins, tacks, and razor blades is owned by C. F. Schulz, St. Paul, Minn." and "Drawn by Sparky"<ref>{{cite book  author=Mendelson, Lee  title=Charlie Brown & Charlie Schulz  year=1970  publisher=The World Publishing Company}}</ref> (C.F. was his father, Carl Fred Schulz).<ref name="mich1">{{harvnb Michaelis 2007 p=9}}</ref>

Schulz attended Richards Gordon Elementary School in Saint Paul, where he skipped two half-grades. He became a shy, timid teenager, perhaps as a result of being the youngest in his class at Central High School (Saint Paul, Minnesota) Central High School. One well-known episode in his high school life was the rejection of his drawings by his high school yearbook, which he referred to in Peanuts years later, when he had Lucy ask Charlie Brown to sign a picture he drew of a horse, only to then say it was a prank.<ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite news  url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/11/peanuts-matt-groening-jonathan-franzen   work=The Guardian  place=London   title=Oh boy, Charlie Brown   date=October 11, 2008   accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref> A five-foot-tall statue of Snoopy was placed in the schools main office 60 years later.<ref>{{cite web title=Peanuts on Parade url=https://www.johnweeks.com/tour/peanuts/snoopy.html publisher=John Weeks accessdate=November 20, 2017}}</ref>

==Military service and post-war postions==
In February 1943, Schulzs mother Dena died after a long illness. At the time of her death, he had only recently been made aware that she suffered from cancer. Schulz had by all accounts been very close to his mother and her death had a big effect on him.<ref>{{cite web title=PBS Special: Good Ol Charles Schulz url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/charles-schulz/good-ol-charles-schulz/86/ publisher=PBS American Masters accessdate=October 29, 2007}}</ref>

Around the same time, Schulz was Conscription drafted into the United States Army. He served as a staff sergeant with the 20th Armored Division (United States) 20th Armored Division in Europe during World War II, as a squad leader on a M2 Browning .50 caliber machine gun team. His unit saw combat only at the very end of the war. Schulz said he had one opportunity to fire his machine gun but forgot to load it. Fortunately, he said, the German soldier he could have fired at willingly surrendered. Years later, Schulz proudly spoke of his wartime service.<ref name="mich3">{{harvnb Michaelis 2007 pp=150–151}}</ref>

In late 1945, Schulz returned to Minneapolis. He did lettering for a Roman Catholic comic magazine, Timeless Topix, and then, in July 1946, took a job at Art Instruction Schools Art Instruction, Inc., reviewing and grading lessons submitted by students.<ref name=Michaelis/>{{rp 164}} Schulz had taken a Distance education correspondence course from the school before he was drafted. He worked at the school for several years while developing his career as a comic creator until he was making enough money to do that full-time.

==Career==
Schulzs first group of regular cartoons, a weekly series of one-panel jokes called Lil Folks, was published from June 1947 to January 1950 in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, with Schulz usually doing four one-panel drawings per issue. It was in Lil Folks that Schulz first used the name Charlie Brown for a character, although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys as well as one buried in sand. The series also had a dog that looked much like Snoopy. In May 1948, Schulz sold his first one-panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post; within the next two years, a total of 17 untitled drawings by Schulz were published in the Post,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.airplanesandrockets.com/magazines/charles-schulz-saturday-evening-post.htm title=Saturday Evening Post "Lil Folks" Comics by Charles Schulz author=Kirt Blattenberger Airplanes and Rockets publisher=}}</ref> simultaneously with his work for the Pioneer Press. Around the same time, he tried to have Lil Folks syndicated through the Newspaper Enterprise Association; Schulz would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but the deal fell through. Lil Folks was dropped from the Pioneer Press in January 1950.

Later that year, Schulz approached United Feature Syndicate with the one-panel series Lil Folks, and the syndicate became interested. By that time Schulz had also developed a comic strip, usually using four panels rather than one, and to Schulzs delight, the syndicate preferred that version. Peanuts made its first appearance on October 2, 1950, in seven newspapers. The weekly Sunday page debuted on January 6, 1952. After a slow start, Peanuts eventually became one of the most popular comic strips of all time, as well as one of the most influential. Schulz also had a short-lived sports-oriented comic strip, Its Only a Game (1957–59), but he abandoned it after the success of Peanuts. From 1956 to 1965 he contributed a single-panel strip, "Young Pillars", featuring teenagers, to Youth, a publication associated with the Church of God (Anderson) Church of God.

In 1957 and 1961 he illustrated two volumes of Art Linkletters Kids Say the Darndest Things,<ref>{{cite web title=Kids say the darndest things! url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/kids-say-the-darndest-things/oclc/336428 publisher=Worldcat accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web title=Kids still say the darndest things! url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/kids-still-say-the-darndest-things/oclc/11396008?tab=details publisher=Worldcat accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> and in 1964 a collection of letters, Dear President Johnson, by Bill Adler.<ref>{{cite web title=Dear President Johnson url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/dear-president-johnson/oclc/1383960 publisher=Worldcat accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>

=== Peanuts ===
{{Main Peanuts}}
At its height, Peanuts was published daily in 2,600 papers in 75 countries, in 21 languages. Over the nearly 50 years that Peanuts was published, Schulz drew nearly 18,000 strips. The strips, plus merchandise and product endorsements, produced revenues of more than $1 billion per year, with Schulz earning an estimated $30 million to $40 million annually.<ref name="NYTobit"/> During the strips run, Schulz took only one vacation, a five-week break in late 1997 to celebrate his 75th birthday; reruns of the strip ran during his vacation, the only time that occurred during Schulzs life.

The first collection of Peanuts strips was published in July 1952 by Rinehart & Company. Many more books followed, greatly contributing to the strips increasing popularity. In 2004, Fantagraphics began their Complete Peanuts series. Peanuts also proved popular in other media; the first animated TV special, A Charlie Brown Christmas, aired in December 1965 and won an Emmy award. Numerous TV specials followed, the latest being Happiness is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown in 2011. Until his death, Schulz wrote or co-wrote the TV specials and carefully oversaw their production.

Charlie Brown, the principal character of Peanuts, was named after a co-worker at Art Instruction Inc. Schulz drew much from his own life, some examples being:
* Like Charlie Browns parents, Schulzs father was a barber and his mother a housewife.
* Like Charlie Brown, Schulz had often felt shy and withdrawn. In an interview with Charlie Rose in May 1997, Schulz observed, "I suppose there’s a melancholy feeling in a lot of cartoonists, because cartooning, like all other humor, comes from bad things happening."<ref>Kleon, Austin (October 17, 2007). [http://austinkleon.com/2007/10/17/charles-schultz-on-charlie-rose/ "CHARLES SCHULZ ON CHARLIE ROSE"]. austinkleon.com.</ref>
* Schulz reportedly had an intelligent dog when he was a boy. Although this dog was a Pointer (dog breed) pointer, not a beagle like Snoopy, family photos confirm a certain physical resemblance.
* References to Snoopys brother Spike (Peanuts) Spike living outside of Needles, California, were influenced by the few years (1928–30) the Schulz family lived there; they moved to Needles to join other family members who had relocated from Minnesota to tend to an ill cousin.<ref name="Needles">{{cite book  author=Johnson, Rheta Grimsley  title=Good Grief: The Story of Charles M. Schulz  pages=30–36  year=1989  publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing  isbn=0-8362-8097-0}}</ref>
* Schulzs inspiration for Charlie Browns unrequited love for the Little Red-Haired Girl was Little Red-Haired Girl#Inspiration Donna Mae Johnson, an Art Instruction Inc. accountant with whom he fell in love. When Schulz finally proposed to her in June 1950, shortly after he had made his first contract with his syndicate, she turned him down and married another man.
* Linus van Pelt Linus and Shermy (Peanuts) Shermy were named for his good friends Linus Maurer and Sherman Plepler, respectively.<ref name=sitribune>{{cite news first=Carole last=Kelleher  title=Linus Maurer, 1926-2016   url=http://www.sonomanews.com/news/5179817-181/linus-maurer-1926-2016?artslide=0  work=Sonoma Index-Tribune  date=February 4, 2016  accessdate=February 14, 2016}}</ref>
* Peppermint Patty was inspired by Patricia Swanson, one of his cousins on his mothers side. Schulz devised the characters name when he saw peppermint candies in his house.<ref name="mich">{{harvnb Michaelis 2007 p=335}}</ref><ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-03-26/entertainment/0003270180_1_lucy-van-pelt-charles-schulz-peppermint-patty "Charlie Brown was the name of one of..." Chicago Tribune, March 26, 2000.]</ref>

===Influences===
The Charles M. Schulz Museum counts Milton Caniff (Terry and the Pirates (comic strip) Terry and the Pirates) and Bill Mauldin as key influences on Schulzs work. In his own strip, Schulz regularly described Snoopys annual Veterans Day (United States) Veterans Day visits with Mauldin, including mention of Mauldins World War II cartoons.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://comics.com/peanuts/  title=Peanuts by Schulz  publisher=Comics.com  quote=November 11th strips from 1969–70, 76, 79–81, 83, 85–89, 91–93, 96–99}}</ref> Schulz (and critics) also credited George Herriman (Krazy Kat), Roy Crane (Wash Tubbs), Elzie C. Segar (Thimble Theatre) and Percy Crosby (Skippy (comic strip) Skippy) as influences. In a 1994 address to fellow cartoonists, Schulz discussed several of them.<ref>{{cite web url=http://cartoonician.com/charles-m-schulz-on-cartooning/ title=Charles M. Schulz on Cartooning work=Hogans Alley accessdate=June 19, 2015}}</ref> But according to his biographer Rheta Grimsley Johnson:

{{quote It would be impossible to narrow down three or two or even one direct influence on [Schulzs] personal drawing style. The uniqueness of "Peanuts" has set it apart for years... That one-of-a-kind quality permeates every aspect of the strip and very clearly extends to the drawing. It is purely his with no clear forerunners and no subsequent pretenders.<ref>Johnson (1989), p. 68.</ref>}}

According to the Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center, Schulz watched the movie Citizen Kane 40 times. The character Lucy van Pelt also expresses a fondness for the film, and in one strip she cruelly spoils the ending for her younger brother.<ref>{{cite web url=http://voices.yahoo.com/the-pbs-series-american-masters-good-ol-charles-schulz-634714.html title=Yahoo work=Yahoo accessdate=June 19, 2015 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729001417/http://voices.yahoo.com/the-pbs-series-american-masters-good-ol-charles-schulz-634714.html archivedate=July 29, 2014 df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In April 1951, Schulz married Joyce Halverson (no relation to Schulzs mother Dena Halverson Schulz)<ref>{{Cite journal  title=Schulz & Peanuts Time Line  url=http://www.schulzmuseum.org/timeline.html  publisher=Charles M. Schulz Museum  accessdate=January 16, 2009  ref=harv  postscript=<!--None-->  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121173110/http://www.schulzmuseum.org/timeline.html  archivedate=January 21, 2009  df=mdy-all }}</ref>, and Schulz adopted Halversons daughter, Meredith Hodges Meredith. Later the same year, they moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado. Their son, Monte, was born in February 1952, and three more children were born later, in Minnesota.<ref>{{cite book  last=Inge  first=M.

Schulz and his family returned to Minneapolis and stayed until 1958. They then moved to Sebastopol, California, where Schulz built his first studio. (Until then, hed worked at home or in a small rented office room.) It was there that Schulz was interviewed for the unaired television documentary A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1963 film) A Boy Named Charlie Brown. Some of the footage was eventually used in a later documentary, Charlie Brown and Charles Schulz.<ref>{{cite book title=Charlie Brown and Charles Schulz edition=The original documentary on DVD  publisher= Charles M. Schulz Museum}}</ref> Schulzs father died while visiting him in 1966, the same year Schulzs Sebastopol studio burned down. By 1969, Schulz had moved to Santa Rosa, California, where he lived and worked until his death. While briefly living in Colorado Springs, Schulz painted a mural on the bedroom wall of his daughter Meredith, featuring Patty with a balloon, Charlie Brown jumping over a candlestick, and Snoopy playing on all fours. The wall was removed in 2001, donated and relocated to the Charles M. Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa.

By Thanksgiving 1970, it was clear that Schulzs marriage was in trouble.<ref name="PBS">{{Cite episode title=Good Ol Charles Schulz url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/charles-schulz/good-ol-charles-schulz/86/ series=American Masters network=Public Broadcasting Service PBS season= airdate=October 29, 2007}}</ref> He was having an affair with a 25-year-old woman named Tracey Claudius.<ref>{{cite web   title=I only dread one day at a time!   author=Miller, Laura   work=Salon   url=http://www.salon.com/2007/10/13/charles_schulz/   date=October 8, 2007   accessdate=May 6, 2009 }}</ref> The Schulzes divorced in 1972, and in September 1973 he married Jean Forsyth Clyde, whom he had first met when she brought her daughter to his hockey rink.<ref name="PBS"/> They were married for 27 years, until Schulzs death in 2000.

===Kidnapping attempt===
On Sunday, May 8, 1988, two gunmen in ski masks entered the Schulzes home through an unlocked door, planning to kidnap Jean, but the attempt failed when their daughter Jill drove up to the house, prompting the would-be kidnappers to flee. Jill called the police from a neighbors house. Sonoma County Sheriff Dick Michaelsen said, "It was obviously an attempted kidnap-ransom. This was a targeted criminal act. They knew exactly who the victims were." Neither Schulz nor his wife was hurt during the incident.<ref>{{cite news url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&s_site=mercurynews&p_multi=SJ&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB72DB00CB05CFA&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM  title=Cartoonists Home Invaded in Apparent Kidnap Attempt work=San Jose Mercury News date= May 13, 1988}}</ref><ref>{{cite news url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eXsUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7wIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3975,2195263&dq=kidnap+charles-schulz&hl=en  title=Good grief, its a kidnap attempt work=Toledo Blade date= May 13, 1988}}</ref>

===Sports===

Schulz had a long association with ice sports, and both figure skating and ice hockey featured prominently in his cartoons. In Santa Rosa, he owned the Redwood Empire Ice Arena, which opened in 1969 and featured a snack bar called "The Warm Puppy".<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/> Schulzs daughter Amy served as a model for the figure skating in the television special Shes a Good Skate, Charlie Brown (1980). Schulz also was very active in senior ice-hockey tournaments; in 1975, he formed Snoopys Senior World Hockey Tournament at his Redwood Empire Ice Arena, and in 1981, he was awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy for outstanding service to the sport of hockey in the United States.<ref>"[https://www.hhof.com/htmlsilverware/silver_splashlesterpatrick.shtml Legends of Hockey - Non-NHL Trophies - Lester Patrick Trophy]," Hockey Hall of Fame (accessed June 2, 2016)</ref> Schulz also enjoyed golf and was a member of the Santa Rosa Golf and Country Club from 1959 to 2000.

In 1998, Schulz hosted the first Over 75 Hockey Tournament. In 2000, the Ramsey County Board voted to rename the Highland Park Ice Arena the Charles M. Schulz-Highland Arena in his honor.

===Art===
In addition to comics, Schulz was interested in art in general; his favorite artist in his later years was Andrew Wyeth.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/books/review/McGrath-t.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0  work=The New York Times title=Review of Schulz and Peanuts}}</ref> As a young adult, Schulz also developed a passion for classical music. Although the character Schroeder in Peanuts adored Ludwig van Beethoven Beethoven, Schulzs personal favorite composer was reportedly Johannes Brahms Brahms.<ref>{{cite news work=The New York Times url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1126.html title=On This Day}}</ref>

===Declining health and retirement===
File:Charles Schulz crop 1993.jpg thumb left upright Schulz in 1993
In July 1981, Schulz underwent heart bypass surgery. During his hospital stay, President Ronald Reagan phoned to wish him a quick recovery.

In the 1980s, Schulz complained that "sometimes my hand shakes so much I have to hold my wrist to draw." This led to an erroneous impression that Schulz had Parkinsons disease. According to a letter from his physician, placed in the Archives of the Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center Charles M. Schulz Museum by his widow, Schulz had essential tremor, a condition alleviated by beta blockers. Schulz still insisted on writing and drawing the strip by himself, resulting in shakier lines over time.

In November 1999, Schulz suffered several small strokes and a blocked aorta, and he was later found to have colorectal cancer colon cancer that had metastasis metastasized. Because of the chemotherapy and the fact that he could not see clearly, he announced his retirement on December 14, 1999. This was difficult for Schulz, who told Al Roker on Today (NBC program) The Today Show, "I never dreamed that this was what would happen to me. I always had the feeling that I would probably stay with the strip until I was in my early eighties. But all of a sudden its gone. Its been taken away from me. I did not take this away from me."<ref name=Michaelis>{{cite book last=Michaelis first=David title=Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography year=2008 publisher=Harper Collins isbn=9780060937997 url=https://books.google.com/books?id=omiHL5hnqLcC&lpg=PA561 page=561}}</ref>

Schulz was asked if, in his final Peanuts strip, Charlie Brown would finally get to kick the football after so many decades (one of the many recurring themes in Peanuts was Charlie Browns attempts to kick a football while Lucy was holding it, only to have Lucy pull it back at the last moment, causing him to fall on his back). His response, "Oh, no. Definitely not. I couldnt have Charlie Brown kick that football; that would be a terrible disservice to him after nearly half a century." But in a December 1999 interview, holding back tears, Schulz recounted the moment when he signed his final strip, saying, “All of a sudden I thought, You know, that poor, poor kid, he never even got to kick the football. What a dirty trick—he never had a chance to kick the football.”<ref name="PBS"/><ref>{{cite interview  last=Schulz  first=Charles  interviewer=Al Roker title=Interview with Al Roker date=December 1999  accessdate=}}</ref>

===Death===
Schulz died in his sleep at home on February 12, 2000, at around 9:45 pm, of colon cancer. The last original Peanuts strip was published the next day, Sunday, February 13. Schulz had predicted that the strip would outlive him because the strips were usually drawn weeks before their publication. Schulz was buried at Pleasant Hills Cemetery in Sebastopol, California.<ref>Boxer, Sarah (February 14, 2000). [https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1126.html "Charles M. Schulz, Peanuts Creator, Dies at 77"]. The New York Times.</ref>

As part of his contract with the syndicate, Schulz requested that no other artist be allowed to draw Peanuts. United Features had legal ownership of the strip, but honored his wishes, instead print syndication syndicating reruns to newspapers. New television specials have also been produced since Schulzs death, with the stories based on previous strips; Schulz always said the TV shows were entirely separate from the strip.

Schulz was honored on May 27, 2000, by cartoonists of more than 100 comic strips, who paid homage to him and Peanuts by incorporating his characters into their strips that day.<ref>[http://fivecentsplease.org/dpb/peantfaq.txt Peanuts Faq, section 3.6], Derrick Bang</ref><ref>{{cite web  url = http://www.chivian.com/chivian/PeanutsTribute.html  title = Cartoonists pay tribute to Charles M.

A proponent of manned space flight, Schulz was honored with the naming of Apollo 10 command module Charlie Brown, and lunar module Snoopy#In aviation and space Snoopy launched on May 18, 1969.  The Silver Snoopy award is a special honor awarded to NASA employees and contractors for outstanding achievements related to human flight safety or mission success. The award certificate states that it is "In Appreciation" "For professionalism, dedication and outstanding support that greatly enhanced space flight safety and mission success."

On January 1, 1974, Schulz served as the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade Rose Parade in Pasadena, California.

Schulz was a keen contract bridge bridge player, and Peanuts occasionally included bridge references.

==Biographies==
Multiple biographies have been written about Schulz, including Rheta Grimsley Johnsons Good Grief: The Story of Charles M. Schulz (1989), which Schulz authorized.

The lengthiest biography, Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography (2007) by David Michaelis, has been heavily criticized by the Schulz family; Schulzs son Monte stated it has "a number of factual errors throughout&nbsp;... [including] factual errors of interpretation" and extensively documents these errors in a number of essays. However, Michaelis maintains that there is "no question" his work is accurate.<ref>{{cite news last=Schulz first =Monte title=Regarding Schulz and Peanuts newspaper=The Comics Journal  issue =290   pages=27–78  date=May 2008 issn=0194-7869 ref =harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite news url=http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=837&Itemid=48 title=The Comics Journal&nbsp;— The Schulz and Peanuts Roundtable (excerpts from TCJ #290) last=Schulz first=Monte author2=Gary Groth date=May 18, 2008 newspaper=The Comics Journal publisher=Fantagraphics accessdate=July 28, 2008 archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ZeWATO6I?url=http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=837&Itemid=48 archivedate=July 28, 2008 deadurl=yes df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news last=Cohen  first=Patricia  title=Biography of ‘Peanuts’ Creator Stirs Family  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/08/books/08schu.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin  accessdate=October 8, 2007 newspaper=The New York Times  date=October 8, 2007 ref=harv  postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Although cartoonist Bill Watterson (creator of Calvin and Hobbes) feels the biography does justice to Schulzs legacy, while giving insight into the emotional impetus of the creation of the strips, cartoonist and critic R.C.

Shanahan cites, in particular, such things as Michaelis crude characterizations of Schulzs mothers family, and "an almost voyeuristic quality" to the hundred pages devoted to the breakup of Schulzs first marriage.

In light of Michaelis biography and the controversy surrounding his interpretation of the personality who was Charles Schulz, responses from Schulzs family reveal some intimate knowledge about the Schulzs persona beyond that of mere artist.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/books/more-on-the-schulz-book#comment-34417  title=Cartoon Brew: Leading the Animation Conversation " More on the Schulz Book  last=Amidi  first=Amid  date=October 13, 2007  work=Cartoon Brew  accessdate=July 28, 2008  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915100932/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/books/more-on-the-schulz-book#comment-34417  archivedate=September 15, 2008  df=mdy }}  on July 28, 2008.</ref>

==Legacy==<!-- This section is linked from Peanuts -->
On July 1, 1983, Camp Snoopy opened at Knotts Berry Farm, a forested, mountain theme area featuring the Peanuts characters. It has rides designed for younger children and is one of the most popular areas of the amusement park.<ref>{{cite book author1=Merritt, Christopher   author2=Lynxwiler, J.

When the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota opened in 1992, the amusement park in the center of the mall was themed around Schulzs Peanuts characters, until the mall lost the rights to use the brand in 2006.{{citation needed date=October 2017}}

The Jean and Charles Schulz Information Center at Sonoma State University opened in 2000 and now stands as one of the largest buildings in the CSU system and the State of California, with a 400,000-volume general collection and with a 750,000-volume automated retrieval system capacity. The $41.5 million building was named after Schulz and his wife donated $5 million needed to build and furnish the structure.

In 2000, the Sonoma County, California Sonoma County Board of Supervisors renamed the county airport as the Charles M. Schulz - Sonoma County Airport in the cartoonists honor. The airports logo features Snoopy in goggles and scarf, taking to the skies on top of his red doghouse.

Peanuts on Parade has been St. Paul, Minnesota’s tribute to its favorite native cartoonist. It began in 2000 with the placing of 101 {{convert 5 ft m adj=mid -tall}} statues of Snoopy throughout the city of St. Paul. Every summer for the following four years, statues of a different Peanuts character were placed on the sidewalks of St. Paul. In 2001, there was Charlie Brown Around Town, 2002 brought Looking for Lucy, in 2003 along came Linus Blankets St. Paul, ending in 2004 with Snoopy lying on his doghouse. The statues were auctioned off at the end of each summer, so some remain around the city, but others have been relocated. The auction proceeds were used for artists scholarships and for permanent, bronze statues of the Peanuts characters. These bronze statues are in Landmark Plaza and Rice Park in downtown St. Paul.

The Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center in Santa Rosa opened on August 17, 2002, two blocks away from his former studio, celebrating his lifes work and the art of cartooning. A bronze statue of Charlie Brown and Snoopy stands in Depot Park in downtown Santa Rosa.

Santa Rosa, California, celebrated the 60th anniversary of the strip in 2005 by continuing the Peanuts on Parade tradition beginning with Its Your Town Charlie Brown (2005), Summer of Woodstock (2006), Snoopys Joe Cool Summer (2007), and Look Out For Lucy (2008).

Calvin and Hobbes creator Bill Watterson wrote in 2007: "Peanuts pretty much defines the modern comic strip, so even now its hard to see it with fresh eyes. The clean, minimalist drawings, the sarcastic humor, the unflinching emotional honesty, the inner thoughts of a household pet, the serious treatment of children, the wild fantasies, the merchandising on an enormous scale—in countless ways, Schulz blazed the wide trail that most every cartoonist since has tried to follow."<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119214690326956694 title=The Grief That Made Peanuts Good author=Bill Watterson date=October 13, 2007 work=WSJ accessdate=June 19, 2015}}</ref>

==Religion==
According to a 2015 "spiritual biography," Schulzs faith was complex and personal.<ref name="auto">Lind, Stephen J. (2015) A Charlie Brown Religion (Jackson: U P Mississippi)</ref>  He often touched on religious themes in his work, including the classic television cartoon, A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965), which features the character Linus van Pelt quoting the King James Version of the Bible {{bibleref2 Luke 2:8–14 KJV Luke 2:8–14}} to explain "what Christmas is all about." In interviews Schulz said that Linus represented his spiritual side, and the spiritual biography points out a much wider array of religious references.<ref name="auto"/>

Reared in a nominally Lutheran family, Schulz had been active in the Church of God (Anderson, Indiana) as a young adult and later taught Sunday school at a United Methodist Church.<ref name="auto"/> In the 1960s, Robert L. Short interpreted certain themes and conversations in Peanuts as consistent with parts of Christian theology, and used them as illustrations in his lectures on the Gospel, as explained in his book The Gospel According to Peanuts, the first of several he wrote on religion, Peanuts, and other popular culture.

From the late 1980s, Schulz said in interviews that some people had described him as a "secular humanism secular humanist" though he didnt know one way or another:<ref>Templeton, David. [http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/12.30.99/schulz2-9952.html My Lunch with Sparky], reproduced from the December 30, 1999 – January 5, 2000 issue of the Sonoma County Independent.

{{quote I do not go to church anymore... I guess you might say Ive come around to secular humanism, an obligation I believe all humans have to others and the world we live in.<ref>Johnson (1989), p. 137.</ref>}}

In 2013, Schulzs widow said:

{{quote I think that he was a deeply thoughtful and spiritual man. Sparky was not the sort of person who would say "oh thats Gods will" or "God will take care of it." I think to him that was an easy statement, and he thought that God was much more complicated.

When he came back from the army he was very lonely. His mother had died and he was invited to church by a pastor who had prepared his mothers service from the Church of God. Sparkys father was worried about him and was talking to the pastor and so the pastor invited Sparky to come to church. So Sparky went to church, joined the youth group and for a good 4–5 years he went to Bible study and went to church 3 times a week (2 Bible studies, 1 service). He said he had read the Bible through three times and taught Sunday school. He was always looking for what those passages REALLY Might have meant. Some of his discussions with priests and ministers were so interesting because he wanted to find out what these people (who he thought were more educated than he) thought.

When he taught Sunday school, he would never tell people what to believe. God was very important to him, but in a very deep way, in a very mysterious way.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1snoy1/im_jean_schulz_my_husband_drew_the_peanuts_comic/ title=Im Jean Schulz.
