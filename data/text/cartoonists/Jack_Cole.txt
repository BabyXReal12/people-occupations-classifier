==Biography==

===Early life and career===
File:PoliceComics24.jpg thumb Police Comics No. 24 (Nov. 1943). Cover art by Jack Cole
Born in New Castle, Pennsylvania New Castle, Pennsylvania,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.lawrencecountymemoirs.com/lcmpages/811/artist-cartoonist-jack-cole-new-castle-pa title=Lawrence County Memoirs: Artist/Cartoonist Jack Cole - New Castle PA website=www.lawrencecountymemoirs.com}}</ref> Cole—the third of six children of a dry goods-store owner and amateur-entertainer father and a former elementary school-teacher mother—was untrained in art except for the Landon School of Illustration and Cartooning correspondence course. At age 17, he bicycled solo cross-country to Los Angeles, California and back. Cole recounted this adventure in an early self-illustrated professional sale "A Boy and His Bike" (which has often been cited as appearing in Boys Life magazine, but in fact the source of this article is unknown, but speculated to have likely appeared in Coles hometown newspaper). Back home, Cole took a job at American Can and continued to draw at night.

In 1936, having married childhood sweetheart Dorothy Mahoney soon after graduating High school (North America) high school, Cole moved with his wife to New York Citys Greenwich Village. After spending a year attempting to break in as a magazine/newspaper illustrator, Cole began drawing for the studio of the Harry "A" Chesler, one of the first comic-book "packagers" who supplied outsourced stories to publishers entering the new medium. There, Cole drew such features as "TNT Todd of the FBI" and "Little Dynamite" for Centaur Publications comics such as Funny Pages and Keen Detective Funnies. He produced such additional features as "King Koles Kourt" (under the pseudonym Geo. Nagle), "Officer Clancy", and "Peewee Throttle" (under the pseudonym Ralph Johns), and "Ima Slooth."

===Golden Age of Comic Books===
{{refimprove section, except for one footnote, date= April 2014}}
Lev Gleason Publications hired Cole in 1939 to edit Silver Streak Comics, where one of his first tasks was to revamp the newly created superhero Daredevil (Golden Age) Daredevil. Other characters created or worked on by the prolific tyro include Archie Comics MLJs The Comet in Pep Comics—who in short order became the first superhero to be killed—and his replacement, the Hangman.

After becoming an editor at Lev Gleason and revamping Jack Binder (comics) Jack Binders original Golden Age of comic books Golden Age Daredevil (Golden Age) Daredevil in 1940, Cole was hired at Quality Comics. He worked with Will Eisner, assisting on the writer-artists signature hero The Spirit—a masked crime-fighter created for a weekly syndicated newspaper Sunday supplement and reprinted in Quality Comics. At the behest of Quality publisher Everett "Busy" Arnold, Cole later created his own satiric, Spirit-style hero, Midnight (DC Comics) Midnight, for Smash Comics No. 18 (Jan. 1941). Midnight, the alter ego of radio announcer Dave Clark, wore a similar Fedora (hat) fedora hat and domino mask, and partnered with a talking monkey—questionably in place of the Spirits young African-American sidekick, Ebony White.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.toonopedia.com/midnight.htm title=Don Marksteins Toonopedia: Midnight first=Donald D. last=Markstein website=www.toonopedia.com}}</ref> During Eisners World War II military service, Cole and Lou Fine were the primary Spirit ghost artists; their stories were reprinted in DC Comics hardcover collections The Spirit Archives Vols. 5 to 9 (2001–2003), spanning July 1942&nbsp;– Dec. 1944. In addition, Cole continued to draw one and two-page filler pieces, sometimes under the pseudonym Ralph Johns, and a memorable autobiographical appearance in "Inki," which appeared in Crack Comics #34.<ref>Crack Comics No. 34 (Quality Comics, Autumn 1944).</ref>

===Plastic Man===
{{main article Plastic Man}}
File:JackColeMagArt01.jpg thumb left 190px Sample of Coles original art for Humorama
Cole created Plastic Man for a backup feature in Qualitys Police Comics #1 (Aug. 1941). While Timely Comics quickly forgotten Flexo the Rubber Man had preceded "Plas" as comics first stretching hero, Coles character became an immediate hit, and Police Comics{{}} lead feature with issue #5. As well, Coles offbeat humor, combined with Plastic Mans ability to take any shape, gave the cartoonist opportunities to experiment with text and graphics in groundbreaking manner—helping to define the mediums visual vocabulary{{citation needed date=August 2015}}, and making the idiosyncratic character one of the few to endure from the Golden Age to modern times. Plastic Man gained his own title in 1943.

By the decades end, however, Coles feature was being created entirely by anonymous ghost writers and artists—including Alex Kotzky{{citation needed date=August 2015}} and John Spranger{{citation needed date=August 2015}}—despite Coles name being bannered. One last stint by Cole himself in 1949 and 1950 could not save the title. Plastic Man was cancelled in 1956 after several years of reprinting the Cole material, and new stories by others.

Additionally, Cole and writer Joe Millard created the lighthearted feature "The Barker", starring carnival barker Carnie Callhan. Introduced in National Comics #42 (May, 1944), the feature spun off into a 15-issue comic of its own (Autumn 1946 - Dec. 1949)<ref>[http://toonopedia.com/barker.htm "The Barker"] at Don Marksteins Toonopedia.  {{webarchive url=https://www.webcitation.org/6b6cHdl9u?url=http://toonopedia.com/barker.htm  date=August 27, 2015 }} from the original on August 27, 2015.</ref>

===Playboy===
{{refimprove section, except for one quote with two footnotes for it,  date= April 2014}}
Coles career by that time had taken on another dimension. In 1954, after having drawn slightly risqué, single-panel "good girl art" cartoons for magazines, using the pen name "Jake", Cole became a cartoon illustrator for Playboy. Under his own name, he produced full-page, watercolored gag cartoons of beautiful but dim girls and rich but equally dim old men. Coles art first appeared in the fifth issue; he would have at least one piece published in Playboy each month for the rest of his life.{{citation needed date=January 2014}} So popular was his work that the second item of merchandise ever licensed by Playboy (after cufflinks with the famous rabbit-head logo) was a cocktail-napkin set, "Females by Cole", featuring his cartoons.{{Citation needed date=November 2010}} Cole biographer Art Spiegelman said, "Coles goddesses were estrogen soufflés who mesmerized the ineffectual saps who lusted after them."<ref>Chun (2004), p. 8</ref><ref>Spiegelman and Kidd (2001), p. 112</ref>

===Betsy and Me===
{{main article Betsy and Me}}
In 1958, Cole created his own daily newspaper comic strip, Betsy and Me, which he sold to the Chicago Sun-Times Syndicate.<ref name=toonopedia>[http://toonopedia.com/betsynme.htm Betsy and Me] at Don Marksteins Toonopedia.  {{webarchive url=https://www.webcitation.org/6b6ZBrhVh?url=http://toonopedia.com/betsynme.htm  date=August 27, 2015 }} from the original on August 27, 2015.</ref> The strip began on May 26 and chronicled the domestic adventures of nebbishy Chester Tibbet as narrator, his wife Betsy, and their 5-year-old genius son, Farley.<ref name=toonopedia /> For it, Cole utilized "a simplified style," historian Ron Goulart wrote, "reminiscent of the drawing in the United Productions of America UPA animated cartoons."<ref name=hogans-goulart>{{cite news   url = http://cartoonician.com/jack-and-betsy-and-me/   title = Jack and Betsy and Me   authorlink= Ron Goulart   first = Ron   last= Goulart   work = Hogans Alley   publisher= Bull Moose Publishing   date=May 18, 2012   accessdate= 2013-12-29}}</ref> Betsy and Me ran for two-and-a-half months before Coles self-inflicted death; his last daily was published on September 6 and his last Sunday on September 14.

===Coles death===
Cole killed himself on August 13, 1958. R. C. Harvey described it as "one of the most baffling events in the history of cartooning".<ref>R. C. Harvey (2007), p. xx–xxi</ref> Cole was living at 703 Silver Lake Road in Cary, Illinois Cary, Illinois, about 40 miles northwest of Chicago, and told his wife at about two in the afternoon that he was picking up the mail and the newspapers. Driving his Chevrolet station wagon to Dave Donners Sport Shop in nearby Crystal Lake, Illinois Crystal Lake, he purchased a .22LR .22 caliber, single-shot Marlin Firearms Marlin rifle. He phoned a neighbor between 5:15 and 5:30&nbsp;pm to say what he was doing, and for the neighbor to tell Dorothy. Parked on a gravel road west of the intersection of Illinois Routes 176 and 14, Cole was found by three boys at approximately 6&nbsp;pm, shot in the head but still alive. A McHenry County sheriffs deputy arrived and called for an ambulance ten minutes later. Cole died at nearby Woodstock Hospital at 6:45&nbsp;pm

That morning, he had mailed two suicide notes, one to Dorothy (who at a coroners inquest testified that he had given his reasons) and one to his friend and boss, Playboy editor-publisher Hugh Hefner. The letter to his wife was never made public and the reasons for Coles suicide have remained unknown. Dorothy never again spoke with her late husbands family nor with Hefner, and remarried approximately a year later.

Coles story "Murder, Morphine and Me", which he illustrated and possibly wrote<ref>Spiegelman and Kidd (2001), p. 91, do not specify who wrote the uncredited story; the [http://comics.org/details.lasso?id=255419#2 Grand Comics Database entry for the issue] cites it as possibly written by Cole.</ref> for publisher Magazine Villages True Crime Comics No. 2 (May 1947), became a centerpiece of psychiatrist Dr. Fredric Werthams crusade against violent comic books. Wertham, author of the influential study Seduction of the Innocent, cited a particular panel of the storys dope-dealing narrator about to be stabbed in the eye with a hypodermic needle as an example of the "injury-to-the-eye" motif.<ref>Chun (2004), p. 4</ref>

In 2003, writer-artist Art Spiegelman and artist Chip Kidd collaborated on a Cole biography,<ref>Spiegelman and Kidd (2001)</ref> a portion of which had been published in The New Yorker magazine in 1999.
