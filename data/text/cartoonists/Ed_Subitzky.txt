For many years, Subitzky had a day job as an advertising copywriter.

==Early life==
Subitzky was born in and grew up in Mount Vernon, New York, just outside New York City. As a child, he read a wide variety of comic books and  Mad (magazine) Mad magazine. He was greatly influenced by the work of Harvey Kurtzman and to a lesser extent that of Will Elder, both of whom he met briefly in Mount Vernon when he was about 12 years old.

He was educated at what is now Binghamton University, where he was a mathematics major who also took many philosophy courses.

A few years later, he moved into Manhattan, and took cartooning classes at the School of Visual Arts. The classes were taught by R.O. Blechman Bob Blechman and Charles Slackman.

==National Lampoon magazine==
Subitzky ended up doing a great deal of work for National Lampoon magazine. His contributions primarily consisted of comic strips, cartoons, and humor writing.

His connection with National Lampoon magazine was first established in 1972, when contributing editor Michel Choquette visited the cartooning class which Subitzky attended.<ref>p.&nbsp;47, Levin, 2009)</ref> Choquette took a liking to Subitzkys work, and brought him over to the offices of National Lampoon.

Subitzky subsequently became a long-term contributing editor; one or more of his comic strips, cartoons, and written Article (publishing) articles appeared in almost every issue of the magazine. In September 1974, he guest-edited the "Old Age" issue of the magazine.<ref>[http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7409.html/Marks Very Large National Lampoon Site, table of contents for National Lampoon Issue September 1974, Vol. 1. No. 54]</ref>
His name remained on the Masthead (publishing) masthead of National Lampoon all through the 1970s, through the decline of the magazine in the 1980s, and almost up to the point of its eventual demise.

Shary Flenniken, in the biography on her official website, describes Subitzky as "hysterically funny and unassuming".<ref>Fedge.net, Shary Flenniken, Biography, 2005-2009, [http://www.fedge.net/sharyflenniken/] accessed 2014-6-13</ref>

===Comic strips===
Subitzkys roughly 100 comic strips for the National Lampoon included “Saturday Night on Antarius!”, “Two-way Comics!", "Eight Comics in One!”, and “Come Too Soon Comics!” Many of his comic strips ran to several pages, and featured numerous very small panels.

===Written humor===
His approximately 100 articles and written pieces for National Lampoon included “How I Spent My Summer” in the Self-Indulgence issue (December 1973, Vol. 1, No. 45)<ref>[http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7312.html Marksverylarge.com]</ref> and "Stupidworld" in the Stupid issue (March 1974, Vol 1, No 48).<ref>[http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7403.html Marksverylarge.com]</ref>

===Fumetti===
Two of the many Photo strip fumetti, also known as photo funnies, that Subitzky wrote were "The Perfect Date" and "Every Red-Blooded American Boys Dream: Three Pretty Girls Doing Just What You Want So You Can Masturbate!"

===National Lampoon  books===
In 1974, Subitzky wrote two sections of the infamous National Lampoon 1964 High School Yearbook Parody: the first piece in the yearbook, which is the Principals letter, and "In Memorium" {{sic}}, which is a parody of a student wiktionary:in memoriam In Memoriam piece.

In the same year, Subitzky wrote numerous sections of the National Lampoon  book,The Job of Sex, which was a parody of The Joy of Sex.

His writing and cartooning were reprinted in many National Lampoon anthologies.

==Other anthologies==
Pieces of his have been included in several other anthology anthologies, including the 1990 Harper/Collins  Big Book of New American Humor, and more than one collection edited by the cartoonist Sam Gross.

In 1972, a comic of Subitzkys, "Two-headed Sam in the Singles Bar!", was drawn especially for the comic book about the 1960s entitled The Someday Funnies, which was put together by Michel Choquette during the 1970s, and which was finally published in 2011.

==Works for radio==

===National Lampoon radio===
Subitzky was a writer for and an occasional performer on The National Lampoon Radio Hour, which ran for a little over a year in 1973 to 1974. He conceptualized and wrote all, or nearly all, of the “Public Disservice Announcements” (which were parodies of public service announcements), as well as a number of other pieces. Some selections from the Radio Hour work appeared on the CD album Gold Turkey.

He also conceived, wrote, and starred in a one-hour, two-episode radio play for The National Lampoon Radio Hour. The play was a spoof of popular science-fiction/Horror fiction horror dramas, and was entitled The Sluts from Space. The two episodes aired on May 25 and June 2 of 1974. Subitzky voice acting voiced the part of the science-nerd hero, Timmy Johnson, who by clever control of the supply of deodorants, manages to save the world from alien invaders disguised as beautiful and seductive women. The Sluts from Space episodes of the show are listed in detail at: [http://www.marksverylarge.com/nlrh/nlrh740525_28.html] and [http://www.marksverylarge.com/nlrh/nlrh740602_29.html].

===Horror stories===
In 1980, Subitzky wrote numerous pieces for a nationally Broadcast syndication syndicated series of five-minute horror story horror stories, which were broadcast on radio. The series was entitled The Nightwatch. Some of these stories were also made available on an album by Clack, Inc., called Ten Horror Stories: For Radio.<ref>Amazon,com The Nightwatch - Ten Horror Stories for Radio [https://www.amazon.com/The-Nightwatch-Horror-Stories-Radio/dp/B005Y0RDWY] accessed 2014-6-14</ref>

==National Lampoon comedy albums==
Subitzky was the sole author of two National Lampoon comedy albums:

* Official National Lampoon Stereo Test and Demonstration Record, 1974, was voiced by John Belushi and Chevy Chase, among others.
* The Official National Lampoon Car Stereo Test & Demonstration Tape, 1980, was on Compact Cassette cassette tape for car stereo.

==Television work with David Letterman==

===Comedy writing and performing===
Subitzky was a comedy writer on The David Letterman Show for its first season on the air in 1982, and he also appeared on the show many times, in variations of a Sketch comedy sketch which is sometimes referred to as “the imposter".

In these sketches, Letterman starts by introducing Subitzky as someone else altogether. In the earliest of his Late Night appearances, the person supposedly featured was often a minor celebrity, such as an author. After a few minutes of interviewing, Subitzky breaks down and admits to Letterman that he is not that person, and had only pretended to be that person so that he could be on television. He then runs out through the audience apologizing abjectly.

Subitzky reprised this role in 12 more appearances on Late Night with David Letterman. Although he wears a tuxedo as James Clavell, a motorcycle jacket as Don Henley, and a wig and womens clothing as "Elizabeth Callahan", usually no attempt is made to have him look more like the people he is pretending to be.

As Rolling Stone writer  David Browne explained:<ref>Website: RollingStone.com, Culture, News, "David Letterman Year One: A backstage and in-depth look at how a gap-toothed failed morning-show host and a ragtag band of misfits and rejects changed television forever", issue date
 September 29th, 2011 [https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/david-letterman-year-one-20110929] Accessed 2016-9-28</ref>

"One night, Letterman introduced Don Henley – and out came Ed Subitzky, a balding, overweight staff writer who answered all of Lettermans questions as if he actually were the Eagles drummer. At the end of the segment, Subitzky broke down and confessed, "Im not Don Henley – Im just a sick man!" before running offstage. Then, a few weeks later, Letterman would repeat the gag all over again with another celebrity name."

Subitzky has a life-long interest in both science and philosophy, and he is especially fascinated by the very challenging Hard problem of consciousness "hard problem" of consciousness, i.e. why there is a subjective component to experience.

JCS is published by Imprint Academic, of Exeter, England.

"By the time I graduated from high school I knew about bitter and sweet, but thanks to cartoonists like M.K. Brown, Gahan Wilson, and Ed Subitzky, I also knew about weird and rare and hilarious ways of changing one into the other. These three cartoonists taught me to watch the people around me and listen to how they talk and to write down what they say. But I learned the most by copying their drawings, and these three were especially good teachers." And on page 114 of the same book, Barry says, "...the first drawings I copied would leave traces in my work and drawing style that were unshakable and strong."<ref>Blabber, Blabber, Blabber: Volume 1 of Everything, Lynda Barry, 31 October 2011, page 13 & page 114, Drawn and Quarterly Comics and Graphic Novels, {{ISBN 1770460527}}; {{ISBN 978-1770460522}}</ref>
