===Graphic novels===

==== Punk Rock & Trailer Parks ====
Backderf wrote Punk Rock & Trailer Parks (SLG Publishing, 2010), a 152-page graphic novel set in 1980, during the punk rock heyday in Akron, Ohio, a music scene that produced such acts as Devo, Chrissie Hynde, and The Cramps. Punk Rock & Trailer Parks is a fictional story that follows one remarkable young man named Otto who, through talent, wits and sheer chutzpah becomes a star in the Rubber City punk scene and has memorable meetings with underground luminaries of the day, including Wendy O. Williams, Stiv Bators, Lester Bangs, and The Clash. Punk Rock & Trailer Parks was featured in the 2010 edition of Best American Comics (Houghton Mifflin).

==== My Friend Dahmer ====
My Friend Dahmer (Abrams Comic Arts, 2012) is the culmination of a comic book project first started in 1994, shortly after Jeffrey Dahmer was murdered in prison. Derfs first Dahmer story appeared in Zero Zero (comics) Zero Zero #18 (Fantagraphics, July 1997). Derf then pitched the project as a 100-page graphic novel, but failed to find a publisher. He then self-published a scaled-back 24-page My Friend Dahmer comic book in 2002. The original self-published comic book was nominated for an Eisner Award and was adapted and staged as a one-act play by the NYU Theater Dept.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.derfcity.com/crap/jd2.html  title=Young Jeffrey Dahmer  accessdate=2011-08-27  deadurl=bot: unknown  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024042431/http://www.derfcity.com/crap/jd2.html  archivedate=October 24, 2008  df= }}, p. 2</ref> The final 224-page incarnation was nominated for Ignatz Award Ignatz, Harvey Award Harvey, and Rueben Awards,<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.spxpo.com/ignatz-awards  title=Ignatz Awards 2012  publisher=The Small Press Expo  date=2010-11-28  accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref> received an Angoulême Angoulême Award and was named by Time (magazine) Time magazine as one of the top five non-fiction books of 2012.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/12/04/top-10-arts-lists/slide/derf-backderf-my-friend-dahmer/   work=Time   title=The Top 10 Everything Of 2012   date=4 December 2012}}</ref> Lev Grossman, book critic of Time Magazine Time magazine, named My Friend Dahmer as one of the "top five non-fiction books of the year."<ref>http://entertainment.time.com/2012/03/28/my-friend-dahmer-the-unspeakable-horror-of-life-in-the-1970s/</ref> A My Friend Dahmer (film) film adaptation of My Friend Dahmer, starring Ross Lynch, Anne Heche, Dallas Roberts and Vincent Kartheiser, premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival and received a general theatrical release in the fall of 2017.<ref>http://ew.com/movies/2017/05/15/ross-lynch-my-friend-dahmer-release-date/</ref> The film received generally positive reviews.<ref>{{Citation title=My Friend Dahmer url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/my_friend_dahmer/ language=en accessdate=2018-03-14}}</ref>

Trashed (Abrams Comic Arts, 2015), an Eisner Award-winning<ref>https://www.newsarama.com/30298-2016-eisner-award-winners-full-list.html</ref> fictional story based on Derfs experiences as a 19-year-old garbageman, was published as a 240-page graphic novel. The project first appeared as a 50-page magazine-size comic book (SLG Publishing, 2002) . It was Derfs first attempt at long-form storytelling and was nominated for the Eisner Award for Best Writer-artist. Derf revisited the project as a webcomic in 2010 and 2012 on his website.

==Art style ==
Backderfs art has been compared to Robert Crumb, with his use of black to "project character and menace" praised.<ref name=HP>Harrison, John. "My Friend Dahmer", Headpress 25: William Burroughs & the Flicker Machine, Headpress, 2003 p.76-9. {{ISBN 1-900486-26-1}}</ref> Derf cites Crumb as an influence, along with Mad Magazine and Spain Rodriguez. He cites Expressionism as the inspiration for his usage of heavy ink, but feels the major influence on his work is the imagery of punk subculture punk.<ref name=HP />

Backderf has contributed to many well-known national publications, including Playboy, The Wall Street Journal and The Progressive. His illustrations have also appeared on posters, T-shirts, and CD covers.

=== Exhibitions ===
Backderfs work has been displayed in many galleries and museums both in the United States and abroad. In 1995, he had a large solo show at Altered Image Gallery in Cleveland, and in 1999 the Akron Art Museum put on a retrospective of his work, titled "Apocalyptic Giggles: The Industrial Cartoon Humor of Derf."
