Derfs first Dahmer story appeared in Zero Zero (comics) Zero Zero #18 (Fantagraphics, July 1997). Derf then pitched the project as a 100-page graphic novel, but failed to find a publisher.

The project first appeared as a 50-page magazine-size comic book (SLG Publishing, 2002) . It was Derfs first attempt at long-form storytelling and was nominated for the Eisner Award for Best Writer-artist. Derf revisited the project as a webcomic in 2010 and 2012 on his website.

==Art style ==
Backderfs art has been compared to Robert Crumb, with his use of black to "project character and menace" praised.
Derf cites Crumb as an influence, along with Mad Magazine and Spain Rodriguez. He cites Expressionism as the inspiration for his usage of heavy ink, but feels the major influence on his work is the imagery of punk subculture punk.
