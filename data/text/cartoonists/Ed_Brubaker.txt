In 1997, he began to publish his cartoonist work through the small press publisher Alternative Comics (publisher) Alternative Comics. In the one-off At the Seams, a romantic triangle is explored through three stories which each depict a different participants point-of-view.<ref>{{cite web  url= http://www.indyworld.com/brubaker/review5.html title= Ed Brubaker Reviews first= John last= Sekerka date= Winter 1997 publisher= IndyWorld.com archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110924000659/http://www.indyworld.com/brubaker/review5.html archivedate= September 24, 2011 deadurl= no accessdate= November 11, 2013}}</ref> The comic was a 1997 Ignatz Award nominee for Outstanding Graphic Novel or Collection.

The story involved a convenience store clerk who gets involved in a ten-year-old murder mystery after he uses a stolen credit card. In 2004 IDW Publishing announced that Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips would collaborate on a Creator ownership creator owned Piracy pirate series titled Black Sails for them.<ref>{{cite web  url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=4068 title= Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips Set Black Sails For IDW Publishing first= Jonah last= Weiland date= September 26, 2004 publisher= Comic Book Resources archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120722024436/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=4068 archivedate= July 22, 2012 deadurl= no accessdate= November 11, 2013}}</ref> That series has not yet been published and The Fall remained the last independent comic book work by Brubaker until his work for Image Comics, which began in 2012.

===DC Comics===
Predating Brubakers Alternative Comics (publisher) Alternative Comics work by two years, Vertigo Visions: Prez (DC Comics) Prez, Smells Like Teen President (1995) was Brubakers first work for one of the two major American comic book publishers. Published by DC Comics "mature readers" imprint Vertigo Comics Vertigo, the comic was a broad political satire which revamped an obscure 1970s Joe Simon creation. Brubaker worked with his "An Accidental Death" collaborator, artist Eric Shanower, again on the comic.

Brubakers next major work for Vertigo was the Scene of the Crime (comics) Scene of the Crime four issue Limited series (comics) limited series in 1999, which marked his first collaboration with both Michael Lark and Sean Phillips, two artists who would frequently work with the writer in later years. A slacker detective story set in San Francisco, the series was critically acclaimed and the first to gain Brubaker attention from Hollywood producers.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/01/scene-crime-back-print-last  title=Scene of the Crime: back in print at last  first=Alex  last=Hern  date=January 6, 2013  publisher=New Statesman  archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6L4889T1O?url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/01/scene-crime-back-print-last  archivedate=November 12, 2013  deadurl=no  accessdate=November 11, 2013  df=mdy }}</ref>

In late 2000, Brubaker signed an exclusive contract with DC Comics.<ref>{{cite book last = Booker first = M.

Returning to Vertigo in 2000, Brubaker and artist Warren Pleece produced the science fiction series Deadenders. The series lasted 16 issues before being canceled in 2001.<ref>{{Cite book last = Irvine first = Alex author-link = Alexander C.

Also in 2001, Brubaker and artist Darwyn Cooke teamed up to revamp the Catwoman character. They started with the four issue serial "Trail of the Catwoman" which ran in Detective Comics #759–762. In the serial, private detective Slam Bradley attempts to investigate the death of Selina Kyle (aka Catwoman). The story led into a new Catwoman title in late 2001 by Brubaker and Cooke in which the characters costume, supporting cast and modus operandi were all redesigned and redeveloped.<ref>{{cite book last=Cowsill first= Alan last2=Dolan first2=Hannah, ed. chapter= 2000s title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle publisher=Dorling Kindersley year=2010 location= London, United Kingdom isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 page= 304 quote = One of DCs longest running characters got a makeover courtesy of writer Ed Brubaker and artist Darwyn Cooke as Catwoman was relaunched...With Brubakers tight, noir-like scripting and Darwyn Cookes stylish artwork, Catwomans new direction made the character more popular than ever.}}</ref> Brubaker stayed on the series until No. 37 (January 2004).

Brubaker and Marvel writer Brian Michael Bendis discussed co-writing a story which would team up DCs Batman with Marvels Daredevil (Marvel Comics character) Daredevil. The two writers were enthusiastic about their ideas, which included a fight between Batman and Marvel villain Bullseye (comics) Bullseye as well as another between Catwoman and Elektra (comics) Elektra. DC editors Matt Idelson and Bob Schreck were also enthusiastic, but DC Publisher Paul Levitz objected to the project due to a prior disagreement with Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada.<ref>{{cite web  url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=3899 title= Chicago, Day 1: Bendis Panel Goes Wild first= Seth last= Jones date= August 13, 2004 publisher= Comic Book Resources archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120722080306/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=3899 archivedate= July 22, 2012 deadurl= no accessdate= November 11, 2013}}</ref>

In early 2003, Brubaker and writer Greg Rucka created and co-wrote the Gotham Central series.<ref>Cowsill "2000s" in Dolan, p. 308: "Presented by writers Ed Brubaker and Greg Rucka, with art by Michael Lark, the series followed the night and day shifts of the Gotham City Police Department."</ref> Focusing on the activities of the Gotham City Police Department, the two writers either co-wrote storylines or wrote alternate arcs separately throughout the series, which featured artwork from Brubakers Scene of the Crime collaborator Michael Lark. The title was cancelled in 2006, shortly after Brubakers last issue.

====Wildstorm====
In 2002 Brubaker did his first work for Wildstorm, another DC imprint, with the series Point Blank (comics) Point Blank which featured the artwork of New Zealand artist Colin Wilson (comics) Colin Wilson. The series took existing concepts from the Wildstorm universe, such as Grifter (comics) Grifter (the star of the series), John Lynch (comics) John Lynch and Tao (comics) Tao and used them to set up his  Sleeper (comics) Sleeper series which debuted later that year.

A collaboration between artist Sean Phillips and Brubaker, Sleeper, featured a secret agent protagonist ("Holden Carver") who goes undercover in a super villains powerful organisation, only to have the only contact he has in law enforcement fall into a coma. With the authorities believing him a dangerous criminal, Carver is caught between the two warring sides with unclear allegiances.

In December 2003, in a unique publicity stunt conceived to help promote the first trade paperback collection of Sleeper, Brubaker organized an "arm-wrestling competition" at San Franciscos "Isotope – the comic book lounge" comic book shop. If participants were able to beat Brubaker at arm wrestling they were awarded free signed comic books. According to Brubaker, the writer wrestled 40–50 people and won most of the time, losing only eight or nine times.<ref>{{cite web url= http://newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=7423 title= Ed Brubaker: After the Arm Wrasslin first= Ed last= Brubaker date= December 22, 2003 publisher= Newsarama archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040204155611/http://newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=7423 archivedate= February 4, 2004 deadurl= yes}}</ref>

Although Sleeper was a success with critics and fans on the Internet, the series underperformed commercially, and so it was canceled after its twelfth issue. It was relaunched in 2004 with the same creators as Sleeper: Season Two<ref>{{cite web url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=3267 title= Make Mine Ed: Ed Brubaker talks Sleeper Season Two & Gotham Central first= Arune last= Singh date= March 16, 2004 publisher= Comic Book resources archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121102192702/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=3267 archivedate= November 2, 2012 deadurl= no accessdate= November 11, 2013}}</ref> but also ended with its twelfth issue.

Brubakers other work for Wildstorm during this period was the third volume of Authority (comics) The Authority. Brubaker first tackled the characters with artist Jim Lee on the one issue special Coup Détat: Sleeper which showed how a series of events led the Authority (a powerful team of super-humans) to take over the United States. Later that year and throughout 2005 Brubaker and artist Dustin Nguyen (artist) Dustin Nguyen produced the 12 issue The Authority: Revolution which explored the ramifications of the teams actions.

In February 2005 Brubaker signed his first exclusive contract with Marvel, the deal allowing the writer to finish out his prior commitments for DC on Gotham Central and Sleeper (comics) Sleeper.<ref>{{cite web  url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&old=1&id=4781 title= Official: Marvel Announces Ed Brubaker Exclusive first= Jonah last= Weiland date= February 7, 2005 publisher= Comic Book Resources archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131101230034/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&old=1&id=4781 archivedate= November 1, 2013 deadurl= no}}</ref>

In February 2010, a controversy arose with Captain America No. 602, which depicted a group of anti-tax protesters, understood by some readers to be a Tea Party movement Tea Party, which was characterized by the Falcon (comics) Falcon as exclusively white and racist group. Brubaker and Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada apologized for the matter, explaining that although the group was not intended by Brubaker to represent any particular real-life group, one of the signs depicted in the scene read, "Tea Bag The Libs Before They Tea Bag YOU!", which was not written by Brubaker, but was added by letterer Joe Caramagna, who, under deadline pressures, added messages on signs that were found to still be blank, based on signs he saw on the Internet.
