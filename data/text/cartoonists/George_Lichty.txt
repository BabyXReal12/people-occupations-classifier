Scenes in his cartoons were often set in the offices of commissars or the showrooms of "Belchfire" dealers with enormous cars in the background. His series Is Party Line, Comrade! also skewered various Soviet bureaucrats, who usually were drawn wearing a five-pointed star medal labeled "Hero".

Lichtys cartoon style had an influence on cartoon animation in what was known as the "animation smear technique," dubbed the "Lichty style" by Warner Bros. animator Rod Scribner. Lichty also influenced cartoons drawn by Joe Teller, as evidenced in the book, "When Im Dead All This Will Be Yours!": Joe Teller&mdash;A Portrait by His Kid (2000) by Teller (magician) Teller (of Penn & Teller). The artist Ed Ruscha, who originally planned to be a cartoonist, incorporated a Lichty cartoon into one of his artworks.
