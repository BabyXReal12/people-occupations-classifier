Rosemary Elizabeth "Posy" Simmonds MBE (born 9 August 1945) is a British newspaper cartoonist and writer and illustrator of Childrens literature childrens books. She is best known for her long association with The Guardian, for which she has drawn the series Gemma Bovery (2000) and Tamara Drewe (2005–06), both later published as books.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/articles/article/posy_simmonds/ title=Paul Gravett interviewing Posy Simmonds publisher=}}</ref> Her style gently satirises the Social structure of Britain#20th century English middle classes and in particular those of a literary bent. Both of the published books feature a "doomed heroine", much in the style of the 18th- and 19th-century Gothic novel gothic romantic novel, to which they often allude, but with an ironic, modernist slant.

==Career==
Posy Simmonds was born in Berkshire and educated at Queen Annes School, Caversham, Berkshire Caversham. She studied at the University of Paris Sorbonne before returning to London to attend Central School of Art & Design.<ref>{{cite web url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2045620.stm  title=BBC News, June 2002  publisher=BBC News  date=14 June 2002  accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref> She started her newspaper career drawing a daily cartoon, "Bear", for The Sun (United Kingdom) The Sun in 1969. She contributed humorous illustrations to The Times from 1968 to 1970. She also contributed to Cosmopolitan (magazine) Cosmopolitan, and a satirical cartoon to Tariq Alis The Black Dwarf (newspaper) Black Dwarf magazine. She moved to The Guardian as an illustrator in 1972.

In May 1977 she started drawing a weekly comic strip for The Guardian, initially titled The Silent Three of St Botolphs as a tribute to the 1950s strip The Silent Three by Evelyn Flinders. It began as a silly parody of girls adventure stories making satirical comments about contemporary life. The strip soon focused on three 1950s schoolfriends in their later, middle-class and nearly middle-aged lives: Wendy Weber, a former nurse married to polytechnic (United Kingdom) polytechnic sociology lecturer George with a large brood of children; Jo Heep, married to whisky salesman Edmund with two rebellious teenagers; and Trish Wright, married to philandering advertising executive Stanhope and with a young baby. The strip, which was latterly untitled and usually known just as "Posy", ran until the late 1980s. It was collected into a number of books: Mrs Webers Diary, Pick of Posy, Very Posy and Pure Posy, and one original book featuring the same characters, True Love. Her later cartoons for The Guardian and The Spectator were collected as Mustnt Grumble in 1993.

In 1981, Simmonds was named Cartoonist of the Year<ref>{{cite web url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2045620.stm  title=Simmondss satirical touch  publisher=BBC News  date=14 June 2002  accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref> in the British Press Awards.<ref>{{cite web url=http://pressawards.org.uk/page-view.php?pagename=1980-1989-Winners title=Press Awards Winners 1980 - 1989 accessdate=9 July 2015}}</ref> In 1982 and 1983 she contributed a regular full-page strip to Harpers Magazine in America. In 1987 Simmonds turned her hand to writing, as well as illustrating, childrens books. Fred, the story of a cat with a secret life, was later filmed as Famous Fred and nominated for the Academy Award for Animated Short Film and several BAFTAs. Her other childrens books include Lulu and the Flying Babies, The Chocolate Wedding and Lavender.

In the late 1990s Posy returned to the pages of The Guardian with Gemma Bovery, which reworked the story of Gustave Flauberts Madame Bovary into a satirical tale of English expatriates in France. It was published as a graphic novel in 1999 and was made into a feature film, directed by Anne Fontaine in 2014.<ref>{{cite web title=Posy Simmonds lecture url=https://thefalmouthschoolofart.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/posy-simmonds-lecture-wednesday-4-march-5pm/ date=2 March 2015 author=The Falmouth School of Art accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref> Literary Life appeared in The Guardians "Review" section on Saturdays from November 2002 until December 2004.
