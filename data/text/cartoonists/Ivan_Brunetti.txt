Noted for combining blackly humorous taboo-laden subject matter with simplified and exaggerated cartoon drawing styles, Brunetti was strongly influenced by Charles M. Schulz and Peanuts. His best known comic work is his largely autobiographical series Schizo, of which four issues appeared between 1994 and 2006, the first 3 of which have been collected as Misery Loves Comedy.<ref name=tdc20070724>{{cite web title=Misery Loves Comedy by Ivan Brunetti url=http://thedailycrosshatch.com/2007/07/24/misery-loves-comedy-by-ivan-brunetti/ publisher=The Daily Cross Hatch author=Brian Heater date=24 July 2007}}</ref> Schizo #4 received the 2006 Ignatz Award for Outstanding Comic of the Year.<ref name=s4-ig>{{cite web title=2006 Ignatz Award Recipients url=http://www.spxpo.com/2006-ignatz-award-recipients publisher=Small Press Expo}}</ref>
