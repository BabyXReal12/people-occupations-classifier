==Biography==
{{refimprove section date=May 2016}}
As a young man Siné studied drawing and graphic arts, while earning a living as a cabaret singer. His first published drawing appeared in France Dimanche in 1952. Siné received the {{Interlanguage link multi Prix de lHumour noir fr}} in 1955 for his collection Complainte sans Paroles. His series of drawings on cats was his breakthrough. He then started working for LExpress (France) LExpress as a political cartoonist.

Sinés anti-colonialism caused controversy during the Algerian War of Independence Algerian war. He was sued a number of times, being defended by Jacques Vergès, then a lawyer for the National Liberation Front (Algeria) Algerian Liberation Front.

In 1962 Siné left LExpress and published a book of his work called Siné Massacre, noted for its anti-colonialism, anti-capitalism, anti-clericalism and anarchism.{{citation needed date=January 2015}}

In reviewing the book, the British satirical magazine Private Eye described Sinés cartoons as "grotesque", and criticised publisher Penguin Books for its managerial incompetence.<ref>Private Eye #130 (9 December 1966), p. 3: {{blockquote When an old family concern (like the BBC) decides to get with-it, you can be sure that the results will be farcical. So with Penguin Books. ... Now, as part of their Christmas fare comes a book of grotesque cartoons — by Siné, the tone of which is well conveyed by the first drawing which shows a nun undressing while Christ leers salaciously down at her from the crucifix on the wall. Penguin (like the BBC) is so incompetently run that those in authority did not realise the nature of the work until it was too late. Now a full-scale boardroom rumpus has developed and resignations may follow. (Needless to say W.H. Smith is handling the book without a murmur).}}</ref>

In 1965 Siné became involved in a power struggle at Penguin Books. During an attempt by chief editor Tony Godwin and the board of directors to remove the company founder Allen Lane, Lane stole and Book burning burned the entire print run of the English edition of Sinés book Massacre, which was reportedly deeply offensive.<ref>Narrated by Lane biographer Jeremy Lewis on BBC Radio in 2010, http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/player/b00tjrgz</ref>

In May 1968, together with Jean-Jacques Pauvert, Siné launched LEnragé, a short-lived satirical journal associated with the May 1968 events in France.{{cn date=May 2017}}

==Controversy and sacking==
In 1982, shortly after a terrorist attack had taken place on Jews in Paris, Siné gave an interview on the radio during which he stated: "Yes, I am anti-Semitic and I am not scared to admit it [...] I want all Jews to live in fear, unless they are pro-Palestinian. Let them die." He later apologised for his comments.<ref name=obse/>

In July 2008, Sinés column in the magazine Charlie Hebdo contained this comment on Jean Sarkozys rumoured impending conversion to Judaism so he could marry a Jewish heiress of the wealthy Darty family, Jessica Sebaoun-Darty: "Hell go a long way in life, this lad!" <ref>{{cite news title=Anti-semitic satire divides liberal Paris author=Jason Burke url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/03/france.pressandpublishing newspaper=The Guardian date=3 August 2008 accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref> Sarkozy and Sebaoun-Darty married but Sarkozy has affirmed that he did not convert to Judaism.

The magazines editor, Philippe Val, ordered Siné to write a letter of apology or face termination. The cartoonist said he would rather "cut his own balls off", and was promptly fired. Both sides subsequently filed lawsuits, and in December 2010, Siné won a 40,000-euro court judgment against his former publisher for wrongful termination.<ref>[http://www.actuabd.com/+Le-Tribunal-de-Grande-Instance+ "Le Tribunal de Grande Instance donne raison à Siné contre Charlie Hebdo"], ActuaBD.com, 11 December 2010.</ref>

Siné reported a death threat posted on a site run by the Jewish Defense League. The text said "20 centimeters of stainless steel in the gut, that should teach the bastard to stop and think."<ref>[http://www.svt.se/kultur/hatsk-fransk-debatt-om-antisemitism "Hätsk fransk debatt om antisemitism"], Sveriges Television, 13 August 2008.</ref>
