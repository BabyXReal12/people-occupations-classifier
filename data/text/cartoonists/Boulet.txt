Boulet, the pen name for Gilles Roussel ({{IPA-fr bulɛ - Fr-Boulet.ogg}}), is a People of France French comic book creator and cartoonist born 1 February 1975 in Meaux, France. He was among the first French cartoonists to become famous by publishing a blog BD, starting in July 2004.

==Biography==
Roussel studied art at the :fr:École supérieure des arts décoratifs de Strasbourg Graduate School of Decorative Arts in Strasbourg. In 2001, he published his first comic strip, Raghnarok. He then started a cartoon blog on the internet in July 2004,
which made him well known in France. Since then, he has worked for French comics strip magazine Tchô ! and Psikopat, and on many others as an author or cartoonist. He replaced Lewis Trondheim as cartoonist of the comic strip Dungeon (comics) Donjon Zénith.

The popularity of his blog allowed him to become the first "Godfather"
of the newly created Paris Comic Strip Blog Festival (Festival des blogs BD), in 2005.

The drawings from his blog were first published in 2008, entitled "Notes".
Seven volumes have been published as of December 2012.

Roussel participated in the Francophone French-speaking 24-hour comics day in Montreal in 2008.
He started an English version of his blog in November 2009,
where he republished all of his posts from the French blog from its start in 2004 in chronological order, at the rate of three posts per week.

In 2017, Boulet started a collaboration with the publisher Delcourt (publisher) Delcourt in order to produce Project Octopus, a collection of scientific comic books evoking subjects as diverse as the exploration of Mars to philosophy. Four to five books a year are planned to be released under this project. These books are written and drawn by artists such as Florence Porcel, Erwann Surcouf, and Héloïse Chochois, but are edited by Boulet.
