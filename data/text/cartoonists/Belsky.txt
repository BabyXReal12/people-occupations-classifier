In 1944, Margaret and Franta married, with Belsky taking on her husbands name for her single word signature, disguising her gender.<ref name=obit /> Belsky started working for the Daily Herald (UK newspaper) Daily Herald in 1951 and became their first ever pocket cartoonist, at the same time becoming the first woman to draw a daily front-page cartoon.<ref name=":0" />

Belsky was dismissive of her own work, calling herself "just a hack." She didnt collect her work, though it was estimated that she may have drawn more than 6,000 cartoons while working for the Daily Herald. When the Daily Herald, later The Sun (United Kingdom) The Sun, was taken over by Rupert Murdoch in 1969, Belsky refused to work for him. Instead she contributed cartoons for many other newspapers and magazines, including The Strand Magazine, Punch, The Guardian, John Bull (magazine) John Bull and Sunday Graphic. She also became an illustrator for childrens books, including designing the covers for various Penguin books.<ref name=":0" /> Belsky died on 26 January 1989.<ref>{{Cite book title = Public Sculpture of Greater Manchester last = Wyke first = Terry publisher = Liverpool University Press year = 2005 isbn = 9780853235675 location =  pages = 437–438}}</ref>
