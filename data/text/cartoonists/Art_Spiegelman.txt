Art Spiegelman ({{IPAc-en ˈ s p iː g əl m ən}}; born Itzhak Avraham ben Zeev on February 15, 1948) is an American cartoonist, editor, and comics advocate best known for his graphic novel Maus.  His work as co-editor on the comics magazines Arcade (comics magazine) Arcade and Raw (magazine) Raw has been influential, and from 1992 he spent a decade as contributing artist for The New Yorker.  He is married to designer and editor Françoise Mouly and is the father of writer Nadja Spiegelman.

Spiegelman began his career with the Topps bubblegum card company in the mid-1960s, which was his main financial support for two decades; there he co-created parodic series such as Wacky Packages in the 1960s and the Garbage Pail Kids in the 1980s.  He gained prominence in the underground comix scene in the 1970s with short, experimental, and often autobiographical work.  A selection of these strips appeared in the collection Breakdowns (comics) Breakdowns in 1977, after which Spiegelman turned focus to the book-length Maus, about his relationship with his father, a Holocaust survivor.  The postmodern book depicts Germans as cats, Jews as mice, and ethnic Poles as pigs, and took thirteen years to create until its completion in 1991. It won a special Pulitzer Prize in 1992 and has gained a reputation as a pivotal work, responsible for bringing scholarly attention to the comics medium.

Spiegelman and Mouly edited eleven issues of Raw from 1980 to 1991.  The oversized {{not a typo comics}} and graphics magazine helped introduce talents who became prominent in alternative comics, such as Charles Burns (cartoonist) Charles Burns, Chris Ware, and Ben Katchor, and introduced several foreign cartoonists to the English-speaking comics world.  Beginning in the 1990s, the couple worked for The New Yorker, which Spiegelman left to work on In the Shadow of No Towers (2004), about his reaction to the September 11 attacks in New York in 2001.

Spiegelman advocates for greater comics literacy.  As an editor, a teacher at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, and a lecturer, Spiegelman has promoted better understanding of comics and has mentored younger cartoonists.

Art Spiegelmans parents were Polish Jews {{Not a typo Władysław}} (1906–1982) and {{not a typo Andzia}} (1912–1968) Spiegelman.  His father was born Zeev Spiegelman, with the Hebrew name Zeev ben Avraham. Władysław was his Polish name, and Władek (or Vladek in Russification Russified form) was a diminutive of this name. He was also known as Wilhelm under History of Poland (1939–45) the German occupation, and upon immigration to the United States he took the name William. His mother was born Andzia Zylberberg, with the Hebrew name Hannah. She took the name Anna upon her immigration to the US. In Spiegelmans Maus, from which the couple are best known, Spiegelman used the spellings "Vladek" and "Anja", which he believed would be easier for Americans to pronounce.{{sfn Spiegelman 2011 p=16}}  The surname Spiegelman is German for "mirror man".{{sfn Teicholz 2008}}

In 1937, the Spiegelmans had one other son, Rysio (spelled "Richieu" in Maus), who died before Art was born{{sfn Spiegelman 2011 p=18}} at the age of five or six.{{sfn Hatfield 2005 p=146}} During the Holocaust, Spiegelmans parents sent Rysio to stay with an aunt with whom they believed he would be safe. In 1943, the aunt poisoned herself, along with Rysio and two other young family members in her care, so that the Nazi Party Nazis could not take them to the extermination camps. After the war, the Spiegelmans, unable to accept that Rysio was dead, searched orphanages all over Europe in the hope of finding him. Spiegelman talked of having a sort of sibling rivalry with his "ghost brother"—he felt unable to compete with an "ideal" brother who "never threw tantrums or got in any kind of trouble".{{sfn Hirsch 2011 p=37}} Of 85 Spiegelman relatives alive at the beginning of World War II, only 13 are known to have survived the Holocaust.{{sfn Kois 2011}}

==Life and career==
===Early life===
File:Hs-art-design.jpg right thumb alt=High School of Art and Design building Spiegelman graduated from the High School of Art and Design in 1965.

Spiegelman was born Itzhak Avraham ben Zeev{{sfn Spiegelman 2011 p=18}} in Stockholm, Sweden, on February 15, 1948.  He immigrated with his parents to the US in 1951.{{sfn Witek 2007b p=xvii}}  Upon immigration his name was registered as Arthur Isadore, but he later had his given name changed to Art.{{sfn Spiegelman 2011 p=18}}  Initially the family settled in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and then relocated to Rego Park, Queens Rego Park in Queens, New York City, in 1957.  He began cartooning in 1960{{sfn Witek 2007b p=xvii}} and imitated the style of his favorite comic books, such as Mad (magazine) Mad.  At Russell Sage Junior High School, where he was an honors student, he produced the Mad-inspired fanzine Blasé.  He was earning money from his drawing by the time he reached high school and sold artwork to the original Long Island Press and other outlets.  His talent was such that he caught the eyes of United Media United Features Syndicate, who offered him the chance to produce a Comic strip syndication syndicated comic strip.  Dedicated to the idea of art as expression, he turned down this commercial opportunity.{{sfn Horowitz 1997 p=401}}  He attended the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan beginning in 1963.  He met  Woody Gelman, the art director of Topps Topps Chewing Gum Company, who encouraged Spiegelman to apply to Topps after graduating high school.{{sfn Witek 2007b p=xvii}}  At 15 Spiegelman received payment for his work from a Rego Park newspaper.{{sfn Campbell 2008 p=56}}

After he graduated in 1965, Spiegelmans parents urged him to pursue the financial security of a career such as dentistry, but he chose instead to enroll at Binghamton University Harpur College to study art and philosophy.  While there, he got a freelance art job at Topps, which provided him with an income for the next two decades.{{sfnm 1a1=Horowitz 1y=1997 p=401 2a1=DArcy 2y=2011}}

File:New York State Inebriate Asylum.JPG left thumb alt=Binghamton State Mental Hospital After Spiegelmans release from New York State Inebriate Asylum Binghamton State Mental Hospital, his mother committed suicide.

Spiegelman attended Harpur College from 1965 until 1968, where he worked as staff cartoonist for the college newspaper and edited a college humor magazine.{{sfn Witek 2007b pp=xvii–xviii}}  After a summer internship when he was 18, Topps hired him for Gelmans Product Development Department{{sfn Jamieson 2010 p=116}} as a creative consultant making trading cards and related products in 1966, such as the Wacky Packages series of parodic trading cards begun in 1967.{{sfn Witek 2007b pp=xviii}}

Spiegelman began selling self-published underground comix on street corners in 1966.  He had cartoons published in underground publications such as the East Village Other and traveled to San Francisco for a few months in 1967, where the underground comix scene was just beginning to burgeon.{{sfn Witek 2007b pp=xviii}}

In late winter 1968 Spiegelman suffered a brief but intense Mental breakdown nervous breakdown,{{sfnm 1a1=Kaplan 1y=2006 1p=102 2a1=Campbell 2y=2008 2p=56}} which cut his university studies short.{{sfn Witek 2007b pp=xviii}}  He has said that at the time he was taking Lysergic acid diethylamide LSD with great frequency.{{sfnm 1a1=Kaplan 1y=2006 1p=102 2a1=Campbell 2y=2008 2p=56}}  He spent a month in New York State Inebriate Asylum Binghamton State Mental Hospital, and shortly after he got out his mother committed suicide following the death of her only surviving brother.{{sfnm 1a1=Fathers 1y=2007 1p=122 2a1=Gordon 2y=2004 3a1=Horowitz 3y=1997 3p=401}}

===Underground comix (1971–1977)===
In 1971, after several visits, Spiegelman moved to San Francisco{{sfn Witek 2007b pp=xviii}} and became a part of the Counterculture of the 1960s countercultural underground comix movement that had been developing there.  Some of the {{not a typo comix}} he produced during this period include The Compleat Mr. Infinity (1970), a ten-page booklet of explicit comic strips, and The Viper Vicar of Vice, Villainy and Vickedness (1972),{{sfn Horowitz 1997 p=402}} a Transgressive art transgressive work in the vein of fellow underground cartoonist S. Clay Wilson.{{sfn Kaplan 2006 p=103}}  Spiegelmans work also appeared in underground magazines such as Gothic Blimp Works, Bijou Funnies, Young Lust (comics) Young Lust,{{sfn Witek 2007b pp=xviii}} Real Pulp, and Bizarre Sex,{{sfn Epel 2007 p=144}} and were in a variety of styles and genres as Spiegelman sought his Writers voice artistic voice.{{sfn Kaplan 2006 p=103}}  He also did a number of cartoons for Pornographic magazine mens magazines such as Cavalier (magazine) Cavalier, The Dude (magazine) The Dude, and Gent (magazine) Gent.{{sfn Witek 2007b pp=xviii}}

In 1972, Justin Green (cartoonist) Justin Green asked Spiegelman to do a three-page strip for the first issue of Funny
<!-- This spelling is correct!!! -->
{{Not a typo Aminals}}
<!-- Please do not "correct" it!!! -->
{{sic}}.{{sfn Witek 1989 p=103}}  He wanted to do one about racism, and at first considered a story{{sfn Kaplan 2008 p=140}} with African-Americans as mice and cats taking on the role of the Ku Klux Klan.{{sfn Conan 2011}}  Instead, he turned to the Holocaust that his parents had survived.  He titled the strip "Maus" and depicted the Jews as mice persecuted by die Katzen, which were Nazis as cats.  The narrator related the story to a mouse named "Mickey Mouse Mickey".{{sfn Witek 1989 p=103}}  With this story Spiegelman felt he had found his voice.{{sfn Campbell 2008 p=56}}

Seeing Greens revealingly autobiographical Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary while in-progress in 1971 inspired Spiegelman to produce "Prisoner on the Hell Planet", an expressionistic work that dealt with his mothers suicide; it appeared in 1972 in Short Order Comix {{No.}}1,{{sfn Witek 1989 p=98}} which he edited.{{sfn Witek 2007b pp=xviii}}  Spiegelmans work thereafter went through a phase of increasing formal experimentation;{{sfn Chute 2012 p=413}} the Apex Treasury of Underground Comics in 1974 quotes him: "As an art form the comic strip is barely in its infancy.  So am I.  Maybe well grow up together."
The often-reprinted{{sfn Hatfield 2012 p=138}} "Ace Hole, Midget Detective" of 1974 was a Cubism Cubist-style nonlinear narrative nonlinear parody of hardboiled hardboiled crime fiction full of non sequitur (literary device) non sequiturs.{{sfnm 1a1=Hatfield 1y=2012 1p=138 2a1=Chute 2y=2012 2p=413}}  "A Day at the Circuits" of 1975 is a recursive single-page strip about alcoholism and depression in which the reader follows the character through multiple never-ending pathways.{{sfn Kuskin 2010 p=68}}  "Nervous Rex: The Malpractice Suite" of 1976 is made up of cut-out panels from the soap-opera comic strip Rex Morgan, M.D. refashioned in such a way as to defy coherence.{{sfn Chute 2012 p=413}}

In 1973 Spiegelman edited a Pornography pornographic and Psychedelia psychedelic book of quotations and dedicated it to his mother.  Co-edited with Bob Schneider, it was called Whole Grains: A Book of Quotations.{{sfnm 1a1=Rothberg 1y=2000 1p=214 2a1=Witek 2y=2007b 2p=xviii}}  In 1974–1975, he taught a studio cartooning class at the Academy of Art University San Francisco Academy of Art.{{sfn Horowitz 1997 p=402}}

By the mid-1970s, the underground comix movement was encountering a slowdown.  To give cartoonists a safe berth, Spiegelman co-edited the anthology Arcade (comics magazine) Arcade with Bill Griffith, in 1975 and 1976.  Arcade was printed by Print Mint The Print Mint and lasted seven issues, five of which had covers by Robert Crumb.  It stood out from similar publications by having an editorial plan, in which Spiegelman and Griffith attempt to show how comics connect to the broader realms of artistic and literary culture.  Spiegelmans own work in Arcade tended to be short and concerned with formal experimentation.{{sfn Grishakova Ryan 2010 pp=67–68}}  Arcade also introduced art from ages past, as well as contemporary literary pieces by writers such as William S. Burroughs and Charles Bukowski.{{sfn Buhle 2004 p=252}}  In 1975, Spiegelman moved back to New York City,{{sfn Witek 2007b p=xix}} which put most of the editorial work for Arcade on the shoulders of Griffith and his cartoonist wife, Diane Noomin.  This, combined with distribution problems and retailer indifference, led to the magazines 1976 demise.  For a time, Spiegelman swore he would never edit another magazine.{{sfn Kaplan 2006 p=108}}

Françoise Mouly, an architectural student on a hiatus from her studies at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts Beaux-Arts in Paris, arrived in New York in 1974.  While looking for comics from which to practice reading English, she came across Arcade (comics magazine) Arcade.  Avant-garde filmmaker friend Ken Jacobs introduced Mouly and Spiegelman, when Spiegelman was visiting, but they did not immediately develop a mutual interest.  Spiegelman moved back to New York later in the year.  Occasionally the two ran across each other.  After she read "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" Mouly felt the urge to contact him.  An eight-hour phone call led to a deepening of their relationship.  Spiegelman followed her to France when she had to return to fulfill obligations in her architecture course.{{sfn Heer 2013 pp=26–30}}

Spiegelman introduced Mouly to the world of comics and helped her find work as a colorist for Marvel Comics.{{sfn Heller 2004 p=137}}  After returning to the US in 1977, Mouly ran into visa problems, which the couple solved by getting married.{{sfn Heer 2013 p=41}}  The couple began to make yearly trips to Europe to explore the comics scene, and brought back European comics to show to their circle of friends.{{sfn Heer 2013 pp=47–48}}  Mouly assisted in putting together the lavish, oversized collection of Spiegelmans experimental strips Breakdowns (comics) Breakdowns in 1977.{{sfn Heer 2013 pp=45–47}}

===Raw and Maus (1978–1991)===
File:Auschwitz entrance.JPG thumb alt= Spiegelman visited the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1979 as research for Maus; his parents had been imprisoned there.

Breakdowns suffered poor distribution and sales, and 30% of the print run was unusable due to printing errors, an experience that motivated Mouly to gain control over the printing process.{{sfn Heer 2013 pp=45–47}}  She took courses in offset printing and bought a printing press for her loft,{{sfn Heer 2013 p=49}} on which she was to print parts of{{sfn Kaplan 2006 pp=111–112}} a new magazine she insisted on launching with Spiegelman.{{sfn Kaplan 2006 p=109}}  With Mouly as publisher, Spiegelman and Mouly co-edited Raw (magazine) Raw starting in July 1980.{{sfn Reid 2007 p=225}}  The first issue was subtitled "The Graphix Magazine of Postponed Suicides".{{sfn Kaplan 2006 p=109}}  While it included work from such established underground cartoonists as Crumb and Griffith,{{sfn Kaplan 2006 p=108}} Raw focused on publishing artists who were virtually unknown, avant-garde cartoonists such as Charles Burns (cartoonist) Charles Burns, Lynda Barry, Chris Ware, Ben Katchor, and Gary Panter, and introduced English-speaking audiences to translations of foreign works by José Antonio Muñoz José Muñoz, Chéri Samba, Joost Swarte, Yoshiharu Tsuge,{{sfn Chute 2012 p=413}} Jacques Tardi, and others.{{sfn Kaplan 2006 p=109}}

With the intention of creating a book-length work based on his fathers recollections of the Holocaust{{sfn Kaplan 2008 p=171}} Spiegelman began to interview his father again in 1978{{sfn Fathers 2007 p=125}} and made a research visit in 1979 to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where his parents had been imprisoned by the Nazi Party Nazis.{{sfn Blau 2008}}  The book, Maus, appeared one chapter at a time as an insert in Raw beginning with the second issue in December 1980.{{sfn Kaplan 2006 p=113}}  Spiegelmans father did not live to see its completion; he died on 18 August 1982.{{sfn Witek 2007b p=xix}}  Spiegelman learned in 1985 that Steven Spielberg was producing an animated film about Jewish mice who escape persecution in Eastern Europe by fleeing to the United States.  Spiegelman was sure the film, An American Tail (1986), was inspired by Maus and became eager to have his unfinished book come out before the movie to avoid comparisons.{{sfnm 1a1=Kaplan 1y=2006 1p=118 2a1=Kaplan 2y=2008 2p=172}}  He struggled to find a publisher{{sfn Kois 2011}} until in 1986, after the publication in The New York Times of a rave review of the work-in-progress, Pantheon Books Pantheon agreed to release a collection of the first six chapters.  The volume was titled Maus: A Survivors Tale and subtitled My Father Bleeds History.{{sfnm 1a1=Kaplan 1y=2008 1p=171 2a1=Kaplan 2y=2006 2p=118}}  The book found a large audience, in part because it was sold in bookstores rather than in direct market direct-market comic shops, which by the 1980s had become the dominant outlet for comic books.{{sfn Kaplan 2006 p=115}}

Spiegelman began teaching at the School of Visual Arts in New York in 1978, and continued until 1987,{{sfn Witek 2007b p=xix}} teaching alongside his heroes Harvey Kurtzman and Will Eisner.{{sfn Kaplan 2006 p=111}}  Spiegelman had an essay published in Print (magazine) Print entitled "{{not a typo Commix}}: An Idiosyncratic Historical and Aesthetic Overview".{{sfn Witek 2007b p=xx}}  In 1990 Spiegelman he had an essay called "High Art Lowdown" published in Artforum critiquing the High/Low exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.{{sfn Witek 2007b p=xx}}

In the wake of the success of the Cabbage Patch Kids series of dolls, Spiegelman created the card series Garbage Pail Kids for Topps in 1985.  Similar to the Wacky Packages series, the Gross out gross-out factor of the cards was controversial with parent groups, and its popularity started a gross-out fad among children.{{sfn Bellomo 2010 p=154}}  Spiegelman called Topps his "House of Medici Medici" for the autonomy and financial freedom working for the company had given him.  The relationship was nevertheless strained over issues of credit and ownership of the original artwork.  In 1989 Topps auctioned off pieces of art Spiegelman had created rather than returning them to him, and Spiegelman broke the relation.{{sfn Witek 2007a}}

Hired by Tina Brown{{sfn Campbell 2008 p=59}} as a contributing artist in 1992, Spiegelman worked for The New Yorker for ten years.  Spiegelmans first cover appeared on the February 15, 1993, Valentines Day issue and showed a black West Indian woman and a Hasidic Judaism Hasidic man kissing.  The cover caused turmoil at The New Yorker offices.  Spiegelman intended it to reference the Crown Heights riot of 1991 in which racial tensions led to the murder of a Jewish yeshiva student.{{sfnm 1a1=Mendelsohn 1y=2003 1p=180 2a1=Campbell 2y=2008 2p=59 3a1=Witek 3y=2007b 3p=xx}}  Spiegelman had twenty-one New Yorker covers published,{{sfn Kaplan 2006 p=119}} and submitted a number which were rejected for being too outrageous.{{sfn Fox 2012}}

Hellman published a "Legal Action Comics" benefit book to cover his legal costs, to which Spiegelman contributed a back-cover cartoon in which he relieves himself on a Rall-shaped urinal.{{sfn Arnold 2001}}

The towers were printed in black on a slightly darker black field employing standard four-color printing inks with an overprinted clear varnish.

Spiegelman responded to the September 11 attacks with In the Shadow of No Towers, commissioned by German newspaper Die Zeit, where it appeared throughout 2003.

In the June 2006 edition of Harpers Magazine Spiegelman had an article published on the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy; some interpretations of Islamic law prohibit the Depictions of Muhammad depiction of Muhammad.  The Canadian chain of booksellers Indigo Books and Music Indigo refused to sell the issue.  Called "Drawing Blood: Outrageous Cartoons and the Art of Outrage", the article surveyed the sometimes dire effect political cartooning has for its creators, ranging from Honoré Daumier, who spent time in prison for his satirical work; to George Grosz, who faced exile.  To Indigo the article seemed to promote the continuance of racial caricature.  An internal memo  advised Indigo staff to tell people: "the decision was made based on the fact that the content about to be published has been known to ignite demonstrations around the world."{{sfn Adams 2006}}  In response to the cartoons, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called for submissions of antisemitic cartoons.  Spiegelman produced a cartoon of a line of prisoners being led to the gas chambers; one stops to look at the corpses around him and says, "Ha! Ha! Ha! What’s really hilarious is that none of this is actually happening!"{{sfn Brean 2008}}

To promote literacy in young children, Mouly encouraged publishers to publish comics for children.{{sfn Heer 2013 p=115}}  Disappointed by publishers lack of response, from 2008 she self-published a line of easy readers called Toon Books, by artists such as Spiegelman, Renée French, and Rutu Modan, and promotes the books to teachers and librarians for their educational value.{{sfn Heer 2013 p=116}}  Spiegelmans Jack and the Box was one of the inaugural books in 2008.{{sfn Publishers Weekly staff 2008}}

In 2011 MetaMaus followed—a book-length analysis of Maus by Spiegelman and Hillary Chute with a DVD-ROM update of the earlier CD-ROM.{{sfn Heater 2011}}

Library of America commissioned Spiegelman to edit the two-volume Lynd Ward: Six Novels in Woodcuts, which appeared in 2010, collecting all of Lynd Ward Wards wordless novels with an introduction and annotations by Spiegelman.  The project led to a touring show in 2014 about wordless novels called Wordless! with live music by saxophonist Phillip Johnston.{{sfn Artsy 2014}}  Art Spiegelmans Co-Mix: A Retrospective débuted at Angoulême in 2012 and by the end of 2014 had traveled to Paris, Cologne, Vancouver, New York, and Toronto.{{sfn Solomon 2014 p=1}}  A book complementing the showed titled Co-Mix: A Retrospective of Comics, Graphics, and Scraps appeared in 2013.{{sfn Randle 2013}}

In 2015, after six writers refused to sit on a panel at the PEN American Center in protest of the planned "freedom of expression courage award" for the satirical French periodical Charlie Hebdo following the Charlie Hebdo shooting shooting at its headquarters earlier in the year, Spiegelman agreed to be one of the replacement hosts,{{sfn Chow 2015}} along with other names in comics such as writer Neil Gaiman.  Spiegelman retracted a cover he had submitted to a Gaiman-edited "saying the unsayable" issue of New Statesman when the management declined to print strip of Spiegelmans.  The strip, titled "Notes from a First Amendment Fundamentalist", depicts Muhammad, and Spiegelman believed the rejection was censorship, though the magazine asserted it never intended to run the cartoon.{{sfnm 1a1=Krayewski 1y=2015 2a1=Heer 2y=2015}}

==Private life==
File:Françoise Mouly.JPG thumb alt= upright Spiegelman married Françoise Mouly in 1977 (pictured in 2015).

Spiegelman married Françoise Mouly on July 12, 1977,{{sfn Meyers 2011}} in a City Hall ceremony.{{sfn Heer 2013 p=41}}  They remarried later in the year after Mouly Conversion to Judaism converted to Judaism to please Spiegelmans father.{{sfn Heer 2013 p=41}}  Mouly and Spiegelman have two children together: a daughter Nadja Spiegelman Nadja Rachel, born in 1987,{{sfn Meyers 2011}} and a son Dashiell Alan, born in 1992.{{sfn Meyers 2011}}

==Style==
{{Quote
 text = "All comic-strip drawings must function as diagrams, simplified picture-words that indicate more than they show."
 sign = Art Spiegelman{{sfn Cates 2010 p=96}} }}

Spiegelman suffers from a Amblyopia lazy eye, and thus lacks depth perception.  He says his art style is "really a result of [his] deficiencies".  His is a style of labored simplicity, with dense visual motifs which often go unnoticed upon first viewing.{{sfn Campbell 2008 pp=56—57}}  He sees comics as "very condensed thought structures", more akin to poetry than prose, which need careful, time-consuming planning that their seeming simplicity belies.{{sfn Campbell 2008 p=61}}Spiegelmans work prominently displays his concern with form, and pushing the boundaries of what is and is not comics.  Early in the underground comix era, Spiegelman proclaimed to Robert Crumb, "Time is an illusion that can be shattered in comics!  Showing the same scene from different angles freezes it in time by turning the page into a diagram—an orthographic projection!"{{sfn Chute 2012 p=412}}  His comics experiment with time, space, recursion, and representation.  He uses the word "decode" to express the action of reading comics{{sfn Chute 2012 pp=412–413}} and sees comics as functioning best when expressed as diagrams, icons, or symbols.{{sfn Cates 2010 p=96}}

Spiegelman has stated he does not see himself primarily as a visual artist, one who instinctively sketches or doodles.  He has said he approaches his work as a writer as he lacks confidence in his graphic skills.  He subjects his dialogue and visuals to constant revision—he reworked some dialogue balloons in Maus up to forty times.{{sfn Campbell 2008 p=57}}  A critic in The New Republic compared Spiegelmans dialogue writing to a young Philip Roth in his ability "to make the Jewish speech of several generations sound fresh and convincing".{{sfn Campbell 2008 p=57}}

Spiegelman makes use of both old- and new-fashioned tools in his work.  He prefers at times to work on paper on a drafting table, while at others he draws directly onto his computer using a digital pen and electronic drawing tablet, or mixes methods, employing scanners and printers.{{sfn Campbell 2008 p=61}}

===Influences===
File:Frans Masereel - Passionate Journey -- two pages.jpg thumb alt=Two panels from wordless novel.  On the left, a man carries a woman through the woods.  On the right, a man looks at a nude in a studio. Wordless woodcut novels such as those by Frans Masereel were an early influence.

Harvey Kurtzman has been Spiegelmans strongest influence as a cartoonist, editor, and promoter of new talent.{{sfn Zuk 2013 p=700}}  Chief among his other early cartooning influences include Will Eisner,{{sfn Frahm 2004}} John Stanley (cartoonist) John Stanleys version of Little Lulu, Winsor McCays Little Nemo, George Herrimans Krazy Kat,{{sfn Zuk 2013 p=700}} and Bernard Krigsteins short strip "Impact (EC Comics)#Master Race Master Race".{{sfn Kannenberg 2001 p=28}}

In the 1960s Spiegelman read in comics fanzines about graphic artists such as Frans Masereel, who had made wordless novels in woodcut.  The discussions in those fanzines about making the Great American Novel in comics later acted as inspiration for him.{{sfn Kaplan 2008 p=171}}  Justin Green (cartoonist) Justin Greens comic book Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary (1972) motivated Spiegelman to open up and include autobiographical elements in his comics.{{sfn Chute 2010 p=18}}

Spiegelman acknowledges Franz Kafka as an early influence,{{sfn Mulman 2010 p=86}} whom he says he has read since the age of 12,{{sfn Kannenberg 2007 p=262}} and lists Vladimir Nabokov, William Faulkner, Gertrude Stein among the writers whose work "stayed with" him.{{sfn Horowitz 1997 p=404}}  He cites non-narrative avant-garde filmmakers from whom he has drawn heavily, including Ken Jacobs, Stan Brakhage, and Ernie Gehr, and other filmmakers such as Charlie Chaplin and the makers of The Twilight Zone.{{sfn Zuk 2013 pp=699–700}}

==Beliefs==
Spiegelman is a prominent advocate for the comics medium and comics literacy.  He believes the medium echoes the way the human brain processes information.  He has toured the US with a lecture called "Comix 101", examining its history and cultural importance.{{sfn Kaplan 2006 p=123}}  He sees comics low status in the late 20th century as having come down from where it was in the 1930s and 1940s, when comics "tended to appeal to an older audience of G.I. (military) GIs and other adults".{{sfn Campbell 2008 pp=58–59}}  Following the advent of the censorious Comics Code Authority in the mid-1950s, Spiegelman sees comics potential as having stagnated until the rise of underground comix in the late 1960s.{{sfn Campbell 2008 pp=58–59}}  He taught courses in the history and aesthetics of comics at schools such as the School of Visual Arts in New York.{{sfn Witek 2007b p=xix}}  As co-editor of Raw, he helped propel the careers of younger cartoonists whom he mentored, such as Chris Ware,{{sfn Campbell 2008 p=60}} and published the work of his School of Visual Arts students, such as Kazimieras G. Prapuolenis Kaz, Drew Friedman (cartoonist) Drew Friedman, and Mark Newgarden.  Some of the work published in Raw was originally turned in as class assignments.{{sfn Kaplan 2006 p=111}}

Spiegelman has described himself politically as "firmly on the left side of the secular-fundamentalist divide" and a "First Amendment to the United States Constitution 1st Amendment absolutist".{{sfn Brean 2008}}  As a supporter of free speech Spiegelman is opposed to hate speech laws.  He wrote a critique in Harpers on the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy controversial Muhammad cartoons in the Jyllands-Posten in 2006; the issue was banned from Indigo Books and Music Indigo–Chapters stores in Canada.  Spiegelman criticized American media for refusing to reprint the cartoons they reported on at the time of the Charlie Hebdo shooting in 2015.{{sfn Brean 2015}}

Spiegelman is a non-practicing Jew and considers himself "a-Zionist"—neither pro- nor anti-Zionism Zionist; he has called Israel "a sad, failed idea".{{sfn Hays 2011}}  He told Charles Schulz he was not religious, but identified with the "alienated Jewish diaspora diaspora culture of Franz Kafka Kafka and Sigmund Freud Freud ... what Joseph Stalin Stalin pejoratively called rootless cosmopolitanism"{{sfn Mendelsohn 2003 p=180}}—a statement Ezra Mendelsohn interpreted as identification with "the Jewish spirit of universalism as championed by the greatest of Jewrys creative figures".{{sfn Mendelsohn 2003 p=180}}

==Legacy==
Maus looms large not only over Spiegelmans body of work, but over the comics medium itself.  While Spiegelman was far from the first to do autobiography in comics, critics such as James Campbell (author) James Campbell considered Maus the work that popularized it.{{sfn Campbell 2008 p=56}}  The bestseller has been widely written about in the popular press and academia—the quantity of its critical literature far outstrips that of any other work of comics.{{sfn Loman 2010 p=217}}  It has been examined from a great variety of academic viewpoints, though most often by those with little understanding of Maus{{`}} context in the history of comics.  While Maus has been credited with lifting comics from popular culture into the world of high art in the public imagination, criticism has tended to ignore its deep roots in popular culture, roots that Spiegelman has intimate familiarity with and has devoted considerable time to promote.{{sfn Loman 2010 p=212}}

Spiegelmans belief that comics are best expressed in a diagrammatic or iconic manner has had a particular influence on formalists such as Chris Ware and his former student Scott McCloud.{{sfn Cates 2010 p=96}}  In 2005, the September 11-themed New Yorker cover placed sixth on the top ten of magazine covers of the previous 40 years by the American Society of Magazine Editors.{{sfn ASME staff 2005}}  Spiegelman has inspired numerous cartoonists to take up the graphic novel as a means of expression, including Marjane Satrapi.{{sfn Zuk 2013 p=700}}

A joint ZDF–BBC documentary Art Spiegelmans Maus was televised in 1987.{{sfn Shandler 2014 p=318}}  Spiegelman, Mouly, and many of the Raw artists appeared  in the video documentary Comic Book Confidential in 1988.{{sfn Witek 2007b p=xx}}  Spiegelman played himself in the 2007 episode "Husbands and Knives" of the animated television series The Simpsons with other comics creators Daniel Clowes and Alan Moore.{{sfn Keller 2007}}  A European documentary Art Spiegelman, Traits de Mémoire appeared in 2010 and later in English under the title The Art of Spiegelman,{{sfn Shandler 2014 p=318}} directed by Clara Kuperberg and Joelle Oosterlinck and mainly featuring interviews with Spiegelman and those around him.{{sfn Kensky 2012}}
