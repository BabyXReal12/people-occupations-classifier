Reuben Garrett Lucius Goldberg (July 4, 1883 – December 7, 1970), known best as Rube Goldberg, was an American cartoonist, sculptor, author, engineer, and inventor.

Goldberg is best known for a series of popular cartoons depicting complicated gadgets that perform simple tasks in indirect, convoluted ways, giving rise to the term Rube Goldberg machines for any similar gadget or process. Goldberg received many honors in his lifetime, including a Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning Pulitzer Prize for his political cartooning in 1948 and the Banshees Silver Lady Award in 1959.<ref name="ab">{{cite web last= Goldberg   first = Reuben   title = Members / In Memoriam / Rube Goldberg   url = http://reuben.org/ncs/members/memorium/goldberg.jpg  format = JPEG  work=reuben.org  publisher=National Cartoonists Society  accessdate = August 5, 2009}}</ref>

Goldberg was a founding member and the first president of the National Cartoonists Society,<ref>[http://www.reuben.org/history.html "The History of the NCS"] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223081551/http://www.reuben.org/history.html  date=December 23, 2011 }}. reuben.org.

He is the inspiration for various international competitions, known as Rube Goldberg Machine Contests, which challenge participants to make a complicated machine to perform a simple task.

==Personal life==
Goldberg was born July 4, 1883, in San Francisco, California, to Jewish parents Max and Hannah (Cohen) Goldberg.<ref name="Cont448">{{cite book  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kHREAAAAMAAJ&q=%22rube+goldberg%22+jewish+max+hannah&dq=%22rube+goldberg%22+jewish+max+hannah&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5a-TUtXUGejKsQTK7YGoDg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ  title=Contemporary Authors: First revision, Volumes 5–8  publisher=Gale Research Company  year=1969  page=448 }}</ref> He was the third of seven children, three of whom died as children (older brother Garrett, younger brother Walter, and younger sister Lillian also survived).<ref name="marzio">{{cite book  title=Rube Goldberg: His Life and Work  first=Peter C.  last=Marzio  publisher=Harper and Row  year=1973 isbn=0060128305 }}</ref>

Goldberg began tracing illustrations when he was four years old, and first took professional drawing lessons when he was eleven.<ref name="marzio"/>

Goldberg married Irma Seeman on October 17, 1916.<ref name="Cont448"/> They lived at 98 Central Park West in New York City and had two sons named Thomas and George W. George George.

During World War II Goldbergs sons changed their surname, at Goldbergs insistence, because of the amount of hatred towards him stemming from the political nature of his cartoons.<ref>{{cite news  first=Alison J. last=Peterson  title= George W.

Thomas chose the surname of George, in order to honor his brother; George, wanting to keep a sense of family cohesiveness, adopted the same surname. Thomas and Georges children now run a company called RGI (Rube Goldberg Incorporated) to maintain the Goldberg name. John George (Thomass son) is assisted by his cousin Jennifer George<ref>{{cite web url=http://jennifergeorge-nyc.com/rube-about/  title=The Art of Rube Goldberg  publisher=Jennifer George NYC  date=  accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.rubegoldberg.com/about  first=Jennifer  last=George  title=About  publisher=Rubegoldberg.com}}</ref> (Georges daughter) and Johns son Joshua George to keep the family name alive.<ref name=bg>{{Cite news  first= Alison J.  last=Peterson  title= Obituaries – George W.

==Career==
File:Rube Goldberg & family 1929.jpg thumb 175px left Rube Goldberg with family, 1929
Goldbergs father was a San Francisco police and fire commissioner, who encouraged the young Reuben to pursue a career in engineering. Rube graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1904 with a degree in Engineering<ref name="ab" /> and was hired by the San Francisco city of San Francisco as an engineer for the Water and Sewers Department. After six months he resigned his position with the city to join the San Francisco Chronicle where he became a sports cartoonist.<ref name="ab"/> The following year, he took a job with the San Francisco Bulletin, where he remained until he moved to New York City in 1907, finding employment as a cartoonist with the New York Evening Mail.<ref name= marzio />

The New York Evening Mail was syndicated to the first newspaper syndicate, the McClure Newspaper Syndicate, giving Goldbergs cartoons a wider distribution, and by 1915 he was earning $25,000 per year and being billed by the paper as Americas most popular cartoonist.<ref name= marzio /> Arthur Brisbane had offered Goldberg $2,600 <!-- $2,600 is not a typo. The Hearst chain offer was a highly prestigious position but at a low salary, and it was later raised to $50,000 --> per year in 1911 in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to move to William Randolph Hearsts newspaper chain, and in 1915 raised the offer to $50,000 per year. Rather than lose Goldberg to Hearst, the New York Evening Mail matched the salary offer and formed the Evening Mail Syndicate to syndicate Goldbergs cartoons nationally.<ref name= marzio />

In 1916, Goldberg created a series of seven short animated films, finding humorous aspects to details of everyday life<ref>{{cite news   date=July 24, 2016   title=Goldberg is Again Star of the Film: Artist-Humorist of The Times Seen in New Set of Animated Cartoons   work=The Washington Times   page=12   url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026749/1916-07-24/ed-1/seq-12/   access-date=May 21, 2018}}</ref> in the form of an animated newsreel <ref>{{cite news   last=Photoplay Editor   date=May 5, 1916   title=Pathé Boob Weekly News from Nowhere: Goldberg Does Some Clever Satiric Cartoons on News Pictures   page=10   work=Philadelphia Evening Ledger   url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045211/1916-05-05/ed-1/seq-10/   access-date=May 21, 2018}}</ref>.

Goldberg was syndicated by the McNaught Syndicate from 1922 until 1934. 

A prolific artist, Goldberg produced several cartoon series simultaneously, including Mike and Ike (They Look Alike), Boob McNutt, Foolish Questions,<ref name="toonopediafoolishquestions">[http://toonopedia.com/foolishq.htm] at Don Marksteins Toonopedia.

==Cultural legacy==
The popularity of Goldbergs cartoons was such that the term "Goldbergian" was in use in print by 1915,<ref>{{cite book title=Oxford English Dictionary Online publisher=Oxford University Press accessdate=30 September 2016 quote=1915 Vanity Fair The Goldbergian answer would be ‘No, I paint my nose and eyes red every day to frighten the gypsy-moths away.}}</ref> and "Rube Goldberg" by 1928.<ref>{{cite news last1=Atkinson first1=J.

Rube Goldberg machine" refer to the crazy inventions for which he is now best known from his strip The Inventions of Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, drawn from 1914 to 1964.<ref name="marzio"/>{{rp 305}}

The corresponding term in the UK was, and still is, "Heath Robinson", after the English illustrator with an equal devotion to odd machinery, also portraying sequential or chain reaction elements.

In the 1962 John Wayne movie Hatari!, an invention to catch monkeys by character Pockets, played by Red Buttons, is described as a "Rube Goldberg."

In the late 1960s and early 70s, educational shows like Sesame Street, Vision On and The Electric Company routinely showed bits that involved Rube Goldberg devices, including the Rube Goldberg Alphabet Contraption, and the What Happens Next Machine.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cog2a3YeDMM  title=Sesame Street: What Happens Next Machine publisher=Youtube.com  date=August 6, 2010  accessdate=December 8, 2013}}<!-- official, not copyvio--></ref><ref>{{cite web url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B17OvPYM040  title=Rube Goldberg alphabet contraption, Sesame Street  publisher=Youtube.com  date=  accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref>

The classic video in this genre was done by the artist duo Peter Fischli & David Weiss in 1987 with their 30-minute video "Der Lauf der Dinge" or "The Way Things Go".

Honda produced a video in 2003 called "Cog (advertisement) The Cog" using many of the same principles that Fischli and Weiss had done in 1987.

The 2010 music video "This Too Shall Pass – RGM Version" by the rock band OK Go features a machine that, after four minutes of kinetic activity, shoots the band members in the face with paint. "RGM" presumably stands for Rube Goldberg Machine.<ref name="yt">{{cite web
