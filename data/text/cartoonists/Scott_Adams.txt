Scott Adams (born June 8, 1957) is the creator of the Dilbert comic strip and the author of several nonfiction works of satire, commentary, and business.

His Dilbert series came to national prominence through the downsizing period in 1990s America and was then distributed worldwide. Adams worked in various roles at big businesses before he became a full-time cartoonist in 1995. He writes in a satire satirical, often sarcasm sarcastic, way about the social and psychological landscape of white-collar workers in modern business corporations.

==Early life==
Scott Raymond Adams was born in 1957 in Windham, New York, the son of Paul and Virginia (née Vining) Adams.
He is of half-German descent,
and he also has English, Irish, Welsh, Scottish, Dutch, and "a small amount" of American Indian ancestry.
He was a fan of the Peanuts comics while growing up, and he started drawing his own comics at age six.
He won a drawing competition at age 11.
Adams graduated valedictorian at Windham-Ashland-Jewett Central School in 1975 in a class of 39. He remained in the area and received a BA in economics from Hartwick College in 1979.
He moved to California a few months after his graduation.
==Career==
===Office worker===
Adams worked closely with telecommunications engineers at Crocker National Bank in San Francisco between 1979 and 1986. Upon joining the organization, he entered a management training program after being held at gunpoint twice in four months as a Bank teller teller.
Over the years, his positions included management trainee, Programmer computer programmer, budget analyst, commercial lender, product manager, and supervisor.
He earned an Master of Business Administration MBA in economics and management from the University of California, Berkeley in 1986.
Adams created Dilbert during this period; the name came from ex-boss Mike Goodwin. Dogbert, originally named Dildog, was loosely based on his familys deceased pet beagle Lucy.
Submissions to various publications of both Dilbert and non-Dilbert comic panels failed to win publication. These included The New Yorker and Playboy. However, an inspirational letter from a fan persuaded Adams to keep trying.
He worked at Pacific Bell between 1986 and June 1995; the personalities he encountered there became the inspiration for many of his Dilbert characters.
Adams first published Dilbert with United Media in 1989, while still employed at Pacific Bell. He had to draw his cartoons at 4 a.m. in order to work a full day at the company. His first paycheck for Dilbert was a monthly royalty check of $368.62.
Gradually, Dilbert became more popular, and was published by 100 newspapers in 1991 and 400 by 1994. Adams attributes his success to his idea of including his e-mail address in the panels, thus facilitating feedback from readers.
===Full-time cartoonist===
Adamss success grew, and he became a full-time cartoonist with Dilbert in 800 newspapers. In 1996, The Dilbert Principle was released, his first business book.
Logitech CEO Pierluigi Zappacosta invited Adams to impersonate a management consultant, which he did wearing a wig and false mustache. He tricked Logitech managers into adopting a mission statement that Adams described as "so impossibly complicated that it has no real content whatsoever".
That year, he won the National Cartoonists Societys Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year and Best Newspaper Comic Strip of 1997, the most prestigious awards in the field.
In 1998, Dilbert began as a TV series, but was canceled in 2000. By 2000, the comic was in 2,000 newspapers in 57 countries and 19 languages.
{{quotation  Finally, I got the call. "Youre number one." I still havent popped the champagne. I just raise the bar for what would be the right moment, and tell myself how tasty it will be if I ever accomplish something special in my work. Apparently the thing inside me that makes me work so hard is the same thing that keeps me unsatisfied.

Adams was a fan of the science fiction TV series Babylon 5, and he appeared in the season 4 episode "Moments of Transition" as a character named "Mr. Adams" who hires former head of security Michael Garibaldi to locate his megalomaniacal dog and cat.
He also had a cameo in "NewsRadio season 3#Review Review", a third-season episode of the TV series NewsRadio, in which Matthew Brock (played by Andy Dick) becomes an obsessed Dilbert fan. Adams is credited as "Guy in line behind Dave and Joe in first scene".
Adams is the CEO of Scott Adams Foods, Inc., makers of the Dilberito and Protein Chef, and a co-owner of Staceys Café in Pleasanton, California.
==Personal life==
Adams is a member of the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences and a former member of Mensa International Mensa.
In recent years, Adams has had two notable health problems. Since late 2004, he has suffered from a reemergence of focal dystonia, which has affected his ability to draw for lengthy periods on paper,
though it causes no real problem now that he draws the comic on a graphics tablet. He also suffered from spasmodic dysphonia, a condition that causes the vocal cords to behave in an abnormal manner. He recovered from this condition temporarily, but in July 2008 underwent surgery to reroute the nerve connections to his vocal cords.
The operation was successful, and Adams voice is now completely functional.
Adams is a Vegetarianism vegetarian and trained as a Hypnosis hypnotist.
He credits his own success to Affirmations (New Age) affirmations, including Dilbert{{}}s success and achieving a ninety-fourth percentile on a difficult qualification exam for business school, among other unlikely events. He states that the affirmations give him focus.
He has described a method which he has used that he says gave him success. He pictured in his mind what he wanted, and wrote it down 15 times a day on a piece of paper.
In addition to his cartoon work, he has written two books on religion, Gods Debris (2001), and The Religion War (2004). Gods Debris lays out a theory of Pandeism, in which God blows itself up to see what will happen, which becomes the cause of our universe.
Adams married Shelly Miles in 2006. She has two children named Savannah and Justin Miles. In a February 2014 blog posting he revealed that he is no longer married.
Kristina Basham, a model and baker, is Adams girlfriend with whom he lives. She has two daughters, and is vice president of WhenHub.
Adams has often commented on political matters. Despite this, in 2016 he wrote on his blog "I dont vote and I am not a member of a political party."
In 2007, he suggested that Michael Bloomberg would make a good presidential candidate.
Before the 2008 presidential election he said, "On social issues, I lean Libertarian Party (United States) Libertarian, minus the crazy stuff",
but said in December 2011 that, if he were president, he would do whatever Bill Clinton advised him to do because that "would lead to policies that are a sensible middle ground".
In a blog post from September 2017, Adams considers himself to be "left of Bernie Sanders Bernie [Sanders], but with a preference for plans that can work."
On October 17, 2012, he wrote "while I dont agree with Mitt Romney Romneys positions on most topics, Im endorsing him for president".
===2016 United States presidential election===
In 2015, although Adams stated that he would not endorse a candidate for the United States presidential election, 2016 2016 elections, he repeatedly praised Donald Trumps persuasion skills, especially on his blog,
extensively detailing what he called Trumps "talent stack".
(Adams talent stack actually refers not to talent, but rather to skill; moreover, the talents/skills are not ordered, and so they are not a stack, but rather a set: thus, a talent stack is actually what is commonly known as a skill set.)

Adams correctly predicted Trump would win the Republican nomination and the general election;
in the 2016 election campaigns final weeks, except for a temporary reversal in early October, Adams repeatedly said Trump would win.
Adams has shared on his blog and elsewhere that men may feel emasculated by the nomination of a female candidate for president. Of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, he said the following: "If youre an undecided voter, and male, youre seeing something different. Youre seeing a celebration that your role in society is permanently diminished. And its happening in an impressive venue that was, in all likelihood, designed and built mostly by men."
Adams said that he temporarily endorsed Hillary Clinton purely out of fear for his own life, stating he had received direct and indirect death threats.
In late September, however, Adams officially switched his endorsement from Clinton to Trump. Among his primary reasons for the switch were his respect for Trumps persuasion skills over Clintons, Clintons proposal to raise the inheritance tax to 65%, and his concerns over Clintons health.
Adams states that writing about Donald Trump ended his speaking career and reduced his income by about 40%.
