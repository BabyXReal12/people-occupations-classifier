Scott Adams (born June 8, 1957) is the creator of the Dilbert comic strip and the author of several nonfiction works of satire, commentary, and business.

His Dilbert series came to national prominence through the downsizing period in 1990s America and was then distributed worldwide. Adams worked in various roles at big businesses before he became a full-time cartoonist in 1995. He writes in a satire satirical, often sarcasm sarcastic, way about the social and psychological landscape of white-collar workers in modern business corporations.

He was a fan of the Peanuts comics while growing up, and he started drawing his own comics at age six.<ref name= "2.0">{{cite book  last=Adams  first=Scott  title=Dilbert 2.0: 20 years of Dilbert  year=2008  publisher=Andrews McMeel  location=Jamaica City  isbn=0-7407-7735-1}}</ref> He won a drawing competition at age 11.<ref name="2.0" /> 

Adams graduated valedictorian at Windham-Ashland-Jewett Central School in 1975 in a class of 39. He remained in the area and received a BA in economics from Hartwick College in 1979.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://blog.dilbert.com/about  title=About Scott Adams  work=Dilbert  access-date= June 21, 2017}}</ref> He moved to California a few months after his graduation.<ref name= "2.0" />

==Career==
===Office worker===
Adams worked closely with telecommunications engineers at Crocker National Bank in San Francisco between 1979 and 1986. Upon joining the organization, he entered a management training program after being held at gunpoint twice in four months as a Bank teller teller.<ref name="2.0"/> Over the years, his positions included management trainee, Programmer computer programmer, budget analyst, commercial lender, product manager, and supervisor.<ref name="2.0"/> He earned an Master of Business Administration MBA in economics and management from the University of California, Berkeley in 1986.<ref>{{cite web  title=Scott Adams MBA 86  publisher=Haas School of Business  url=http://ewmba.haas.berkeley.edu/community/alumni/profiles/adams_scott.html   access-date=October 18, 2017}}</ref>

Adams created Dilbert during this period; the name came from ex-boss Mike Goodwin. Dogbert, originally named Dildog, was loosely based on his familys deceased pet beagle Lucy.<ref name="2.0"/> Submissions to various publications of both Dilbert and non-Dilbert comic panels failed to win publication. These included The New Yorker and Playboy. However, an inspirational letter from a fan persuaded Adams to keep trying.<ref name="2.0"/>

He worked at Pacific Bell between 1986 and June 1995; the personalities he encountered there became the inspiration for many of his Dilbert characters.<ref>{{cite news  first=André  last=Spicer  url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/23/from-inboxing-to-thought-showers-how-business-bullshit-took-over  title=From inboxing to thought showers: how business bullshit took over  newspaper=The Guardian  date=November 23, 2017 }}</ref> Adams first published Dilbert with United Media in 1989, while still employed at Pacific Bell. He had to draw his cartoons at 4&nbsp;a.m. in order to work a full day at the company. His first paycheck for Dilbert was a monthly royalty check of $368.62.<ref name="2.0"/> Gradually, Dilbert became more popular, and was published by 100 newspapers in 1991 and 400 by 1994. Adams attributes his success to his idea of including his e-mail address in the panels, thus facilitating feedback from readers.<ref name="2.0"/>

===Full-time cartoonist===
Adamss success grew, and he became a full-time cartoonist with Dilbert in 800 newspapers. In 1996, The Dilbert Principle was released, his first business book.<ref name="2.0"/>

Logitech CEO Pierluigi Zappacosta invited Adams to impersonate a management consultant, which he did wearing a wig and false mustache. He tricked Logitech managers into adopting a mission statement that Adams described as "so impossibly complicated that it has no real content whatsoever".<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www7.mercurycenter.com/archives/dilbert/mission_index.html  title=Mission: Impertinent  date=November 16, 1997  accessdate=April 14, 2014  work=San Jose Mercury News  first=Tia  last=OBrien  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817044342/http://www7.mercurycenter.com/archives/dilbert/mission_index.html  archivedate=August 17, 2000}}</ref> That year, he won the National Cartoonists Societys Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year and Best Newspaper Comic Strip of 1997, the most prestigious awards in the field.<ref name="2.0" />

In 1998, Dilbert began as a TV series, but was canceled in 2000. By 2000, the comic was in 2,000 newspapers in 57 countries and 19 languages.<ref name="2.0"/>

Adams was a fan of the science fiction TV series Babylon 5, and he appeared in the season 4 episode "Moments of Transition" as a character named "Mr. Adams" who hires former head of security Michael Garibaldi to locate his megalomaniacal dog and cat.<ref>{{IMDb title 517671 Moments of Transition}}</ref> He also had a cameo in "NewsRadio season 3#Review Review", a third-season episode of the TV series NewsRadio, in which Matthew Brock (played by Andy Dick) becomes an obsessed Dilbert fan. Adams is credited as "Guy in line behind Dave and Joe in first scene".<ref>{{IMDb title 660220 Review}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Adams is a member of the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences and a former member of Mensa International Mensa.<ref>{{cite web  last=Adams  first=Scott  title=Famous People Lists  work=Dilbert Blog  date=September 29, 2008  access-date=June 12, 2010  url=http://www.dilbert.com/blog/entry/famous_people_lists/}}</ref>

In recent years, Adams has had two notable health problems. Since late 2004, he has suffered from a reemergence of focal dystonia, which has affected his ability to draw for lengthy periods on paper,<ref>{{cite news  url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/09/AR2005050901066.html  title=Scott Adams, Drawing the Line  date=May 10, 2005  access-date=January 28, 2008  work=The Washington Post  first=Samantha  last=Sordyl}}</ref> though it causes no real problem now that he draws the comic on a graphics tablet. He also suffered from spasmodic dysphonia, a condition that causes the vocal cords to behave in an abnormal manner. He recovered from this condition temporarily, but in July 2008 underwent surgery to reroute the nerve connections to his vocal cords.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/cartoonlounge/2008/10/scott-adams-dilbert.html  work=The New Yorker  title=An Interview with the "Dilbert" Cartoonist Scott Adams  date=October 29, 2008  access-date=October 29, 2008  author=Zachary Kanin}}</ref> The operation was successful, and Adams voice is now completely functional.<ref>{{cite web  title=Dilbert creator recovers from rare disorder  url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15446515/ns/health-health_care/t/dilbert-creator-recovers-rare-disorder  publisher=MSNBC  access-date=January 7, 2016}}</ref>

Adams is a Vegetarianism vegetarian and trained as a Hypnosis hypnotist.<ref>Mentioned in Dilbert: A Treasury of Sunday Strips</ref> He credits his own success to Affirmations (New Age) affirmations, including Dilbert{{}}s success and achieving a ninety-fourth percentile on a difficult qualification exam for business school, among other unlikely events. He states that the affirmations give him focus.<ref>Mentioned in The Dilbert Future</ref> He has described a method which he has used that he says gave him success. He pictured in his mind what he wanted, and wrote it down 15 times a day on a piece of paper.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2012/04/12/can-you-get-rich-by-visualizing-yourself-rich/  title=Can You Get Rich by Visualizing Yourself Rich?  author=Robert Frank  work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> 

In addition to his cartoon work, he has written two books on religion, Gods Debris (2001), and The Religion War (2004). Gods Debris lays out a theory of Pandeism, in which God blows itself up to see what will happen, which becomes the cause of our universe.<ref>Knujon Mapson, "A Brief History of Pandeism," Pandeism: An Anthology (2017), p. 31-32.</ref> 

Adams married Shelly Miles in 2006. She has two children named Savannah and Justin Miles.

Adams has often commented on political matters. Despite this, in 2016 he wrote on his blog "I dont vote and I am not a member of a political party."<ref>{{cite web  url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/141605245101/whos-afraid-of-donald-trump  title=Whos Afraid of Donald Trump?  date=March 24, 2016  author=Scott Adams  work=Scott Adams Blog  access-date=March 26, 2016}}</ref> In 2007, he suggested that Michael Bloomberg would make a good presidential candidate.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/05/bloomberg_for_p.html  title=Bloomberg for President?  access-date=February 14, 2011  author=Scott Adams  date=May 16, 2007  work=The Dilbert Blog archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519070724/http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/05/bloomberg_for_p.html  archivedate=May 19, 2007 dead-url=no}}</ref>

Before the 2008 presidential election he said, "On social issues, I lean Libertarian Party (United States) Libertarian, minus the crazy stuff",<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/16/dilbert.economy/index.html  publisher=CNN  title=Commentary: Dilbert guys economic poll on McCain, Obama&nbsp;— CNN  date=September 16, 2008  access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref> but said in December 2011 that, if he were president, he would do whatever Bill Clinton advised him to do because that "would lead to policies that are a sensible middle ground".<ref>{{cite web  url=http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/the_persuasive_candidate  title=The Persuasive Candidate  access-date=December 6, 2011  author=Scott Adams  date=December 5, 2011  work=The Dilbert Blog archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108034509/http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/the_persuasive_candidate archive-date=January 8, 2012}}</ref> In a blog post from September 2017, Adams considers himself to be "left of Bernie Sanders Bernie [Sanders], but with a preference for plans that can work."<ref name="leftsanders">{{cite web  url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/165585434916/how-a-silicon-valley-investor-does-leadership  title=How a Silicon Valley Investor Does Leadership  work=Scott Adams Blog  date=September 21, 2017  access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref>

On October 17, 2012, he wrote "while I dont agree with Mitt Romney Romneys positions on most topics, Im endorsing him for president".<ref>{{cite web  url=http://blog.dilbert.com/2012/10/17/firing-offense/  title=Firing Offense  access-date=January 10, 2018  author=Scott Adams  date=October 17, 2012  work=The Dilbert Blog archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018111032/http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/firing_offense archive-date=October 18, 2012}}</ref>

===2016 United States presidential election===
In 2015, although Adams stated that he would not endorse a candidate for the United States presidential election, 2016 2016 elections, he repeatedly praised Donald Trumps persuasion skills, especially on his blog,<ref>{{cite web  url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/139541975641/the-trump-master-persuader-index-and-reading-list  title=The Trump Master Persuader Index and Reading List}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55NxKENplG4  title=Dilbert Creator Scott Adams on Donald Trumps "Linguistic Kill Shots"}}</ref> extensively detailing what he called Trumps "talent stack".<ref>{{cite web  title=The Trump Talent Stack  url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/153775344216/the-trump-talent-stack  website=blog.dilbert.com}}</ref> (Adams talent stack actually refers not to talent, but rather to skill; moreover, the talents/skills are not ordered, and so they are not a stack, but rather a set: thus, a talent stack is actually what is commonly known as a skill set.)

Adams correctly predicted Trump would win the Republican nomination and the general election;<ref name="trump">{{cite web last1=Suebsaeng first1=Asawin title=Dilbert Creator on How Trump Is Like The Founding Fathers & Jesus url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/14/dilbert-creator-on-how-trump-is-like-the-founding-fathers-jesus.html website=The Daily Beast date=September 14, 2015}}</ref> in the 2016 election campaigns final weeks, except for a temporary reversal in early October, Adams repeatedly said Trump would win.<ref>{{cite web title=The era of women url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/151737656851/the-era-of-women website=Scott Adams Blog date=October 13, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web title=The bully party url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/152293480726/the-bully-party website=Scott Adams Blog date=October 25, 2016 quote=Today I put Trumps odds of winning in a landslide back to 98%.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  title=The persuasion scorecard url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/152644376081/the-persuasion-scorecard-update-one-week-out  website=Scott Adams Blog date=November 2, 2016 quote=I predict Trump wins in a landslide}}</ref><ref>{{cite web title=I dont want a government job url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/152811465446/i-dont-want-a-government-job website=Scott Adams Blog date=November 6, 2016 quote=On election day, should Trump win as I predict, I ask for Trump supporters to stay cool when the predictable riots erupt.}}</ref> 

Adams has shared on his blog and elsewhere that men may feel emasculated by the nomination of a female candidate for president. Of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, he said the following: "If youre an undecided voter, and male, youre seeing something different. Youre seeing a celebration that your role in society is permanently diminished. And its happening in an impressive venue that was, in all likelihood, designed and built mostly by men."<ref>{{cite web url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/148050318231/selling-past-the-close title=Selling Past the Close – Scott Adams Blog access-date=September 13, 2016}}</ref> 

Adams said that he temporarily endorsed Hillary Clinton purely out of fear for his own life, stating he had received direct and indirect death threats.<ref name="persuasion">{{cite web url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/147247313346/when-persuasion-turns-deadly title=When Persuasion Turns Deadly}}</ref> In late September, however, Adams officially switched his endorsement from Clinton to Trump. Among his primary reasons for the switch were his respect for Trumps persuasion skills over Clintons, Clintons proposal to raise the inheritance tax to 65%, and his concerns over Clintons health.<ref>{{cite web url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/150919416661/why-i-switched-my-endorsement-from-clinton-to title=Why I Switched My Endorsement from Clinton to Trump work=Scott Adams Blog date=September 25, 2016 access-date=September 25, 2016}}</ref> Adams states that writing about Donald Trump ended his speaking career and reduced his income by about 40%.<ref name="persuasion" />
