===Career beginnings===

====Cannibal! The Musical (1992–94)====
In 1992, Stone, Parker, McHugh, and Ian Hardin founded a production company named the Avenging Conscience. The company was named after the D.W.

The quartet created a three-minute Trailer (film) trailer for a fictional film titled Alferd Packer: The Musical. The idea was based on an obsession Parker had with Alfred Packer, a real nineteenth-century prospecting prospector accused of cannibalism.<ref name=ny/> During this time, Parker had become engaged to long-time girlfriend Liaene Adamo, but their relationship fell apart shortly before production on the trailer began.<ref name=ny/> "Horribly Major depressive disorder depressed", Parker funneled his frustrations with her into the project, naming Packers "beloved but disloyal" horse after her.<ref name=ny/><ref name="cannibalSS">{{cite news url=http://splitsider.com/2011/03/cannibal-matt-stone-and-trey-parkers-original-twisted-musical/ title=Cannibal!: Matt Stone and Trey Parkers Original Twisted Musical author= Joshua Kurp  date=March 29, 2011 work=Splitsider publisher=The Awl accessdate=July 1, 2014}}</ref> The trailer became something of a sensation among students at the school, leading Virgil Grillo, the chairman and founder of the universitys film department, to convince the quartet to expand it to a feature-length film.<ref name=cannibalSS/> Parker wrote the films script, creating an Oklahoma!-style musical featuring ten original show tunes.<ref name="nonesuch"/> The group raised $125,000 from family and friends and began shooting the film.

On January 14, 2013, Stone and Parker announced that they would be starting a film production company called Important Studios.
