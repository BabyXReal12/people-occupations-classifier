DeCarlo was married, with a pregnant wife, and a laborer working for his father when he began to pursue a professional art career.<ref name=trades /> Circa 1947, answering an ad, he broke into the comic book industry at Timely Comics, the 1940s iteration of Marvel Comics. Under editor-in-chief Stan Lee, his first assignment was the teen-humor series Jeanie.<!--spelled with one "n" as per covers shown at Grand Comics Database entry at http://www.comics.org/series/505/--> DeCarlo went uncredited, as was typical for most comic-book writers and artists of the era, and he recalled in 2001, "I went on with her maybe ten books. They used to call me The Jeanie Machine because that was all Stan used to give me, was Jeanie.... Then he took me off Jeanie and he gave me Millie the Model. That was a big break for me. It wasnt doing too well and somehow when I got on it became quite successful."<ref name=trades />

He went on to an atypically long, 10-year run on that humor series, from issues #18–93 (June 1949 – Nov. 1959), most of them published by Marvels 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics (1950s) Atlas Comics.<ref name=millie>[http://www.comics.org/series/417/ Millie the Model] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> DeCarlo and Lee also took over the My Friend Irma comic strip, spun off from the hit Marie Wilson radio comedy.<ref>{{cite news  url=http://cartoonician.com/everybodys-friend-remembering-stan-lee-and-dan-decarlos-my-friend-irma/  title=Everybodys Friend: Remembering Stan Lee and Dan DeCarlo’s My Friend Irma.

He also contributed the short-lived Sherry the Showgirl and Showgirls for Atlas.<ref name=gcd>{{gcdb type=credit search=Dan+DeCarlo title=Dan DeCarlo}}</ref> In 1960, he and Atlas editor-in-chief Stan Lee co-created the short-lived print syndication syndicated comic strip Willie Lumpkin, about a suburban mail carrier,<ref>[http://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/de-carlo_dan.htm Dan DeCarlo] at the Lambiek Comiclopedia</ref> for the Chicago-based Publishers Syndicate.<ref name=trades /> A version of the character later appeared as a long-running minor supporting character in Lees later co-creation, the Marvel Comics series Fantastic Four

As well during this period, DeCarlo created and drew Standard Comics futuristic teen-humor comic book Jetta of the 21st Century. Running three issues, #5-7 (Dec. 1952 - April 1953), it featured red-haired Jetta Raye and her friends at Neutron High School.<ref name="toonopedia-jetta">[http://toonopedia.com/jetta.htm Jetta of the 21st Century] at Don Marksteins Toonopedia.

In addition to his comic-book work, DeCarlo drew freelance pieces for the magazines The Saturday Evening Post and Argosy Magazine Argosy, as well as Timely/Atlas publisher Martin Goodman (publisher) Martin Goodmans Humorama line of pin-up girl cartoon digests.<ref name=nytimes />

DeCarlo first freelanced for Archie Comics, the company with which he would become most closely associated, in the late 1950s while still freelancing for Atlas. He said in 2001,
{{quote I was looking for extra work. I went down to see Harry Shorten [at Archie] and he gave me a job. The pay wasnt too good, but I did it and he liked it – but I didnt go back right away. Finally after two or three weeks go, he called me up and wanted to know what happened, why I wasnt around. I said, Well, you know Im very busy. ... I had Millie the Model, I had My Friend Irma (radio-TV) My Friend Irma, [and] Big Boy Restaurants#Adventures_of_the_Big_Boy_comic_book Big Boy. ... I told him, The people that Im working for now let me do my own thing. But when I do work for you, its "Draw like Bob Montana." And its hard to look at your reference, and then back at your own page. Its very slow, and very tedious and I didnt like it too much. He said, Come on in, and you can draw any way you like. That made me go back with him.<ref name=trades />}}

DeCarlo is tentatively identified with Archie as early as the Jughead story "The Big Shot" in Archie Comics #48 (Feb. 1951),<ref name=gcd /> with his earliest confirmed credit the 3 3/4-page story "No Picnic" in Archies Girls Betty and Veronica #4 (undated; published in late 1951 or early to mid-1952).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/222065/ Archies Girls Betty and Veronica #4] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> His art soon established the publishers house style.<ref name=cbr>{{cite web   url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=688   title = Dan DeCarlo Dead at Age of 82: Artist Defined Archie Comics Style for Decades   publisher= Comic Book Resources   date= December 20, 2001   accessdate = March 19, 2013   archivedate = October 10, 2012   archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121010073114/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=688   deadurl = no}}</ref> As well, he is the generally recognized creator of the teen-humor characters Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Josie and the Pussycats (comics) Josie and the Pussycats, and Cheryl Blossom.<ref name=uk />

===Josie===
DeCarlo said he created Josie on his own in the late 1950s; his wife, named Josie DeCarlo Josie, said in an interview quoted in a DeCarlo obituary, "We went on a Caribbean cruise, and I had a [cat] costume for the cruise, and thats the way it started."<ref name=nytimes /> DeCarlo first tried to sell the character as a syndicated comic strip called Heres Josie, recalling in 2001:
{{quote text=When Publishers Syndicate in Chicago got interested in Willie Lumpkin ... I was also hustling my own strip and trying to get it published. Before we got to Publishers Syndicate, I went to United Media United Feature in New York City with two strips — Barneys Beat and Josie. [United Feature] told me they liked them both, and theyd like to see more samples, because I didnt bring much. I brought maybe six dailies of Barneys Beat and six dailies of Josie. That posed a problem for me. I knew I couldnt handle both strips and still keep up with the comic book work, because a syndicated bit was very risky. So, I decided to shelve Josie, and concentrated on Willie Lumpkin. [When that strip ended after] a year, maybe a year and a half[,] I quickly submitted the Josie strip back to the publishers and Harold Anderson, and he sent it back and said, Its not what were looking for, Dan, but keep up the good work, or words of that kind. Then is when I decided to take it to Archie to see if they could do it as a comic book. I showed it to Richard Goldwater, and he showed it to his father, and a day or two later I got the OK to do it as a comic book.<ref name=trades />}}

When Universal Pictures was preparing the live-action movie adaptation Josie and the Pussycats (film) Josie and the Pussycats in 2001, DeCarlo and Archie Comics became involved in a lawsuit over the characters creation, leading the publisher to terminate its 43-year relationship with him. A federal district court ruled in 2001 that Archie Comics owned the copyright to the Josie characters; this decision was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.<ref name=supreme>Dean, Mike.{{cite web url=http://www.tcj.com/aa02ws/n_decarlo.html  title="Supreme Court Rejects DeCarlo Appeal"  accessdate=December 19, 2005  deadurl=unfit  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004155455/http://www.tcj.com/aa02ws/n_decarlo.html  archivedate=October 4, 2009 }}, The Comics Journal No. 240 (January 2002), at WebCitation archive.</ref> On December 11, 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal filed by DeCarlos attorney, Whitney Seymour Jr., who had argued that the issue was a matter of state property law and not federal copyright law.<ref name=supreme />

DeCarlo was listed as a creator in the end credits of the film Josie and the Pussycats (film) Josie and the Pussycats. He received credit as co-creator of the live-action television show Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series) Sabrina the Teenage Witch.

Among DeCarlos final works were a story for Paul Dinis independent comics series Jingle Belle, and stories for Bongo Comics The Simpsons TV tie-in comic, Bart Simpson.

===Death===
DeCarlo died in New Rochelle, New York, of pneumonia.<ref name=nytimes /> Comics creator Paul Dini said upon DeCarlos death, "It was tragic that when he was at an age when many cartoonists are revered as treasures by more beneficent publishers, Dan felt spurned and slighted by the owners of properties that prospered greatly from his contributions."<ref name=cbr />

==Josie DeCarlo==
Josette Marie "Josie" DeCarlo (née Dumont; September 8, 1923 – March 14, 2012) was a France French-born Model (person) model who became the inspiration and namesake for Josie McCoy of Josie and the Pussycats (comics) Josie and the Pussycats comics and the 1970 Hanna-Barbera Josie and the Pussycats (TV series) Saturday morning cartoon series.<ref name=wrap>{{cite news first=Todd  last=Cunningham  title=Josie and the Pussycats Inspiration Josie DeCarlo Dies  url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-archie-cartoonmt1thewrap36344-20120318,0,6742034.story  work=Reuters and The Wrap  publisher=Chicago Tribune  date=2012-03-18  accessdate=2012-04-11  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321210335/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-archie-cartoonmt1thewrap36344-20120318%2C0%2C6742034.story  archivedate=March 21, 2012  df= }}</ref><ref name=bc>{{cite news first=Ethan last=Minovitz title="Josie and the Pussycats" model Josie DeCarlo dies url=http://blog.bcdb.com/josie-pussycats-model-josie-decarlo-dies-3471 work=Big Cartoon DataBase publisher=Chicago Tribune date=2012-03-16 accessdate=2012-04-11}}</ref><ref name=cp>{{cite news first=Clara last=Morris title=Josie DeCarlo, Woman Who Inspired Josie and the Pussycats, Dies url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/josie-decarlo-woman-who-inspired-josie-and-the-pussycats-dies-71655 work=The Christian Post date=2012-03-16 accessdate=2012-04-11}}</ref>

She met her future husband, Dan DeCarlo, on a blind date in Belgium in 1945, just a short time after the end of the Battle of the Bulge.<ref name=wrap/> At the time of their meeting, Dumont did not speak any English language English, while DeCarlo, a member of the U.S. Army during World War II, spoke very little French language French.<ref name=wrap/>

Unable to have a conversation due to their language barrier, Dumont and DeCarlo communicated through his cartoons. In a later interview, Josie explained their early courtship, "We communicated with drawing...He would draw things for me to make me understand what he had in mind. He was really so amusing. Instead of just using words, he would use cartoons to express himself. Right away, we knew that we were meant for each other."<ref name=wrap/>

Decarlo and Dumont married. She became the inspiration for Josie and the Pussycats almost accidentally while the couple were taking a Cruise ship cruise.<ref name=wrap/> DeCarlo wore a cat suit costume during the cruise, which became the basis for the fictional Josie and the Pussycats trademark outfits.<ref name=wrap/>

Later, when she got a new hairdo, Dan DeCarlo incorporated it into the Josie character as well, "The hairdo came after...One day, I came in with a new hairdo with a little bow in my hair, and he said, ‘That’s it!’"<ref name=wrap/> Dan DeCarlo drew his wife with the cat costume as Josie McCoy, initially giving her the name "star" before deciding on Josie.<ref name=wrap/> Josie first appeared in Archie Comics in 1962.<ref name=cp/> While DeCarlo became the model for Josie, the character was voiced by actress Janet Waldo in the Josie and the Pussycats (TV series) television series.<ref name=bc/>

Dan DeCarlo died in 2001. However, Josie DeCarlo remained active in the comic and animation industries following his death.<ref name=wrap/> She promoted her late husbands work within the industry, particularly the Josie and the Pussycats brand during the 2000s.<ref name=wrap/>

Josie DeCarlo died in her sleep on March 14, 2012, aged 88. Her funeral was held in Scarsdale, New York.<ref name=wrap/> She was predeceased by her husband and their twin sons, Dan DeCarlo Jr. and Jim DeCarlo. She was survived by two grandchildren.<ref name=bc/>

==Awards==
DeCarlo won the National Cartoonists Society Award for Best Comic Book in 2000 for Betty and Veronica Magazine Betty & Veronica. He was nominated for the Academy of Comic Book Arts Shazam Award for Best Penciller (Humor Division) in 1974.
