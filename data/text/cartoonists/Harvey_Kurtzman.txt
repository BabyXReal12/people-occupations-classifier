Harvey Kurtzman (October 3, 1924 – February 21, 1993) was an American cartoonist and editor.  His best-known work includes writing and editing the parodic comic book Mad (magazine) Mad from 1952 until 1956, and writing
<!-- is there a better word than "writing"?  The word doesnt really fit -->
the Little Annie Fanny strips in Playboy from 1962 until 1988.  His work is noted for its satire and parody of popular culture, social critique, and attention to detail.  Kurtzmans working method has been likened to that of an Auteur theory auteur, and he expected those who illustrated his stories to follow his layouts strictly.

Kurtzman began to work on the New Trend line of comic books at EC Comics  in 1950.  He wrote and edited the Two-Fisted Tales and Frontline Combat war comic books, where he also drew many of the carefully researched stories, before he created his most-remembered comic book, Mad, in 1952.  Kurtzman scripted the stories and had them drawn by top EC cartoonists, most frequently Will Elder, Wally Wood, and Jack Davis (cartoonist) Jack Davis; the early Mad was noted for its social critique and parodies of pop culture.  The comic book switched to a magazine format in 1955, and Kurtzman left it in 1956 over a dispute with ECs owner William Gaines over financial control.  Following his departure, he did a variety of cartooning work, including editing the short-lived Trump (magazine) Trump and the self-published Humbug (magazine) Humbug.  In 1959, he produced the first book-length work of original comics, the adult-oriented, satirical Harvey Kurtzmans Jungle Book Jungle Book.  He edited the low-budget Help! (magazine) Help! from 1960 to 1965, a humor magazine which featured work by future Monty Python member Terry Gilliam and the earliest work of Underground comix underground cartoonists such as Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton.  He brought Help! to an end after the success of the risqué Playboy feature Little Annie Fanny began to take up his time.  While Annie Fanny provided much of his income for the rest of his career, he continued to produce an eclectic body of work, including screenwriting the animated Mad Monster Party? in 1967 and directing, writing and designing several shorts for Sesame Street in 1969.

From 1973, Kurtzman taught cartooning at the School of Visual Arts in New York.  His work gained greater recognition toward the end of his life, and he oversaw deluxe reprintings of much of his work.  The Harvey Award was named in Kurtzmans honor in 1988.  He was inducted into the List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1989, and his work earned five positions on The Comics Journal{{`}}s Top 100 Comics of the 20th Century.

==Personal and professional history==

===Early life (1924–42)===

Harvey Kurtzman spoke little of his parents in interviews, and not much is known of their pre-American lives.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=1}}  David Kurtzman and Edith {{nee}} Sherman grew up in Ukraine in Odessa,{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=17}} and were literate urbanites.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=1}}  They belonged to the citys large Jewish community, one that suffered generations of antisemitism antisemitic oppression, and the city had fallen into economic hardship following the Russian Revolution.{{sfn Schelly 2015 pp=17–18}}  Shortly after World War I David emigrated to New York and Edith soon followed in what she called "a desperate journey" escaping the new Soviet Union.  There the non-observant pair married in a civil ceremony.{{sfn Schelly 2015 pp=18–19}}  The first of their two sons, Zachary, was born April 8, 1923.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=19}}

Harvey Kurtzman was born on October 3, 1924, in a tenement building on 428 East Ninety-Eighth Street in Brooklyn in New York City.{{sfn Schelly 2015 pp=19–20}}  David joined the Christian Science church, and when he suffered a Perforated ulcer bleeding ulcer he turned to prayer to cure it; he died from it on November 29, 1928,{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=20}} at age 36.  The family was in such desperate financial straits that their mother placed the Kurtzman brothers in an orphanage{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=1}} for three months until she secured work as a milliner.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=20}}  Several months later, Edith remarried to Russian-Jewish immigrant Abraham Perkes, who worked in the printing industry as a brass engraver.{{sfnm 1a1=Schelly 1y=2015 1pp=20–21 2a1=Kitchen 2a2=Buhle 2y=2009 2p=1}}  The Kurtzman boys kept their surname, while their mother took that of Perkes.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=21}}  The couple had a son Daniel on February 17, 1931.  In 1934, the family moved to the more upscale the Bronx Bronx,{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=25}} where the family lived at 2166 Clinton Avenue.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=2}}

Perkes was not wealthy, but managed to provide for his family during the Great Depression of the 1930s.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=22}}  He was a trade unionist, and the couple read the communist newspaper Daily Worker.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=3}}
<!-- After the marriage, the couple were able to bring the brothers home.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=1}} *** Schellys book seems to contradict this *** -->
Perkes brought young Kurtzman to work, and encouraged him to help with design and drawing and to think of himself as a professional artist.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=2}}

Though he was a shy boy{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=22}} his teachers recognized Kurtzmans intelligence in Primary school grade school and allowed him to Grade skipping skip a grade.  He displayed artistic talent early{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=3}} and his sidewalk chalk drawings drew the attention of children and adults, who gathered around to watch him draw.  He called these strips "Ikey and Mikey", inspired by Rube Goldberg Goldbergs comic strip Mike and Ike (They Look Alike) Mike and Ike.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 pp=3, 8, 10}}  His stepfather also had an interest in art and took the boys to museums.  His mother encouraged his artistic development and enrolled him in art lessons;{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=19}} on Saturdays, he took the subway to Manhattan for formal art instruction.  His parents had him attend the left-leaning Jewish Camp Kinderland, but he did not enjoy its dogmatic atmosphere.  Though not ashamed of their Jewish heritage, neither of the Kurtzman brothers agreed to have a Bar and Bat Mitzvah Bar Mitzvah.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=3}}

Kurtzman fell in love with comic strips and the newly emerging comic books in the late 1930s.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=8}}  Unsatisfied with what he found in his parents newspapers, he searched through garbage cans for the Sunday strip Sunday comics sections of his neighbors newspapers.  He admired a wide variety of strips, including V. T. Hamlin Hamlins Alley Oop,{{sfn Schelly 2015 pp=22–23}} Milton Caniff Caniffs Terry and the Pirates (comic strip) Terry and the Pirates, Chester Gould Goulds Dick Tracy, Hal Foster Fosters Prince Valiant, Alex Raymond Raymonds Flash Gordon, and Al Capp Capps Lil Abner.  He found Will Eisners comic book Spirit (comics) The Spirit a "standard by which other comic books would be measured",{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=8}} and called Eisner "the greatest ... a virtuoso cartoonist of a kind who had never been seen before".{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=8}}  Eisners page layouts had considerable influence on Kurtzmans work.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=8}}

At 14 Kurtzman won a cartooning contest for which he received a dollar and had his cartoon published in Tip Top Comics {{No.}}36 (April 1939).  Future collaborator Jack Davis (cartoonist) Jack Davis had won the same contest a few issues earlier.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 pp=5, 8}}  After winning the annual John Wanamaker Art Contest, Kurtzman received a scholarship to attend high school at The High School of Music &amp; Art.{{sfn Comics Journal staff 1993 p=5}}  Future colleagues Will Elder, Al Feldstein, Al Jaffee, John Severin, and Charles Stern  also attended the school.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=5}}  Kurtzman graduated at 16 in 1941 and went on to Cooper Union on a scholarship.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=10}}  Kurtzman left after a year to focus on making comic books.{{sfn Harvey 2000 p=97}}

===Early career (1942–49)===

File:CC No 05 Moby Dick.JPG thumb alt=Comic book cover.  Whalers attack a whale. Kurtzman assisted on the Classics Illustrated version of Moby-Dick Moby Dick in 1942 as his first assignment at Louis Ferstadts studio.

Kurtzman met Alfred Andriola in 1942, encouraged by a quote in Martin Sheridans Classic Comics and their Creators where Andriola offered help to aspiring cartoonists.  Kurtzman made an appointment, but Andriolas response to his work was discouraging—he told Kurtzman to give up on cartooning.  Kurtzman called this meeting "one of the worst days of {{interp his original=my}} life", though he ignored Andriolas advice and continued to peddle his portfolio.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 pp=10, 12}}

Kurtzman continued to do odd jobs in 1942 until he got his first break in the comics industry at Louis Ferstadts studio, which produced comics for Quality Comics Quality, Ace Comics (publishers) Ace, Gilberton (publisher) Gilberton,{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=12}} and the Daily Worker.{{sfn Kercher 2006 p=104}}  His first published work there was assisting on issue #5 (September 1942){{efn The artwork for the issue was penciled by Louis Zansky and inked by Fred Eng.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=59}} }} of Gilbertons Classics Illustrated Classic Comics, which features an adaptation of Moby Dick.  His first pencil job appeared in Four Favorites #8 (December 1942).{{efn Credited to "Kurtzman with Looey", suggesting Ferstadt handled the inking.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=59}} }}{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=59}}  He produced a large amount of undistinguished work in 1942 and 1943, which he later called "very crude, very ugly stuff",{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=13}} before he was Conscription drafted in 1943 for service in World War II.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=13}}

Kurtzman trained for the infantry, but was never sent overseas.  He was stationed in Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas.  He illustrated instruction manuals, posters, and flyers, and contributed cartoons to camp newspapers, and newsletters.  While there, he was invited by publisher and cartoonist L. B. Cole to draw the "Black Venus" superheroine, packaged for publisher Rae Hermans Orbit Publications.  In 1944, he did work for several local publications while stationed in North Carolina, and had several gag cartoons in Yank, the Army Weekly Yank by the end of October 1945.  The quantity of work allowed Kurtzman to hone his style, which became more refined and distinct.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 pp=13–14}}

After his discharge following the war, Kurtzman found competition fierce in the comics industry, as Freelancer freelancing replaced the system of packaging shops.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=18}}  He applied to the newspaper PM (newspaper) PM, but his portfolio was rejected by cartoon editor Walt Kelly.{{sfn Kercher 2006 p=105}}  After a series of short-lived assignments and partnerships, Kurtzman got together with former Music and Art alumni Will Elder{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=18}} and Charles Stern.  They opened Charles William Harvey Studio in 1947, but had difficulty getting work.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=18}}  The three had little business sense.  Kurtzman managed the bills.  In their Broadway studio, which Kurtzman kept open until the end of 1951, they Lease#Sublease sublet space to cartoonists such as John Severin, Dave Berg (cartoonist) Dave Berg,{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=21}} and René Goscinny.{{sfnm 1a1=Kitchen 1a2=Buhle 1y=2009 1p=21 2a1=Harvey 2y=2000 2p=97}}

Kurtzman had been doing Crossword crossword puzzles for publisher Martin Goodman (publisher) Martin Goodman since early in his career.  A distant relative of Goodmans, Stan Lee, worked as an editor for Goodmans Timely Comics (a precursor to Marvel Comics).  He offered Kurtzman work doing one-page fillers, work that paid little.  Lee named the strip Hey Look!,{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=22}} and Kurtzman produced 150 episodes of it from 1946 until 1949.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=23}}

At an Art and Music reunion in early 1946 Kurtzman met Adele Hasan, who was one of only two female staff members at Timely and was dating Will Elder.  She fell for Kurtzman, confiding to Al Jaffee that he "was the kind of kind {{interp she would original=Id}} like to marry".{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=30}}  Later in the year, Timely ran a "Now You Can Be the Editor!" contest whose ballots Hasan was assigned to sort through.  She was disappointed that readers did not enjoy Kurtzmans Hey Look! as much as she did.  She "stuffed the ballot box"{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=30}} in Kurtzmans favor, which prompted an astonished Stan Lee to assign Kurtzman more work.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=30}}  Kurtzman was given the funny animal feature Pigtales at regular freelance rates, as well as miscellaneous other assignments.  As Harvey stopped by the Timely offices more frequently, he and Adele would flirt, and eventually started dating.  She left Timely for college that autumn, and corresponded frequently with Kurtzman;{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=38}} soon she dropped out of college and the two married that September.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=38}}

In 1948 Kurtzman produced a Sunday comic strip, Silver Linings, which ran infrequently in the New York Herald Tribune between March and June.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=40}}  Lee had Hey Look! brought to an end in 1949 so Kurtzman could concentrate on longer features for Timelys family-oriented line.  Kurtzman was assigned artwork duties for the Lee-scripted Rusty, an imitation of Chic Youngs comic strip Blondie (comic strip) Blondie, but was disappointed with this type of work and began looking for other employment.  He sold episodes of the one-pagers Egghead Doodle and Genius to Timely and Al Capps Toby Press on a freelance basis.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=40}}  He also sold longer pieces to Toby, including episodes of his Western parody Pot Shot Pete, a short-lived series that hinted at the pop-culture satire Kurtzman was to become known for.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=41}}

Kurtzman came across Charles Biros Crime Does Not Pay (comics) Crime Does Not Pay, a comic book Kurtzman describes as reading with "the same excitement ... that {{interp he original=I}} felt about the underground comic books of twenty years later".  These stories presented a view of reality quite different from the escapist entertainment typical of comics of the day, and was to influence the war and social drama work Kurtzman was soon to do at EC Comics.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=41}}

===EC and Mad (1949–56)===

{{See also Harvey Kurtzmans editorship of Mad}}

Kurtzman continued to shop his work around, and produced work for Ace/Periodical, Quality, Aviation Press, Timely, and the magazines Varsity and Parents (magazine) Parents.  He did a number of childrens books, four of which were collaborations with René Goscinny.  He brought some samples of educational comics into the EC Comics offices—"EC" had originally stood for "Educational Comics" when it was run by Max Gaines,{{sfn Jacobs 1972 p=81}} but his son William Gaines Bill changed the companys focus and name to "Entertaining Comics" when he inherited the business.  Gaines liked Kurtzmans Hey Look! samples but had no immediate use for his particular skills.  Gaines directed Kurtzman to his brother, David, who gave him some low-paying work on Lucky Fights it Through, a two-fisted cowboy story with an educational health message about syphilis.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=47}}

File:Eclogo.jpeg thumb left alt=Circular logo with "EC" in the center, surround by the words "An Entertaining Comic" Kurtzman worked for EC Comics from 1950 to 1956.

With the doors to EC open to him Kurtzman started getting regular work from the publisher in 1950.  That spring, ECs "New Trend" line of horror, fantasy, and science fiction comics began, and Kurtzman contributed stories in these genres.  His income doubled over the previous years.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=50}}  In late 1950, he began writing and editing an adventure title, Two-Fisted Tales, which he proposed as a comic book in the vein of Roy Cranes popular comic strip, Captain Easy.  The comic book differed in offering realistic stories in place of Cranes idealism, a degree of realism not yet seen in American comics.  The war stories of Frontline Combat followed in mid-1951.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=59}}  The stories were not only about modern war, but also derived from deep in history, such as the Roman legions and Napoleonic Wars Napoleonic campaigns.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=61}}  Kurtzman rejected the idealization of war that had swept the US since World War II.  He spent hours in the New York Public Library in search of the detailed truth behind the stories he was writing,{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=60}} sometimes taking days or weeks to research a story.{{sfn Harvey 1996 p=129}}  His research included interviewing and corresponding with G.I. (military) GIs{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=66}} taking a ride aboard a rescue plane, and sending his assistant Jerry DeFuccio for a ride in a submarine to gather sound effects.{{sfn Reidelbach 1991 p=16}}  The stories gave a sympathetic look to both sides of a conflict, regardless of nationality or ethnicity.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=62}}  He sought to tell what he saw as the objective truth about war, deglamorizing it and showing its futility, though the stories were not explicitly anti-war.{{sfn Harvey 1996 p=135}}

Kurtzman was given a great deal of artistic freedom by Gaines, but was himself a strict taskmaster.  He insisted that the artists who drew his stories not deviate from his layouts.  The artists generally respected Kurtzmans wishes out of respect for his creative authority, but some, like Bernard Krigstein Bernie Krigstein{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=60}} and Dan Barry (cartoonist) Dan Barry,{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=63}} felt their own artistic autonomy impinged upon.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=60}}

The father says, "That thing!  That slithering blob coming toward us!"  The mother says, "What is it?"  The child, says, "Its Melvin!" Kurtzman is best known for creating Mad (magazine) Mad in 1952.

Those who worked for EC received payment based on output.  Kurtzmans laborious working methods meant he was less prolific than fellow EC writer and editor Al Feldstein, and Kurtzman felt financially underappreciated for the amount of effort he poured into his work.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=67}}  He was financially burdened with a mortgage and a family.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=82–83}}  He also detested the horror content of the books Feldstein was producing, and which consistently outsold his own work.  He believed these stories had the same sort of influence on children that the chauvinism of war comics which he believed he worked hard against in his own work.{{sfn Wright 2003 p=152}}  Remembering Kurtzmans humor work from the 1940s,{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=67}} Gaines proposed a humor magazine to increase Kurtzmans income,{{sfn Harvey 1996 p=136}} as he believed it would take far less time and effort to research.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=82–83}}  Mad (magazine) Mad debuted in August 1952,{{efn The October–November cover-dated first issue of Mad appeared on newsstands in August 1952.{{sfn Harvey 1996 p=136}} }} and Kurtzman scripted every story in the first twenty-three issues.  The stories in Mad targeted what Kurtzman saw as fundamental untruths in the subjects parodied, inspired by the irreverent humor found in college humor magazines.  They were developed in the same incremental way Kurtzman had developed for the war stories, and his layouts were followed faithfully by the artists who drew them—most frequently, Will Elder, Jack Davis and Wally Wood.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=83}}

Mad did not have instant success, but found its audience by the fourth issue, which quickly sold out.  The issue featured the Wood-drawn "Superduperman", a parody of Superman and Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Captain Marvel, including the National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications copyright infringement lawsuit that National Periodicals (now DC Comics) had recently brought against Fawcett Comics.{{sfnm 1a1=Markstein 1y=2010b 2a1=Wright 2y=2003 2p=147}}  National, the owners of Supermans copyright, threatened to file another lawsuit over the parody.  EC and National shared the same lawyer, who advised Gaines to quit publishing parodies.  While Gaines was weighing this advice, Kurtzman discovered a legal precedent that backed Mad{{}}s right to parody.  Gaines hired the author of that precedent to write a brief substantiating ECs position, but the lawyer sided with National.  Gaines consulted a third lawyer, who advised Gaines to ignore the threat and continue publishing parodies.  National never filed suit.{{sfn Reidelbach 1991 p=23}} When Kurtzman parodied Nationals Batman character just four issues later, the spoof included six separate picket signs, posters and other notices proclaiming that "Batboy and Rubin" was a comedic imitation (e.g. "Not a spittoon, not a cartoon, not a harpoon, but a LAMPOON!")

Parodying specific targets became a staple of Mad.{{sfn Kercher 2006 pp=106–107}}  Beginning April 1954, the bimonthly Mad went monthly after the cancelation of Frontline Combat, whose sales had flagged when the Korean War ended.{{sfn Harvey 2000 p=101}}  Soon, large numbers of Mad imitators sprang up from other publishers, as well as from EC itself with the Feldstein-edited Panic (comics) Panic.{{sfn Harvey 2000 p=100}}

Kurtzman dreamed up a full-color, 100-page adaptation of Charles Dickens Dickens A Christmas Carol called Marleys Ghost in 1954, and proposed the project to Simon &amp; Schuster and other publishers.  The proposal included seven finished pages,{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=160}} as well as a page redone by Jack Davis in case publishers rejections were over Kurtzmans drawing style.{{sfnm 1a1=Kitchen 1a2=Buhle 1y=2009 1p=160 2a1=Hignite 2y=2007 2p=45}}  The ambitious project did not find a willing publisher, as comics were still seen as too low-brow for such lavish treatment.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=160}}

Since the 1940s, Crime comics crime and horror comics had been drawing fire from those worried about a rise in juvenile delinquency.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=}}{{page needed date=October 2012}}  The United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency brought pressure on such comic books in 1954, and EC, one of the major purveyors of such fare, found their wares being refused by their distributor.  Gaines brought those titles to an end and tried to replace them with the List of Entertaining Comics publications#New Direction New Direction line, but by autumn 1955 the only remaining EC title was Mad,{{sfn Harvey 1996 p=138}} which that July had changed to a magazine format.  Gaines had allowed Kurtzman to change Mad{{}}s format in order to keep him at EC after Kurtzman had received an offer of employment from Pageant (magazine) Pageant magazine.{{sfn Harvey 2000 p=101}}

File:Alfred E. Neumann.jpg alt=Color poster illustration of a boy with a goofy grin, captioned "Me Worry?" left thumb Kurtzman Appropriation (art) appropriated the "Me Worry?" character as Mad (magazine) Mad{{}}s mascot, Alfred E. Neuman.

Kurtzman poured himself into Mad, putting as much effort into it as he had into his war books.  This defeated the purpose of having an easy-to-produce third book, but with Frontline Combat{{`}}s cancelation, Kurtzman focused on Mad.{{sfn Harvey 1996 p=138}}  Kurtzman had long dreamed of joining the slick magazine publishing world, and had been trying to convince Gaines to publish Mad in a magazine format.  The August issue of Pageant featured an article "Now Comics Have Gone Mad", and Pageant{{}}s publisher Hillman Periodicals#Alex L. Hillman Alex Hillman offered him a job.  With the prospect of losing Kurtzman, Gaines gave in to Kurtzmans demands.  The magazine-format twenty-fourth issue of Mad (July 1955) was more successful than anticipated, and had to be reprinted, an unusual occurrence in magazine publishing.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=77}}  The new format was ambitious, and included meticulously rendered advertisement parodies and text pieces by humorists such as Ernie Kovacs, Stan Freberg, and Steve Allen.  It was around this time that Kurtzman introduced Mad{{}}s gap-toothed mascot and his slogan, "What, me worry?",{{sfn Kercher 2006 p=114}} whom Feldstein later named Alfred E. Neuman.{{sfn Kaplan 2008 p=78}}

During the early 1950s, Kurtzman became one of the writers for Dan Barrys relaunched Flash Gordon daily comic strip.  He scripted two sequences for the strip,
<!-- the first from December 31, 1952 to April 20, 1953, Shelleys book contradicts these dates -->
with portions pencilled by Frank Frazetta.{{sfn Norwood 1983 p=7}}  The strip soon became one of Mad{{}}s targets in "Flesh Garden!", drawn by Wood, who had earlier assisted Barry on the Flash Gordon strip.{{sfn Stewart 2016 p=191}}

The one-time cartoonist Hugh Hefner had become a media mogul by the mid-1950s with his Playboy magazine.  He had admired Kurtzmans Mad, and met Kurtman in New York to express his appreciation.  He told Kurtzman that if he ever left Mad, he would have a place in the Hefner empire.  With this promise to back him, Kurtzman demanded legal control of Mad from Gaines in the form of stocks.  Reluctant to lose the editor of his sole remaining publication, Gaines offered a 10% share.  As this would not give Kurtzman the control he wanted, Kurtzman countered with a demand for 51%.  Gaines refused, and the two parted ways.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=121}}  Kurtzman contacted Hefner{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=122}} and Gaines hired Al Feldstein to edit Mad.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=109}}

===Trump, Humbug and Jungle Book (1957–59)===

{{Quote

File:Playboy-logo.jpg alt= right thumb With Trump (magazine) Trump (1957), Kurtzman began a long relation with Hugh Hefner and Playboy.

Hefner employed Kurtzman from April 1956.  The slick, full-color Trump (magazine) Trump appeared on newsstands in January 1957.  Cartoonists who contributed to Trump included Mad regulars such as Elder, Wood, Davis, Jaffee, and Heath, as well as newer artists such as Irving Geis, Arnold Roth, and R. O. Blechman.  Writers Mel Brooks, Roger Price (comedian) Roger Price, Doodles Weaver, and Max Shulman also made contributions.  The fifty-cent magazine was a luxurious, more risqué version of Mad, and sold well.  Unfortunately, Hefner began to have financial problems, and canceled Trump after its second issue.  The magazine had been a success in the market, but had already accrued $100,000 in expenses, to which Hefner quipped, "I gave Harvey Kurtzman an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it."{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 pp=122–123}}

Hefner delivered the news in person to Kurtzman—in the hospital where his third child, Elizabeth, was being born.  Adele said it was the only time she had seen her husband cry.  Kurtzman later said that Trump was the closest he ever came to producing "the perfect humor magazine".{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=125}}

While the Trump artists were mulling over the situation in the Playboy offices, Roth approached with a bottle of scotch.  By the time they left the office, the group had agreed to embark on a publishing venture of their own: Humbug (magazine) Humbug.  The publication was financed and run by the artists who created it,{{sfn Benson Groth 2009 p=viii}} though none of the group had business experience.  With Kurtzman in the lead the reinvigorated, close-knit group set out to produce a classy publication in the vein of college humor magazines, but aimed at a general readership.{{sfn Benson Groth 2009 p=xi}}  Along with the pop-cultural satire that had been the staple of Mad and Trump, Humbug included more topical and political satire, mostly from writers other than Kurtzman.{{sfn Benson Groth 2009 p=xiv}}  Hefner provideded the group free office space out of guilt for canceling Trump so quickly.{{sfn Benson Groth 2009 p=x}}

Humbug ran into snags right away due to its small format, which made it difficult for consumers to find it on the newsstands.{{sfn Benson Groth 2009 p=xi}}  It also suffered distribution problems.{{sfnm 1a1=Benson 1a2=Groth 1y=2009 1p=xii 2a1=Genzlinger 2y=2008}}  For its last two issues, Humbug was printed in a standard magazine size, and the price was raised from fifteen cents to twenty-five.  At the last minute, the page count of the eleventh issue was increased from thirty-two pages to forty-eight, reprinting material from Trump.  This last issue included a self-deprecating message from Kurtzman which summarized the artists careers and announced Humbug{{}}s farewell.  The group followed divergent career paths following the breakup.{{sfn Benson Groth 2009 p=xv}}

After the demise of Humbug, Kurtzman spent a few years as a freelance contributor to magazines such as Playboy, Esquire (magazine) Esquire, Madison Avenue, The Saturday Evening Post, TV Guide, and Pageant (magazine) Pageant.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=60}}  With Elliot Caplin he produced a poorly received comic strip, Kermit the Hermit, among other miscellaneous work.{{sfnm 1a1=Kitchen 1a2=Buhle 1y=2009 1p=60 2a1=Comics Journal staff 2y=1993 2p=13}}  In 1958 Kurtzman proposed a strip to TV Guide parodying adult Western TV shows; its rejection particularly disappointed him.{{sfn Kitchen 2014 p=22}}

In 1959, Ballantine Books was looking for something to replace its successful line of Mad mass-market paperback reprints after Gaines had taken it to another publisher.{{sfn Spiegelman 1988 p=vii}}  Ballantine had earlier published The Humbug Digest in the same format,{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=151}} though it fared poorly in the market.{{sfn Kitchen 2014 p=15}}  Kurtzman proposed a book of original material designed for the format,{{sfn Spiegelman 1988 p=vii}} which Ian Ballantine, with reservations, accepted on faith out of respect for Kurtzman.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=151}}  Harvey Kurtzmans Jungle Book was the first mass-market paperback of original comics content in the United States,{{sfnm 1a1=Corliss 1y=2004 1p=4 2a1=Kitchen 2a2=Buhle 2y=2009 2p=151}} and to Kurtzman biographer Denis Kitchen was a precursor to the graphic novel.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=151}}  Whereas his Mad stories had been aimed at an adolescent audience, Kurtzman made Jungle Book for adults, which was unusual in American comics.{{sfn Spiegelman 1988 p=vii}}  Jungle Book sold poorly, but remained a favorite among its small number of devoted fans.{{sfn Groth 2006 p=127}}  If it had been a success, Kurtzman intended to continue with more books in the same vein.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 pp=150–151, 153}}

===Help! and Little Annie Fanny (1960–65)===

Kurtzman had "The Grasshopper and the Ant" printed in Esquire (magazine) Esquire magazine in 1960.  The strip was a social allegory of a Hipster (1940s subculture) hipster grasshopper and a hard-working ant with opposing worldviews, both of whom lose out in the end.  It was a rarity for Kurtzman in that he created it in full color, rather in black-and-white lineart with color added afterward.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=160}}  Kurtzman once more proposed Marleys Ghost to a number of publishers in 1962, including The Saturday Evening Post, but again it was rejected.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=160}}

In 1960, Harvey teamed up with publisher James Warren (publisher) James Warren to co-publish Help!.  Warren Publishing ran the business end, while co-ownership of the magazine allowed Kurtzman the control that he wanted, though its tight budget restricted that control.  The magazine made frequent use of Photonovel#fumetti fumetti photographic comics, which sometimes starred celebrities{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=188}} such as Woody Allen and a pre-Monty Python John Cleese.  The first issue was cover-dated August 1960.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=188}}  Gloria Steinem and Terry Gilliam were among those the magazine employed.{{sfnm 1a1=Gabilliet 1y=2010 1p=62 2a1=Green 2y=2010 2p=548}}  By the end of its run, Help! had introduced a number of young cartoonists who were to play a major part in the {{not a typo underground comix}} movement, including Robert Crumb, Jay Lynch, Gilbert Shelton, Spain Rodriguez, and Skip Williamson.{{sfn Comics Journal staff 1993 p=14}}

File:Goodman Goes Playboy page 2 panel 3.jpg thumb left alt=Comic strip panel The parodic depictions of Archie Comics characters in "Goodman Beaver#"Goodman Goes Playboy" Goodman Goes Playboy" prompted a copyright infringement lawsuit.

Help!{{}}s most famous story{{sfn Edison 2011 p=86}} starred Kurtzmans character Goodman Beaver in "Goodman Goes Playboy" in the February 1962 issue.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=185}}{{efn The February 1962 issue of Help! appeared in late 1961.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=204}} }}  The story satirized Hefner and his lifestyle, while parodying Archie Comics Archie comics in a much more risqué way than the previous "Starchie" parody in Mad had.  The Archie characters were drinking, partying skirt-chasers home from college.  Archie{{}}s publishers sued, and Warren agreed to settle out of court rather than risk an expensive lawsuit.  The actual target of the strip had however been Hefner, who loved it; Kurtzman began working for Hefner again soon after.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=204}}

Kurtzman approached Hefner in 1960 with the idea of a comic strip feature for Playboy that would star Goodman Beaver.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=210}}  Playboy ran a lot of cartoons, but a comic strip was something new to the magazine.  After discussing ideas, Kurtzmans proposal was accepted under the condition that Goodman Beaver be transformed into a voluptuous female.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=211}}  Little Annie Fanny was Playboy{{s}} first comic strip and the first multi-page comics feature in an American Slick (magazine format) slick magazine.{{sfn Markstein 2001}}  As his primary collaborator, Kurtzman had Will Elder{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=211}} provide the strips labor-intensive, fully painted full-color final rendering.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 pp=211–212}}  Little Annie Fanny began appearing in Playboy in 1962.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=219}}

Kurtzman and Warren disagreed on Kurtzmans editorial decisions on Help!,{{sfn Cooke Roach 2001 p=26}} and Kurtzman found himself unsatisfied with the partnership.  Help!{{}}s sales were declining, and the magazine quietly came to an end with its twenty-sixth issue, cover-dated September 1965.  This allowed Kurtzman and Elder to focus full-time on Little Annie Fanny.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 pp=204, 219}}   Hefner was a demanding editor and delivered critiques to Kurtzman that could reach twenty pages.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=215}}

===Later years (1965–93)===

Kurtzman participated in a number of film projects beginning in the late 1960s.  He co-scripted the stop-motion animated film Mad Monster Party? (1967), a job he got through the recommendation of Jack Davis, who had been doing character designs for the films production company Rankin/Bass Productions Rankin/Bass.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=450, 452}}  Kurtzman wrote, co-directed, and designed several short animated pieces for Sesame Street in 1969; he was particularly proud of the Phil Kimmelman-animated Boat, in which a left prosthetic-legged sea captain voiced by Hal Smith (actor) Hal Smith orders a series of increasingly larger numerals to load into a boat, eventually sinking it.  In 1972, he appeared in a television advertisement for Scripto pens.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=223}}

Kurtzman turned down a number of well-paying opportunities in the 1970s.  In early 1972, Stan Lee offered Kurtzman a senior position at Marvel Comics, and proposed another Mad-like magazine; Kurtzman turned these opportunities down, as he felt unprepared to return to the comic book industry after being out of it for so long since leaving EC.{{sfnm 1a1=Wochner 1y=1985 1p=115 2a1=Schelly 2y=2015 2p=494}}  Marvel launched Crazy Magazine without him in 1973.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=494}}  Michael C. Gross asked him to contribute to National Lampoon (magazine) National Lampoon around this time.  The magazines staff revered Kurtzman and had published a parody of Mad in 1971 that included "Citizen Gaines", a piece critical of Gaines handling of Mad and treatment of Kurtzman.  Kurtzman turned the offer down, as he felt out of step with the younger cartoonists approach.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=495}}  He turned down an offer from René Goscinny in 1973 to act as the US agent for the French comics magazine Pilote.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=496}}

File:SVA MainBuilding.jpg thumb right alt=Photograph of School of Visual Arts Main Building Kurtzman taught at the School of Visual Arts in the 1970s.

In 1973, New Yorks School of Visual Arts asked Kurtzman and Will Eisner to take teaching positions there in cartooning.  Kurtzman had no earlier teaching experience and found the prospect daunting,{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=516}} but Eisner convinced him to take the job.  Eisners class was called "Sequential Art" and Kurtzmans was "Satirical Cartooning",{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=517}} which focused on single-panel gag cartooning.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=518}}  Kurtzman had a soft touch with his students, and was well respected and well liked.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=519}}  He frequently had professional cartoonists appear as guest lecturers.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=520}}  When the school refused to publish his students work, Kurtzman had them published in an ad-supported, student-produced anthology that came to be called Kar-Tünz.{{efn The first edition of Kar-Tünz was titled Harvey Kurtzmans class of 73–74, School of Visual Arts.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=520}} }}{{sfn Schelly 2015 pp=520–522}}  Kar-Tünz ran for fifteen years.{{sfn Comics Journal staff 1993 p=17}}

Beginning in the late 1970s, Kurtzmans stature began to grow.  His protégés such as Crumb, Spiegelman and Gilliam sang his praises, his reputation grew with the spread of comics fandom,{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=224}} and collector Glenn Bray published The Illustrated Harvey Kurtzman Index in 1976.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=233}}  He also found he had a following in Europe; his appeared there for there for the first time in the French magazine Charlie Mensuel in October 1970, and in 1973 the European Academy of Comic Book Art awarded him its Lifetime Achievement Award for 1972.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=496}}  A series of reprint projects and one-shot efforts appeared in the 1970s and 1980s, including Kurtzman Komix, published in 1976 by Kitchen Sink Press.  In his later years, Kurtzman continued to work on anthologies and various other projects.{{citation needed date=November 2012}}  He oversaw{{sfn Comics Journal staff 1993 p=17}} reprints of his work in deluxe editions from Russ Cochran (publisher) Russ Cochran, who did The Complete EC Library, and Kitchen Sink Press, who did collections of Goodman Beaver (1984), Hey Look! (1992), and others, and reprinted Harvey Kurtzmans Jungle Book (1988).  Lengthy interviews were conducted with The Comics Journal and Squa Tront.  The comics industrys Harvey Award was named in his honor in 1988.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=224}}  Kurtzman toured and gave speeches frequently to fans in the 1980s.{{sfn Hill 2013 pp=429, 432}}

Kurtzman had reconciled with Gaines by the mid-1980s, and contributed some pieces to Mad with art by Elder.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=223}}  Kurtzman brought Little Annie Fanny to an end in 1988, amid failing health, a poor relationship with Playboy cartoon editor Michelle Urry, and resentment over the discovery that he did not own the rights to the strip.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=215}}  Harvey Kurtzmans Strange Adventures assembled a wide cast of cartoonists in 1990 to illustrate stories from Kurtzmans layouts, though the book was not a success, nor was a revival of Two-Fisted Tales.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=223}}  He had long planned to write a comics history, but other work had taken priority.  Towards the end of his life, he agreed to collaborate with comics historian Michael Barrier (historian) Michael Barrier to complete From Aargh! to Zap! Harvey Kurtzmans Visual History of the Comics, which was published in 1991, though it was shorter than the more complete history Kurtzman had planned.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=236}}

Kurtzman, who had suffered from Parkinsons disease{{sfnm 1a1=Kitchen 1a2=Buhle 1y=2009 1p=236 2a1=Comics Journal staff 2y=1993 2p=5}} and colon cancer in later life,{{sfn Comics Journal staff 1993 p=5}} died at Mount Vernon, New York on February 21, 1993, of complications from liver cancer,{{sfnm 1a1=Comics Journal staff 1y=1993 1p=5 2a1=Corliss 2y=2004}} nine months after Bill Gaines death.  The New Yorker commissioned a commemorative cartoon by Will Elder and ran an elegy by writer Adam Gopnik.{{sfn Corliss 2004}}  Cartoonist Jules Feiffer remarked at the time that cartooning had lost its Orson Welles.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=224}}

==Personal life==

Kurtzman stood {{convert 5 ft 6 in cm}} and was of slight build.  He had an unassuming demeanor; humorist Roger Price (comedian) Roger Price likened him to "a beagle who is too polite to mention that someone is standing on his tail".  Rolf Malcolm described him as someone who smiles little and speaks slowly.{{sfn Malcolm 1957 p=51}}  Al Jaffee said he "was not an easy person to get too close to".{{sfn Benson 2009 p=214}}
File:Goodman Goes Playboy page 6 panel 4 detail (Goodman Beavers face).jpg alt= thumb
Kurtzman and wife Adele (née Hasan{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=30}}) were married in September 1948.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=38}}  They had three daughters and one son:{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=224}} Meredith, born July 28, 1950;{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=154}} Peter, born June 29, 1954;{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=287}} Elizabeth, born January 21, 1957;{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=354}} and Cornelia "Nellie", born April 15, 1969.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=469}} (Meredith in 1970 went on to become one of the contributors to It Aint Me, Babe (comics) It Aint Me, Babe, the first comic book produced entirely by women.)
Kurtzmans work allowed him to be at home with his children during the day, and he gave them much of his attention.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=236}}  As Peter had low-functioning autism,{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=370}} the Kurtzmans volunteered locally for work with special needs children,{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=236}} and in 1986 began an annual charity auction, raising money by selling the artwork of cartoonists for the Association for Mentally Ill Children of Westchester, which Adele continued to oversee following her husbands death.{{sfnm 1a1=Thompson 1y=2006 2a1=Thompson 2y=2007 3a1=Powers 3y=1987 p=17}}

==Style and working method==

{{Quote
 text = "Though it may look deceptively simple to the casual observer, [Kurtzmans art] is the end product of a long process of paring an elaborate drawing down to its essential line.  Nature is not straight.  In Kurtzmans art even the horizon is curved."
 sign = Comics historian Jacques Dutrey{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=49}} }}

According to Kurtzman, "Cartooning consists of the two elements, graphics and texts {{sic}} ... Obviously it is to the advantage of the total product to have good text and good art and the more closely integrated the good text and good art are, the greater the opportunity is to create the capital-A Art."{{sfn Harvey 2000 p=98}}  The stories he created and had others illustrate balance captions and dialogue, in contrast with, for example, Al Feldsteins EC stories, in which the artists had to compensate for the text which dominated the page.{{sfn Harvey 2000 p=98}}

In the war stories he drew himself he employed an drawing style that distorted figures in expressive ways more akin to modern art than the stylizations of contemporary superhero or funny animal comics.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=62}}  R. C. Harvey described this style as "abstract and telepathic" in stories that were realistic in the telling, but in which "his figures were exaggerated and contorted, demonstrations of posture as drama rather than reality as perceived".{{sfn Harvey 1996 p=131}}  French comics historian Jacques Dutrey described Kurtzmans style as "movement and shapes, energy and aesthetics".{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=49}}

Many liken Kurtzmans working method to that of an Auteur theory auteur.{{sfnm 1a1=Kaplan 1y=2006 1p=102 2a1=Kaplan 2y=2008 2p=72 3a1=Meskin 3a2=Cook 3y=2012 3p=49 4a1=Dortort 4a2=Ault 4y=1995 4p=32}}  In developing stories in this way Kurtzman aimed to reach a balance between text and graphics.  He developed a way of creating stories incrementally, beginning with a paragraph-long treatment of the story.  After deciding on a story and an ending which had impact, he laid out thumbnail sketches in miniature, with captions and dialogue.  He proceeded to revise repeatedly on tracing paper, tacking one layer on top of another,{{sfn Harvey 1996 p=131}} as he worked out "what characters have to say".{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=66}}  He prepared layouts on large pieces of vellum to pass on to the artists, with supplemental photographs and drawings,{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=66}} and personally led the artist through the story before the finished artwork was begun.  According to Jack Davis, "When youd pick up a story, Harvey would sit down with you and he ... acted it out, all the way through ... You felt like youd lived the story."{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=60}}

Typically when working on Little Annie Fanny, after researching the background story, Kurtzman prepared a penciled layout on Bristol board a color guide for Elder on an {{convert 8+1/2 × 11 in cm adj=on}} vellum overlay.  He would then create a larger version of the page on vellum with a {{convert 10+1/2 × 15 in cm adj=on}} image area, which he would create using colored markers, working his way up from lighter to darker colors as he tightened the composition.  He then traced this onto another sheet of vellum, or more if still unsatisfied with the results.  He would pass this on to Elder to render the final image following Kurtmans layouts exactly after having the image transferred to Paperboard illustration board.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=226}}

Kurtzmans layouts owed considerable debt to Will Eisners work on The Spirit.  He derived a chiaroscuro technique from Milt Caniff in his 1940s studio work.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=8}}

==Legacy==

Along with cartoonists such as Will Eisner, Jack Kirby, and Carl Barks, Kurtzman is regularly cited as one of the defining creators of the Golden Age of Comic Books Golden Age of American comic books.{{sfnm 1a1=Raphael 1a2=Spurgeon 1y=2004 1p=65}}  In 2003, The New York Times described Kurtzman as "one of the most important figures in postwar America" over Mad{{}}s influence on popular culture.{{sfn Wright 2003 p=}}  This was an upgrade from the Times obituary for Kurtzman in 1993, which said he had "helped found Mad Magazine." This prompted an angry response to the newspaper from Art Spiegelman, who complained that awarding Kurtzman partial credit for starting Mad was "like saying Michelangelo helped paint the Sistine Chapel just because some Pope owned the ceiling."

Kurtzman acted as Mentorship mentor to a large number of cartoonists,{{sfn Shirley 2005 p=107}} such as Terry Gilliam,{{sfnm 1a1=Gilliam 1y=2009 2a1=Thomas 2y=2002 2p=232 3a1=Oropeza 3y=2005 3p=239 4a1=Gray 4y=1999 4p=116 5a1=Gilliam 5a2=Sterritt 5a3=Rhodes 5y=2004 5p=8}} Robert Crumb,{{sfnm 1a1=Markstein 1y=2010a 2a1=Wood 2y=2012 3a1=Poplaski 3y=2005 4a1=Crumb 4a2=Holm 4y=2004 4p=206}} and Gilbert Shelton.{{sfn Gordon 2004}}  Students of his at the School of Visual Arts included John Holmstrom,{{sfnm 1a1=Shirley 1y=2005 1pp=107–108 2a1=Wolf 2y=2007 2p=114 3a1=Schelly 3y=2015 3p=522}} Batton Lash, and Drew Friedman (cartoonist) Drew Friedman.{{sfn Schelly 2015 p=523}}  Kurtzman, and particularly his work on Mad, is the most frequently cited influence on the {{not a typo underground comix}} movement{{sfnm 1a1=Estren 1y=1974 1p=294 2a1=Harvey 2y=1996 2p=140}}—comics historian Mark Estren called Mad "the granddaddy of the underground {{not a typo comics}}".{{sfn Estren 1974 p=294}}  In 1958, Robert Crumb and his older brother Charles self-published three issues of the Humbug-inspired fanzine Foo in 1958.  The venture was not a financial success, and Crumb turned to producing comics to satisfy himself.  In 1964 Kurtzman published his work in Help!.{{sfnm 1a1=Maremaa 1y=2004 1pp=29–30 2a1=Gardner 2y=2012 2pp=115–116}}

Kurtzmans style of humor influenced countercultural comedians from the 1960s on, including the sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live, according to member Harry Shearer.{{sfn Hill 2013 p=431}}  Help! contributor Terry Gilliam, who went on to be a member of Monty Python, called Kurtzman "{{interp i}}n many ways ... one of the godparents of Monty Python".{{sfnm 1a1=Edison 1y=2011 1p=88 2a1=Dooley 2y=2009}}  In his 1985 film Brazil (1985 film) Brazil, Terry Gilliam gave Ian Holms character the name "Kurtzmann".{{sfnm 1a1=Fischer 1y=2000 1p=232 2a1=Mathews 2y=1987 2p=109 3a1=Marks 3y=2009 3p=123}}  Underground cartoonist Robert Crumb asserted that one of Kurtzmans cover images for Humbug (magazine) Humbug "changed [his] life" and that another Mad cover image "changed the way [he] saw the world forever!"{{sfn Dooley 2009}}  On Kurtzmans influence Time (magazine) Time editor Richard Corliss stated, "Almost all American satire today follows a formula that Harvey Kurtzman thought up."{{sfn Corliss 2004}}

While some, such as R. C. Harvey considered it a masterpiece,{{sfn Harvey 1996 p=131}} others such as Michael Dooley felt Little Annie Fanny was "known more for its lavish production values than its humor",{{sfn Dooley 2009}} or that it compromised Kurtzmans genius.{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=209}}  A minority of underground cartoonists considered him a Selling out sell out for compromising his ideals by working for Playboy for twenty-six years.{{sfnm 1a1=Estren 1y=1974 1p=39 2a1=Kitchen 2a2=Buhle 2y=2009 p=209}}  Many fans consider Help! to be Kurtzmans "last hurrah".{{sfn Kitchen Buhle 2009 p=219}}

The Kirby Awards came to an end in 1987, and the Harvey Awards and Eisner Awards took its place.  Named in Kurtzmans honor, the Harveys are administered by Fantagraphics Books, and nominees and winners are selected by comics professionals.{{sfn Ryall Tipton 2009 p=239}}  Kurtzman was one of seven cartoonists featured in the traveling "Masters of American Comics" exhibition in 2005–2006.{{sfnm 1a1=Kitchen 1a2=Buhle 1y=2009 1p=224 2a1=Kimmelman 2y=2006}}

To Comics Journal editor and Fantagraphics publisher Gary Groth, Kurtzmans style "achieves some sort of Platonic ideal of cartooning.  Harvey was a master of composition, tone and visual rhythm, both within the panel and among the panels comprising the page.  He was also able to convey fragments of genuine humanity through an impressionistic technique that was fluid and supple."{{sfn Dooley 2009}}  Comics critic and historian R. C. Harvey conjectured that Kurtzman "may be the most influential American cartoonist since Walt Disney",{{sfn Harvey 2000 p=97}} and comics historian Don Markstein considered him "among the most influential cartoonists of the 20th century".{{sfn Markstein 2007}} In its list of the 20th centurys best hundred English-language comics, The Comics Journal awarded Kurtzman five of the slots:{{sfnm 1a1=Kitchen 1a2=Buhle 1y=2009 p=224 2a1=Spurgeon 2y=1999 2p=108}}

In 2012, Kurtzmans estate and Al Feldstein filed to reclaim the copyrights on their 1950s work at EC.  The claim was based on changes to copyright laws made in 1976, in which copyrights sold could be reclaimed by the original independent creators at the time of copyright renewal.  Under these laws Jerry Siegels estate was able to regain rights to Superman from DC Comics, but work-made-for-hire creations by Jack Kirby and Marv Wolfman were found ineligible.  The basis of the Kurtzman and Feldstein claims was that they were not employees of EC, but subcontractors.{{sfn Dean 2012}}
