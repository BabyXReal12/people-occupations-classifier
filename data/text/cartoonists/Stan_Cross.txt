Cross accepted the position and moved to Sydney in 1919.<ref name="La Trobe"/>

On 31 July 1920 Cross first comic strip, The Man Who Waited was published in Smiths Weekly, this was followed in the next week by the first episode of The Potts You & Me. Originally a satire featuring the characters, "Mr Pott" and "Whalesteeth", designed as a means of offering political comment. It was however quickly converted into a domestic humour strip. Cross continued to draw the weekly strip for nineteen years until he left Smiths in late December 1939 when the strip was taken over by Jim Russell (cartoonist) Jim Russell in 1940 and renamed to Mr & Mrs Potts.<ref name="Ryan"/>

On 17 November 1924 he married a 25-year-old clerk Jessie May Hamilton (d. 1972) at the Waverley Methodist Church, in Bondi Junction, New South Wales Bondi Junction.<ref name="ADB"/>

In 1928 Cross introduced added another strip to Smiths Weekly, Smiths Vaudevillans, introducing the mis-matched characters of "Rhubarb", an alcoholic sailor, and "Norman", a fop who plays the straight man to his drunken partner.<ref name="Ryan"/> Another Stan Cross success was the first "Dad and Dave" cartoons, also for Smiths Weekly.<ref>Blaikie, George Remember Smiths Weekly Angus & Robertson, London 1967</ref> The strip was a straight adaptation of the radio serial, which commenced in 1936, running for 2,276 episodes, before finishing in 1951.

During his time at Smiths Weekly Cross established a reputation as a skilled draftsman, particularly in the area of single-panel cartoons.<ref name="Ryan"/> In the 29 July 1933 issue of Smiths Weekly Cross drew a cartoon featuring two men who had been working on top of a building construction. But there has been a mishap, for now one is hanging by his fingers from a girder at a frightening height over a street. His mate, to save himself, has firmly grabbed the trousers of the other, yanking them down over his ankles, and looking directly upwards is convulsed with laughter, while the other implores: ‘For gorsake, stop laughing: this is serious!’.<ref name="La Trobe"/> Editor Frank Marien immediately dubbed it "The Funniest Drawing in the World". Such was the popularity of the cartoon that it was reprinted on a quality paper and distributed throughout Australia and beyond, many being sent overseas. All through the Depression years, and after, these prints costing two shillings and sixpence were framed and hung on walls in work-places, hotel bars, barbers shops, even in some shop windows.<ref name="La Trobe"/>

Cross became Smiths Weeklys highest paid artist and second art editor. Short-run series he devised included: Things That Make Stan Cross (political and economic criticism), Places We Have Never Visited (law courts, Parliament, the players room at a test cricket match, etc.), Museum of the Future and Firsts in Australian History (the first barmaid, the first strike, the first football match).<ref name="DAAO"/>

Towards the end of 1939 Smiths Weekly was in the financial trouble and Cross was induced by Keith Murdoch to join the (Melbourne) The Herald (Melbourne) Herald. Capitalising on his reputation as a comic strip artist Cross was asked to create a newly daily strip. He published his most popular strip, Wally and the Major The Winks on 20 April 1940.<ref name="Ryan"/> For the first three months the strip employed a domestic comedy theme and was basically a toned down version of You & Me. The characters "Mr Wink" reflected the role of Mr Potts, while the tall, thin, long-faced was similar to his character, "Whalesteeth". In the initial stages these characters were given their own weekly strip, Tidley Winks & Wally.<ref name="Ryan"/>  The Winks was only moderately popular until Cross decided to change the strips direction and take the main characters into the Army. Mr Winks became Major Winks on 15 July 1940 and the strip was renamed Wally and the Major.<ref name="Ryan"/> Over the next thirty years in newspapers throughout Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, and in eighteen annual comic books (c.1943–60), readers were able to enjoy the extraordinary, knock-about adventures and lifestyle of Private Wally Higgins, Major Winks, Pudden Bensen and a company of comedy players—in the army in World War II and afterwards, and on their North Queensland sugarcane plantation.<ref name="ADB"/> He continued to produce the strip until failing eyesight forced him to get help with the drawings early in 1970. Carl Lyon started to ink in Cross pencil drawings.<ref name="ACA">{{Cite web url=http://cartoonists.org.au/?page=225 title=Australian Cartoonist Hall of Fame publisher=Australian Cartoonists Association accessdate=25 October 2011}}</ref> Later Lyon took over all the drawing with Cross writing the stories and eventually took over completely when Cross retired later that year.<ref name="ADB"/>

He was a foundation member and served as president of the Australian Cartoonists Association Black and White Artists Society (later Club), Sydney from 1931 to 1954.<ref name="DAAO"/><ref name="ACA"/> Their annual trophy "Stanley Award The Stanley" was named for him, with the award taking the shape of the figures in his classic cartoon, "For gorsake, stop laughing: this is serious".<ref name="ACA2">{{Cite web url=http://www.cartoonists.org.au/?page=214 title=History of the ACA publisher=Australian Cartoonists Association accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web url=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/austn-political-cartooning title=Australian political cartooning – a rich tradition publisher=Australian Government accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref>

Cross also wrote books on accountancy, economics and English grammar<ref name="ACA"/> and treatises on soil conservation. He painted watercolours and there is some speculation that Cross and George Finey held the first exhibition at David Joness Art Gallery.<ref name="DAAO"/> In 1970 he retired from the Melbourne Herald and joined his family at Armidale, New South Wales, where he died on 16 June 1977 at the age of eighty eight.<ref name="ADB"/> The epitaph on his tombstone reads, Stop laughing, this is serious.<ref name="DAAO"/>
