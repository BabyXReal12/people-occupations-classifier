The following year he began illustrating comics, written by Frank Ashley, for Frank Johnson Publications. These included Larry Flynn, Detective.

In 1945 he produced comic strip advertisements for Colgate Palmolive, which led to Associated Newspapers placing him under contract to develop a new science fiction strip,<ref name="Bonzer"/> Silver Starr<ref name="Ryan"/> (or Silver Starr in the Flameworld). Silver Starr debuted in the Sydney newspapers The Guardian and The Sun (Australia) Sunday Sun on 24 November 1946. The strips ran until November 1948, where following a dispute regarding the print size of the strip Pitt left the paper.<ref name="Bonzer"/><ref name="DAAO"/> Silver Starr was a Flash Gordon-style comic strip centred on an Australian soldier, Silver, who on his return from the World War II Second World War, joins an expedition, with his companions, Dr. Onro and Dyson, to the Earths interior aboard a rocket-style ship. Together, they discover the incredible "Flame World" and its ruler, Queen Pristine (Pitts compliment to Raymonds Dale Arden), rescuing her from the evil despotism despot, Tarka (another acknowledgement to Raymonds character Ming the Merciless). John Ryan, in his Australian comic anthology Panel by Panel, describes the strip as having story lines of average standard for this type of comic with the real attraction being the artwork.<ref name="Ryan"/>{{Quote Under Pitts deft handling, the scenes of rock formations and underground caverns came to life; as did the seas of molten lava and the ship winding its way through rock and water.

He continued to illustrate the strip until June 1950, when the pressure of other work saw him pass the strip onto Peter James.
