==Early life==
Caroll Edwin Spinney was born in Waltham, Massachusetts Waltham, Massachusetts on December 26, 1933. His mother, a native of Bolton, England, named him Caroll because he was born the day after Christmas. He has been drawing and painting since he was a child. He developed a love of puppeteering when he saw a performance of Three Little Kittens at the age of five. This motivated him to purchase a monkey puppet from a jumble sale rummage sale three years later and put on a puppet show utilizing the monkey and a plush snake. The following Christmas his mother gifted him with a Punch and Judy puppet theater. He continued puppeteering throughout his childhood and adolescence and used his performances to raise money for college tuition.<ref>Spinney, Caroll.

===As a Sesame Street Muppeteer===

Spinney first met Jim Henson in 1962 at a puppeteering festival, where Henson asked if he would like to "talk about the The Muppets Muppets". As Spinney failed to realize the question was an employment offer, the conversation never came to pass.<ref>Spinney, Caroll. The Wisdom of Big Bird (and the Dark Genius of Oscar the Grouch), page 24 ({{ISBN 0-375-50781-7}}).</ref>

In 1969, Spinney performed at a Puppeteers of America festival in Utah. His show was a mixture of live actors and puppets but was ruined by an errant spotlight that washed out the animated backgrounds. Henson was once again in attendance and noticed Spinneys performance. "I liked what you were trying to do," Henson said, and he asked once more if they could "talk about the Muppets". This time, they did have the conversation, and Spinney joined the Muppeteers full-time by late 1969.<ref>Stephenson, Kathy; Horiuchi, Vince. "Q is for quiz: Celebrating 40 years of Sesame Street". The Salt Lake Tribune, November 15, 2009.</ref>

Spinney joined Sesame Street for the inaugural season in 1969. However, he nearly left after the first season because he was not getting acceptable pay, but Kermit Love persuaded him to stay.<ref>Spinney, Caroll.

The Wisdom of Big Bird (and the Dark Genius of Oscar the Grouch), pages 82-83; 88 ({{ISBN 0-375-50781-7}}).</ref> Japan, and across Europe. As Big Bird and Oscar, he has conducted orchestras across the United States US and Canada, including the Boston Pops Orchestra Boston Pops, as well as visited the White House multiple times.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/11/nyregion/public-lives-30-happy-years-as-an-8-foot-tall-yellow-bird.html title=30 Years as an 8&nbsp;foot bird  newspaper=The New York Times accessdate=July 1, 2017}}</ref> He has provided the characters voices on dozens of albums.{{citation needed date=December 2015}}

As Oscar, Spinney has written How to Be a Grouch, a Western Publishing Whitman Tell-A-Tale picture book. With J. Milligan, he wrote the 2003 book The Wisdom of Big Bird (and the Dark Genius of Oscar the Grouch): Lessons from a Life in Feathers ({{ISBN 0-375-50781-7}}). Spinney narrated the audiobook Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street by Michael Davis.<ref>https://www.amazon.com/Street-Gang-Complete-History-Sesame/dp/1593161409/ref=tmm_abk_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1498886176&sr=8-3</ref> His work has been studied by other international puppeteers who structure their performance styles after his, most evidently with full-body puppet costumes. The Chinese performer of Big Bird Da Niao on Zhima Jie is most evident of this, as the character is an exact physical replica of Big Bird.<ref>{{cite web title=I AM BIG BIRD: Exclusive TRAINING CHINESE BIG BIRD url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_YaZmujaO4 website=YouTube publisher=Copper Pot Pictures accessdate=June 30, 2017}}</ref>

Though Big Bird and Oscar are his main characters, Spinney has also performed as other characters. At one point, he created and performed Bruno the Trash Man, a full-bodied puppet representing a garbage carrier, who also carried Sesame Street (fictional location)#Oscar the Grouchs Trash Can Oscars trash can. Bruno was used until the foam plastic of the character broke down.<ref>Spinney, Caroll. The Wisdom of Big Bird (and the Dark Genius of Oscar the Grouch), page 62 ({{ISBN 0-375-50781-7}}).</ref>

Spinney has performed as Granny Bird, Big Birds grandmother. The puppet used for Granny Bird is actually a spare Big Bird puppet, and Spinney provides her voice. As Granny Birds appearances are often alongside Big Bird (who is, as she stated, her "favorite grandson"), her voice is usually pre-recorded so that Spinney can perform Big Bird. Spinney was one of many puppeteers of a Muppet named Baby Monster in the 1970s.<ref>Rothman, Michael.

The character was taken over by Richard Hunt (puppeteer) Richard Hunt in 1984 and finally given to Kevin Clash by Hunt a year later. Spinney reprised his role as Oscar the Grouch in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian in a cameo appearance next to Darth Vader.<ref>{{cite web title=Night At The Museum 2 url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/night-at-the-museum-2/cast/306359/ website=TV Guide.com publisher=TV Guide accessdate=May 9, 2018}}</ref>
