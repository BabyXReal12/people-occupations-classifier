Michael John Kricfalusi ({{IPAc-en , k r I s f @  l u: s i}}; born September 9, 1955), better known as John K., is a Canada Canadian animator, voice actor, creator of the Nickelodeon cartoon series The Ren & Stimpy Show and founder of the animation company Spümcø.

After being fired from The Ren & Stimpy Show by Nickelodeon in 1992, Kricfalusi went on to direct and produce animated television commercials and music videos for entertainers such as the singer Björk and comedy rock duo Tenacious D. In the late 1990s he created the first cartoons made exclusively for the Internet: The Goddamn George Liquor Program and Weekend Pussy Hunt. He returned to television with The Ripping Friends and the adult animation spin-off Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon".

==Career==
===Entering the animation industry===
After moving to Los Angeles, Kricfalusi was introduced to Milt Gray by Bob Clampett, suggesting he should join Grays classical animation class. Gray was working for Filmation at the time, and soon Kricfalusi found work there as well,<ref name="Goodman2003">{{cite web url=http://www.awn.com/articles/drtoon/tell-story-interview-john-kricfalusi/page/4 author=Martin Goodman date=January 23, 2003 accessdate=January 8, 2011 work=Animation World Magazine title=An Interview with John Kricfalusi deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014142529/http://www.awn.com/articles/drtoon/tell-story-interview-john-kricfalusi/page/4 archivedate=October 14, 2012 df=mdy-all}}</ref> getting his start on the shows like Super Friends (1980 TV series) Super Friends and The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show.<ref name="founding">{{cite book first=Lou  last=Scheimer  first2=Andy  last2=Mangels date=2012  title=Lou Scheimer: Creating the Filmation Generation  publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing  location=Raleigh, North Carolina  pages=165  ISBN= 978-1-60549-044-1}}</ref> His first independent cartoon was a short called Ted Bakes One, which he produced with Bill Wray in 1979 for a cable channel.<ref name="JasonRivera">{{cite web url=http://unofficialspumco.com/html/view01.html  title=An interview with John  author=Jason Rivera  date=c. 2000  accessdate=September 29, 2016  archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130225012920/http://web.archive.org/web/20060406230803/http://unofficialspumco.com/html/view01.html  archivedate=February 25, 2013  deadurl=yes  df= }}</ref> From 1979 to the mid-1980s, Kricfalusi worked for Filmation and later Hanna-Barbera and DIC Entertainment on various shows that he once described as "the worst animation of all time".<ref name="Spin" /><ref name="JKimdb">{{cite web url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0471136/  title=John Kricfalusi publisher=IMDB.com  accessdate=January 28, 2007}}</ref> However, he did enjoy his work as a layout artist on the 1985 series of The Jetsons as he was able to train a team of Taiwanese people Taiwanese animators to draw characters more emotive and wild, which at the time was considered radical.<ref>{{cite web url=http://johnkstuff.blogspot.ie/2008/11/1985-jetsons-layouts.html title=L.O. 11: Layouts Spumco History: 1985 Jetsons Layouts author=John Kricfalusi date= November 11, 2008 accessdate=May 11, 2015}}</ref> He recalls being "saved" from having to work on these cartoons by director Ralph Bakshi, whod worked with him before in 1981 and 1982.<ref name="NickDigilio">{{cite interview  last=Kricfalusi  first=John  interviewer=Nick Digilio  title=An Interview with John K  work=WGN Radio  url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lR35X1W1tQ  location=Chicago, Illinois  date=2003 accessdate=December 25, 2015 }}</ref><ref name="JKOnion">{{cite web  first=Tasha last=Robinson url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/john-kricfalusi,13702/  title=John Kricfalusi, interview  website=The AV Club publisher=Onion Inc  location=Chicago, Illinois date=March 4, 2001  accessdate=January 17, 2010}}</ref> They began working on the designs for the film Bobbys Girl, which was sold to TriStar Pictures but was later cancelled.<ref name="JKOnion"/><ref name="OcalaStarBanner">{{cite news  first=Lewis last=Beale  url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vNATAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jgYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6858,5173905&dq=ocala+star-banner+dec+31+1987+bakshi&hl=en  title=Animator Bakshi Enjoys Film Satire newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner  publisher=New Media Investment Group location=Ocala, Florida date=December 31, 1987  accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref><ref name="BakshiFilm">{{cite web  first=Ralph last=Bakshi authorlink=Ralph Bakshi url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=3649#3649  title=Your Project with John K.   work=The Official Ralph Bakshi Website  accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref> Under Bakshi, Kricfalusi directed the animation for The Rolling Stones 1986 music video "Harlem Shuffle".<ref>{{Cite web url=http://agentpalmer.com/13885/media/rotospective-the-rolling-stones-and-ralph-bakshi-harlem-shuffle-video-is-the-kind-of-magic-that-happens-when-bad-boys-collide/ title=Rotospective: The Rolling Stones and Ralph Bakshi ‘Harlem Shuffle’ Video is the kind of magic that happens when Bad Boys Collide website=agentpalmer.com language=en-US date=February 18, 2016 access-date=February 28, 2018}}</ref>

===Mighty Mouse===
{{Main Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures}}
The teams most successful project was Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures for CBS, based on the classic Terrytoons character. The series was well-received, and it is considered the forerunner of creator-driven cartoons.<ref>{{cite web  first=Warren last=Clements  url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/a-trail-blazing-rodent/article794315/ title=A trail-blazing rodent  newspaper=The Globe and Mail  publisher=The Woodbridge Company location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada date=December 31, 2009  access-date=June 29, 2016}}</ref><ref name="WiredMightyMouse">{{cite magazine title=How Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures Amped Up Animation url=https://www.wired.com/2010/01/mighty-mouse-new-adventures/ magazine=Wired (magazine) Wired publisher=Condé Nast location=New York City date=January 5, 2010 access-date=June 29, 2016}}</ref> Kricfalusi directed eight of the twenty-six episodes and supervised the series.<ref name="WhosWho" /> At the beginning of the second season, Kricfalusi left the show. The production of Mighty Mouse was very different from other cartoons at the time, gaining creative and artistic leeway thanks to the success of the irreverent Pee-wees Playhouse on CBS a year before. The animators had much more creative input, driven by Kricfalusis production system that emphasizes artistic contribution in every step of the process, from outline to storyboard to layout to the animation.<ref name="BruceTimm">{{cite book  first = Eric last = Nolen-Weathington   title = Modern Masters Volume 3: Bruce Timm  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMwn_4llWK0C&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26#v=onepage&q&f=false publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing  location=Raleigh, North Carolina date = 2004  isbn = 1-893905-30-6  pages=26–32  access-date=June 29, 2016}}</ref>

Mighty Mouse was cancelled amidst controversy for allegedly depicting the main character snorting cocaine. Bakshi maintained that neither he nor Kricfalusi had the character sniffing cocaine, and that the character was sniffing the crushed petals of a flower, which were handed to him in a previous scene in the cartoon.<ref>{{cite web  first=Craig last=Wolff url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/26/nyregion/mighty-mouse-flying-high-on-flowers.html  title=Mighty Mouse Flying High on Flowers?  newspaper=The New York Times  publisher=New York Times Company location=New York City  date=July 26, 1988  access-date=June 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3889356.html  title=Mighty Mouse accused of sniffing cocaine  newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times  publisher=Sun Times Media Group location=Chicago, Illinois date=June 10, 1988  access-date=June 29, 2016 via=highbeam.com subscription=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  first=Tasha  last=Robinson url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/ralph-bakshi,13690  title=Ralph Bakshi, Interview  website=The AV Club publisher=Onion Inc  location=Chicago, Illinois date=December 6, 2000  access-date=June 29, 2016}}</ref> In 1994, Kricfalusi pitched a revival series of Mighty Mouse to Paramount Pictures Paramount, which would have featured other Terrytoons characters such as Deputy Dawg, but they rejected the idea.<ref>{{cite web url=http://johnkstuff.blogspot.ie/2011/03/mighty-mouse-pitch-circa-1994.html  title=Mighty Mouse Pitch circa 1994?  date=March 20, 2011  access-date=November 19, 2013}}</ref>

===Beany and Cecil===
{{Main The New Adventures of Beany and Cecil}}
Kricfalusi left Bakshis studio to work on The New Adventures of Beany and Cecil for American Broadcasting Company ABC, where he teamed up with many of the people who would later work with him on many of his Spümcø projects.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1028626/fullcredits  title=Beany and Cecil (1988) full credits publisher=IMDB.com  accessdate=January 17, 2010}}</ref> ABC had been negotiating for the production of the show with the Clampett family, who insisted that Kricfalusi be part of the production as he was a strong proponent of Bob Clampetts cartoon style. The long negotiations delayed the start of production to mid-July, causing much of the animation to be rushed in order to meet the September deadline. Tensions rose between Kricfalusi and ABC over the tone of the show, leading to an uncomfortable atmosphere for the shows crew. The more ABC strove to soften the show, the more Kricfalusi pushed for shocking and offensive material. The Clampett family were ultimately not very happy with the cartoon, but remained supportive of Kricfalusi.<ref name="BruceTimm" /> ABC cancelled the show after six episodes, finding the humor not suitable for childrens programming.<ref name="Spin" />

===Ren & Stimpy===
{{Main The Ren & Stimpy Show}}
Kricfalusi formed Spümcø animation studio with partners Jim Smith (animator) Jim Smith, Bob Camp and Lynne Naylor.<ref name="NYT1992" /> They began working on a pilot for The Ren & Stimpy Show on behalf of Nickelodeon, after the eponymous characters were favored by Nickelodeon producer Vanessa Coffey in a presentation by Kricfalusi. The pilot was very well received, leading to the production of the first 13 half-hour episodes of the show.<ref name="ComicsInterview">{{cite web  url=http://comics122.blogspot.com/2006/11/bill-wray.html  title=Bill Wray, interview  author=Charles S.

Fox Kids started airing the TV series The Ripping Friends in 2001, created by Kricfalusi and Jim Smith.

==Influences==
Kricfalusi says he is mostly self-taught, having only spent a year in Sheridan College, barely attending class. He acquired his skills largely by copying cartoons from newspapers and comic books as a child, and by studying cartoons and their production systems from the 1940s and 1950s.<ref name="CartoonVoiceActors" /><ref name="DanPersons" /><ref name="JasonRivera" /><ref name="Spin" /> His main influence is Bob Clampett,<ref name="BruceTimm" /><ref name="Dixon">{{cite book first=Wheeler W. last=Dixon title=Creating Ren and Stimpy url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWywnr1dNucC year=2001 work=Collected Interviews: Voices from Twentieth-Century Cinema publisher=SIU Press pages=82–94}}</ref> and he also names Chuck Jones, Frank Sinatra, Kirk Douglas,<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.harrymccracken.com/animato/johnk.htm  title= An Interview With Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures John Kricfalusi  author=Harry McCracken  date=Spring 1988  work=Animato #16  accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web  url=http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2007/09/kirk-greatest-hollywood-actor.html  title=Kirk Douglas, The Greatest Hollywood Actor  author=John Kricfalusi  date=September 20, 2007  work=John K Stuff  accessdate=December 27, 2009}}</ref> Milt Gross, Tex Avery, Peter Lorre, The Three Stooges, Al Jolson, Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, Elvis Presley, Don Martin (cartoonist) Don Martin and Robert Ryan.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://www.myspace.com/jkricfalusi  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081104175510/http://www.myspace.com/jkricfalusi archivedate=November 4, 2008 title=John Kricfalusi, MySpace  accessdate=December 27, 2009}}</ref> Michael Barrier (historian) Michael Barrier, an animation historian, said that Kricfalusis works "testify to his intense admiration for Bob Clampetts Warner Bros. cartoons" and that no cartoonist since Clampett created cartoons in which the emotions of the characters "distort their bodies so powerfully".<ref>{{cite book  last = Barrier  first = Michael  title = Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age  publisher = Oxford University Press US  year = 2003  isbn = 0-19-516729-5  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDJXnzMh7bkC&lpg=PA571&pg=PA571#v=onepage&q=&f=false  accessdate=January 17, 2010}}</ref>

==Sexual abuse allegations==
{{see also Weinstein effect}}
Animators Robyn Byrd and Katie Rice alleged in a BuzzFeed report on March 29, 2018, that Kricfalusi sexually harassed and child grooming groomed them for sexual abuse while they were underage.<ref name="BuzzFeed">{{cite news first=Ariane last=Lange url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/arianelange/john-kricfalusi-ren-stimpy-underage-sexual-abuse title= Creator Of "Ren & Stimpy" Accused Of Preying On Underage Girls Who Wanted Animation Careers website=BuzzFeed date=March 29, 2018 accessdate=March 30, 2018}}</ref> Byrd said that she was in a sexual relationship with Kricfalusi in 1997 at age 16, and flew to California to live with him when she was 17. Rice said that Kricfalusi flirted with her and made overt sexual comments towards her since she was 14, and was sexually harassed by him when she turned 18 and began working at his animation studio, Spümcø. Documents they had saved from those years corroborate their stories, and several people who worked with Kricfalusi referred to his sexual harassment as an open secret in the animation industry. Kricfalusi was also alleged to possess child pornography on his computer. Kricfalusis lawyer confirmed that "for a brief time, 25 years ago, he had a 16-year-old girlfriend", but denied that Kricfalusis "avid pursuit" of Rice was sexual harassment or that he had ever possessed child pornography.<ref name="BuzzFeed"/> Kricfalusi published an apology to the women and his fans for his behavior, which he said was motivated by undiagnosed bipolar disorder and ADHD, as well as "poor impulse control".<ref>{{cite news first=Kate last=Feldman url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/ren-stimpy-creator-apologizes-misconduct-claims-article-1.3989661 title=‘Ren & Stimpy’ creator John Kricfalusi apologizes to women who accused him of sexual misconduct newspaper=New York Daily News publisher=Tronc location=New York City date=May 14, 2018 accessdate=August 8, 2018}}</ref> Byrd and Rice criticized Kricfalusis statement as a non-apology and an attempt to deflect the blame.<ref>{{cite news first=Gene last=Maddeus url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/john-kricfalusi-apology-slammed-ren-and-stimpy-1202809703/ title=‘Ren & Stimpy’ Creator Slammed for ‘Apology’ to Underage Girls work=Variety (magazine) Variety publisher=Penske Media Corporation location=New York City date=May 14, 2018 accessdate=June 3, 2018}}</ref>
