Frederic Ogden Nash (August 19, 1902 – May 19, 1971) was an American poet well known for his Light poetry light verse, of which he wrote over 500 pieces. With his unconventional rhyme rhyming schemes, he was declared the countrys best-known producer of humorous poetry.

==Early life==

Nash was born in Rye (city), New York Rye, New York (state) New York, the son of Mattie (Chenault) and Edmund Strudwick Nash.<ref name="Lehman2006">{{cite book first=David  last=Lehman  title=The Oxford Book of American Poetry  url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gO0AK7qCvmoC&pg=PA475  year=2006  publisher=Oxford University Press  isbn=978-0-19-516251-6  page=475}}</ref><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Mo-Ni/Nash-Ogden.html title=Ogden Nash Biography - life, family, children, parents, death, school, book, information, born, movie website=notablebiographies.com accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> His father owned and operated an import–export company, and because of business obligations, the family relocated often. Nash was descended from Abner Nash, an early governor of North Carolina. The city of Nashville, Tennessee, was named for Abners brother, Francis Nash Francis, a Revolutionary War general.<ref name="NCHistory">{{cite web title=NC Highway Markers, printable view url=http://www.ncmarkers.com/print_marker.aspx?MarkerId=G-10 website=North Carolina Office of Archives and History}}</ref><ref>{{cite book editor1-last=Powell editor1-first=William title=Dictionary of North Carolina Biography, v4 page=358}}</ref>

Throughout his life, Nash loved to rhyme.  "I think in terms of rhyme, and have since I was six years old," he stated in a 1958 news interview.<ref name="APQuote">{{Cite news first=Hal  last=Boyle  title=Ogden Nash Finds Light Verse Doesnt Flow Easy  url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zu0KAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3U8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6654,1365475  agency=Associated Press  work=Prescott Evening Courier  date=December 1, 1958  accessdate=19 October 2008}}</ref> He had a fondness for crafting his own words whenever rhyming words did not exist, though admitting that crafting rhymes was not always the easiest task.<ref name="APQuote"/>

His family lived briefly in Savannah, Georgia, in a carriage house owned by Juliette Gordon Low, founder of the Girl Scouts of the USA; he wrote a poem about Juliette Gordon Low#Founding the Girl Scouts Mrs. Lows House.  After graduating from St. Georges School, Newport St. Georges School in Newport County, Rhode Island, Nash entered Harvard University in 1920, only to drop out a year later.

He returned as a teacher to St. Georges for one year before returning to New York.<ref name="georev">{{cite journal  last=Phillips  first=Louis  title=Reviewed work(s): Ogden Nash: The Life and Work of Americas Laureate of Light Verse by Douglas M.

However, I saw lots of good movies."<ref name="georev"/> Nash then took a position as a writer of the streetcar card ads for Barron Collier,<ref name="georev"/> a company that previously had employed another Baltimore resident, F.

In 1931 he married Frances Leonard.<ref>{{cite web url=http://baltimoreauthors.ubalt.edu/writers/ogdennash.htm title=Ogden Nash website=baltimoreauthors.ubalt.edu accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref> He published his first collection of poems, Hard Lines, that same year, earning him national recognition.<ref name="CbsStamp">{{cite news last1=Vries first1=Lloyd title=Postage Stamp Bash / For Ogden Nash url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/postage-stamp-bash-for-ogden-nash/ accessdate=April 11, 2017 publisher=CBS News date=July 19, 2002}}</ref> Some of his poems reflected an anti-establishment feeling. For example, one verse, titled Common Sense, asks:
<blockquote><poem>Why did the Lord give us agility,
If not to evade responsibility?</poem></blockquote>

In 1934, Nash moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where he remained until his death in 1971. Nash thought of Baltimore as home. After his return from a brief move to New York, he wrote, apropos Richard Lovelace, "I could have loved New York had I not loved Balti-more."

==Writing career==
When Nash wasnt writing poems, he made guest appearances on comedy and radio shows and toured the United States and the United Kingdom, giving lectures at colleges and universities.

Nash was regarded with respect by the literary establishment, and his poems were frequently anthologized even in serious collections such as Selden Rodmans 1946 A New Anthology of Modern Poetry.

Nash was the lyricist for the Broadway musical One Touch of Venus, collaborating with librettist S. J. Perelman and composer Kurt Weill. The show included the notable song "Speak Low." He also wrote the lyrics for the 1952 revue Twos Company (musical) Twos Company.

Nash and his love of the History of the Indianapolis Colts Baltimore Colts were featured in the December 13, 1968 issue of Life (magazine) Life,<ref>{{Cite journal  last =Nash   first =Ogden   date =December 13, 1968   title =My Colts, verses and reverses   journal =Life (magazine) Life  volume=65  issue=24  pages=75  ISSN=0024-3019   url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVQEAAAAMBAJ&q=ogden#v=onepage&q&f=false  accessdate=1 August 2014   format = – <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3ANash+intitle%3AMy+Colts%2C+verses+and+reverses&as_publication=%5B%5BLife+%28magazine%29%7CLife%5D%5D&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> }}</ref> with several poems about the American football team matched to full-page pictures. Entitled "My Colts, verses and reverses," the issue includes his poems and photographs by Arthur Rickerby.  "Mr. Nash, the league leading writer of light verse (Averaging better than 6.3 lines per carry), lives in Baltimore and loves the Colts," it declares. The comments further describe Nash as "a fanatic of the Baltimore Colts, and a gentleman."  Featured on the magazine cover is defensive player Dennis Gaubatz, number 53, in midair pursuit with this description:  "That is he, looming 10 feet tall or taller above the Pittsburgh Steelers Steelers signal caller...Since Gaubatz acts like this on Sunday, Ill do my quarterbacking Monday." Memorable Colts Jimmy Orr, Billy Ray Smith Sr. Billy Ray Smith, Bubba Smith, Willie Richardson, Dick Szymanski and Lou Michaels contribute to the poetry.

Among his most popular writings were a series of animal verses, many of which featured his off-kilter rhyming devices. Examples include "If called by a panther / Dont anther"; "Who wants my jellyfish? / Im not sellyfish!"; "The one-L lama, hes a priest.  The two-L llama, hes a beast.  And I will bet a silk pajama: there isnt any three-L lllama!". Nash later appended the footnote "  *The authors attention has been called to a type of conflagration known as a three-alarmer. Pooh."<ref>{{cite web url=http://wonderingminstrels.blogspot.com/2002/08/lama-ogden-nash.html title=The Lama – Ogden Nash website=wonderingminstrels.blogspot.com accessdate=April 5, 2018}}</ref>

The best of his work was published in 14 volumes between 1931 and 1972.

==Death and subsequent events==
Nash died at Baltimores Johns Hopkins Hospital on May 19, 1971, of complications from Crohns disease aggravated by a lactobacillus infection transmitted by improperly prepared coleslaw.<ref name="NYTobit"/> He is buried in East Side Cemetery in North Hampton, New Hampshire.<ref>{{cite web title=Guide to the Ogden Nash Letters, 1968–1969 url=https://www.library.unh.edu/find/archives/collections/ogden-nash-letters-1968-1969 publisher=University of New Hampshire accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref>

A biography, Ogden Nash: the Life and Work of Americas Laureate of Light Verse, was written by Douglas M. Parker, published in 2005 and in paperback in 2007. The book was written with the cooperation of the Nash family, and quotes extensively from Nashs personal correspondence as well as his poetry.

His daughter Isabel was married to noted photographer Fred Eberstadt, and his granddaughter, Fernanda Eberstadt, is an acclaimed author. Nash had one other daughter, Linell Nash Smith.

==Poetic style==
Nash was best known for surprising, pun-like rhymes, sometimes with words deliberately misspelled for comic effect, as in his retort to Dorothy Parkers humorous dictum, Men seldom make passes / At girls who wear glasses:

<blockquote><poem>A girl whos bespectacled
May not get her nectacled</poem></blockquote>

In this example, the word "nectacled" sounds like the phrase "neck tickled" when rhymed with the previous line.

Sometimes the words rhyme by mispronunciation rather than misspelling, as in:

<blockquote><poem>Farewell, farewell, you old rhinoceros,
Ill stare at something less prepoceros</poem></blockquote>

Another typical example of rhyming by combining words occurs in "The Adventures of Isabel", when Isabel confronts a witch who threatens to turn her into a toad:

<blockquote><poem>She showed no rage and she showed no rancor,
But she turned the witch into milk, and drank her.</poem></blockquote>

Nash often wrote in an exaggerated verse form with pairs of lines that rhyme, but are of dissimilar length and irregular meter:

:Once there was a man named Mr. Palliser and he asked his wife, May I be a gourmet?
:And she said, You sure may.

Nashs poetry was often a playful twist of an old saying or poem. For one example, he expressed this playfulness in what is perhaps his most famous rhyme, a twist on Joyce Kilmers poem Trees (poem) "Trees" (1913): "I think that I shall never see / a poem lovely as a tree," which drops "billboard" in place of poem and adds, "Indeed, unless the billboards fall / Ill never see a tree at all."<ref name="facefamiliar">Nash, Ogden, "Song of the Open Road, The Face Is Familiar (Garden City Publishing, 1941), p. 21.</ref> That same playfulness produced a number of often quoted quips, including "Progress might have been all right once, but it has gone on too long" and "People who work sitting down get paid more than people who work standing up."

==Other poems==
Nash, a baseball fan, wrote a poem titled "Line-Up for Yesterday," an alphabetical poem listing baseball immortals.<ref>{{Cite news first=Tim  last=Wiles  title=Whos on Verse?  work=The New York Times  date=March 31, 1996  url=https://www.nytimes.com/specials/baseball/bbo-baseball-preview-poetry.html  accessdate=23 January 2008  archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20001217013500/http://www.nytimes.com/specials/baseball/bbo-baseball-preview-poetry.html  archivedate = December 17, 2000}}</ref> Published in Sport (US magazine) Sport magazine in January 1949, the poem pays tribute to the baseball greats and to his own fandom, in alphabetical order. Here is a sampling from his A to Z list:<ref>{{Cite web title=Baseball Almanac url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_line.shtml accessdate=23 January 2008 }}</ref>

<blockquote><poem><u>C</u> is for Ty Cobb Cobb, Who grew spikes and not corn, And made all the basemen Wish they werent born.
<u>D</u> is for Dizzy Dean Dean, The grammatical Diz, When they asked, Whos the tops? Said correctly, I is.
<u>E</u> is for Johnny Evers Evers, His jaw in advance; Never afraid To Joe Tinker Tinker with Frank Chance Chance.
<u>F</u> is for Frankie Frisch Fordham And Frankie and Frisch; I wish he were back With the San Francisco Giants#New York Giants history Giants, I wish.</poem></blockquote>

Nash particularly loved Baltimore sports teams.

Nash wrote humorous poems for each movement of the Camille Saint-Saëns orchestral suite The Carnival of the Animals, which are sometimes recited when the work is performed. The original recording of this version was made by Columbia Records in the 1940s, with Noël Coward reciting the poems and Andre Kostelanetz conducting the orchestra.

He wrote a humorous poem about the IRS and income tax titled Song for the Saddest Ides, a reference to March 15, the ides (calendar) ides of March, when federal taxes were due at the time.  It was later set to music and performed by the IRS Chorale until its composer/conductors later retirement.{{citation needed date=June 2016}}

Many of his poems, reflecting the times in which they were written, presented ethnic stereotype stereotypes of different nationalities. For example, in Genealogical Reflections he writes:

<blockquote><poem>No McTavish
Was ever Lavish</poem></blockquote>

In The Japanese published in 1938, Nash presents an allegory for the expansionist policies of the Empire of Japan:

<blockquote><poem>How courteous is the Japanese;
He always says, "Excuse it, please."
He climbs into his neighbor’s garden,
And smiles, and says, "I beg your pardon";
He bows and grins a friendly grin,
And calls his hungry family in;
He grins, and bows a friendly bow;
"So sorry, this my garden now."</poem><ref>Nash, Ogden. Im a Stranger Here Myself (Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1938), p. 35.</ref></blockquote>

He published some poems for children, including "The Adventures of Isabel", which begins: 

<blockquote><poem>Isabel met an enormous bear,
Isabel, Isabel, didnt care;
The bear was hungry, the bear was ravenous,
The bears big mouth was cruel and cavernous.
The bear said, "Isabel, glad to meet you,
How do, Isabel, now Ill eat you!"
Isabel, Isabel, didnt worry.
Isabel didnt scream or scurry.
She washed her hands and she straightened her hair up,
Then Isabel quietly ate the bear up.</poem></blockquote>

==Postage stamp==
