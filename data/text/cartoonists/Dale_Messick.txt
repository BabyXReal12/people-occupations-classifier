Dalia Messick (April 11, 1906 &ndash; April 5, 2005) was an American comic strip artist who used the pseudonym Dale Messick. She was the creator of Brenda Starr, Reporter, which at its peak during the 1950s ran in 250 newspapers.

Her mother Bertha was a milliner and seamstress; her work inspired some of the glamorous hats used in the Brenda Starr strip.<ref name=NYT/> After her family moved to Hobart, Indiana, Messick, who repeated third and eighth grades,<ref name=NYT /> attended Hobart High School (Indiana) Hobart High School,<ref>{{cite news url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/lifestyles/ct-ptb-brenda-starr-st-0317-20170309-story.html  title=Porter County Museum honors Brenda Starr creator  work=Post-Tribune  location=Northwest Indiana  first=Philip  last=Potempa date=March 9, 2017 accessdate= July 11, 2017 archivedate=April 21, 2017 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421084006/http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/lifestyles/ct-ptb-brenda-starr-st-0317-20170309-story.html deadurl=no}}</ref> earning her degree at age 20.<ref name=NYT /> She studied for one summer at the Ray Commercial Art School in Chicago, but left to begin a career as a professional artist.<ref name=AWN>{{cite web url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/dale-messick-comic-strip-life title=Dale Messick: A Comic Strip Life first=Jackie last=Leger date=July 1, 2000 accessdate=July 11, 2017 publisher=Animation World Network archivedate=July 11, 2017 archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6rt7gubPW?url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/dale-messick-comic-strip-life deadurl=no df=}}</ref>

==Greeting cards==
Messick began working for a Chicago greeting card company<ref name=Post/> and was successful but quit when her boss lowered her pay during the Great Depression. In 1933, she moved to New York City where she found work with another greeting card company at a higher salary, $50 a week, sending nearly half of it back to her family in Indiana. She recalled, "I had $30 a week to live it up. You could walk down 42nd Street and have bacon and eggs and toast and coffee and hash brown potatoes and orange juice&mdash;the works&mdash;for 25 cents."<ref name=Post/><ref name=Howell/>

==Comic strips==
She began assembling a portfolio of comic strip samples. Messick was not the first female comic strip creator; Nell Brinkley, Gladys Parker and Edwina Dumm had all achieved success in the field, but there was still a bias against women. Messick decided to change her first name to the androgynous "Dale" so her work would be seen by editors.<ref name=Post>{{cite news last=Sullivan first=Patricia url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35837-2005Apr7.html title=Cartoonist Dale Messick Dies; Creator of Brenda Starr Strip work=The Washington Post date=April 8, 2005 page=B06 accessdate=July 11, 2017 archivedate=February 5, 2013 archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130205182620/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35837-2005Apr7.html deadurl=no df=}}</ref> She created a variety of comic strips (Weegee, Mimi the Mermaid, Peg and Pudy, the Struglettes, Streamline Babies), but none was selected for publication.<ref name=NYT/>

==Brenda Starr, Reporter==
Messick created the character of Brenda Starr in 1940, naming it after 1930s debutante Brenda Frazier,<ref name=NYT/> and basing her appearance on Rita Hayworth.<ref name=Chronicle/> Messick wanted to produce a strip with a female protagonist; she decided a career as a reporter would allow her character to travel and have adventures, albeit adventures more glamorous than those actually experienced by most reporters. She said in a 1986 article in the San Francisco Chronicle, "I used to get letters from girl reporters saying that their lives were nowhere near as exciting as Brendas. I told them that if I made Brendas life like theirs, nobody would read it."<ref>Obituary, Editor & Publisher</ref>

Her break came when she came to the attention of another woman, Mollie Slott,<ref name=Chronicle/> who worked as a "Girl Friday (idiom)#Idiom girl Friday" (à la His Girl Friday) for New York Daily News publisher (and syndicate head) Joseph Medill Patterson. Patterson, reputedly biased against female cartoonists, would not sign her up for daily publication in the News,<ref name=Chronicle/> but he accepted Brenda Starr, Reporter for syndication as a Sunday strip Sunday comic, and it made its debut on June 30, 1940. The strip was an immediate success, since the mix of adventure and romance was popular with both male and female readers. By 1945, the strip was syndicated nationally and published daily.

Messick stopped drawing the strip in 1980 and ended her role writing the script two years later. Ramona Fradon (artist) and Linda Sutter (writer) took over production of the strip. Mary Schmich took over as writer in 1985, and June Brigman as artist in 1995. The final strip was published on January 2, 2011.<ref>{{cite news first=Dave last=Itzkoff work=The New York Times title=Stop the Presses: ‘Brenda Starr, Reporter’ Comic Is Ending url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/stop-the-presses-brenda-starr-reporter-comic-is-ending/ date=December 9, 2010 accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref> Messick was not impressed with her successors versions of Starr, according to a 1998 quote in the Sonoma County Independent: "Now it doesnt look like Brenda at all. She looks more like she works at a bank. No glamour, no curves, no fashion &mdash; but its still going pretty good.".<ref name=Howell>{{cite news last= Howell first= Daedalus url= http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/02.19.98/comics-9807.html title= Brenda Starrs Dale Messick is a firecracker work= Sonoma County Independent location= California date= February 19–25, 1998 publisher= Metro Publishing accessdate= July 11, 2017 archivedate= January 29, 2013 archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130129030502/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/02.19.98/comics-9807.html deadurl= no df= }}</ref>  

==Other endeavors==
Messick worked on other comic strips, but none achieved the success of Brenda Starr, Reporter. The only other strip which she worked on which is generally remembered was Perry Mason, which she illustrated.

On April 24, 1955, she appeared on Whats My Line? After Dorothy Kilgallen correctly identified her as a comic strip artist, the panel was given a full description of her real name, professional name and job as "illustrator" of Brenda Starr, Reporter.<ref>{{cite AV media url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEXL3d1RKBk  title=Whats My Line? - Rosemary Clooney date= April 24, 1955 publisher=The Whats My Line?
