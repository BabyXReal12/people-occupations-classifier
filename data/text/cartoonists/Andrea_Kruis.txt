Andrea Kruis (born 22 October 1962 in Rotterdam) is a Netherlands Dutch comics artist. She followed the footsteps of father Jan Kruis, best known for his one-page comic Jan, Jans en de Kinderen (Jack, Jacky & the Juniors). Catootje, the younger bespectacled half of the two daughters, is modelled after Andrea.

Andrea Kruis went to the Minerva Art Academy in Groningen (city) Groningen. Andrea illustrated several childrens books. Starting in 1991 she creates comics for weekly magazines. Her first book was published in 1998.

Her work, although visibly influenced by her father, is softer and more minimalistic than his efforts.
