Scarfe also provided the opening titles for Yes Minister and Yes, Prime Minister.

==Early life==
Scarfe was born in St Johns Wood, London.<ref>GRO Register of Births: SEP 1936 1a 774 HAMPSTEAD, Gerald A. Scarfe, mmn = Gardner</ref> As Scarfe was severely asthmatic as a child, he spent many of his early years bed-ridden, so drawing became a means of entertainment as well as a creative outlet. It has been speculated{{bywhom date=December 2017}} that the grotesque and diseased images that often characterise his work are a result of these experiences. He has himself stated that the irreverence apparent in much of his work can be traced back to "dodgy treatments" and a reliance on what he feels were incompetent doctors.<ref>{{cite news first=Kevin last=Perry title=Gerald Scarfe feature interview and profile url=http://kevinegperry.com/2007/02/27/gerald-scarfe-interview publisher=The Beaver date=27 February 2007 accessdate=29 September 2010 location=London, UK}}</ref> At the age of 14 and now living in Hampstead, he decided it would be easy to cycle to Bayswater and visit the cartoonist Ronald Searle.  He went several times but never rang the doorbell. It would be many years later that he would actually meet Ronald Searle. He went to Saint Martins School of Art (now part of the University of the Arts London) in Holborn, London.<ref name=horn>Maurice Horn (1983).

Accessed August 2013.</ref> He also went to the London College of Communication London College of Printing and East Ham Technical College (became Newham College of Further Education).{{citation needed date=June 2014}}

==Career==

===Early work===
After briefly working in advertising, a profession he grew to dislike intensely, Scarfes early caricatures of public figures were published in satirical magazine Private Eye throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Beginning in 1960, he produced illustrations for Punch (magazine) Punch, The Evening Standard and The Daily Sketch. The Sunday Times magazine assigned Scarfe to cover the 1964 US Presidential election. He continued to work for The Sunday Times for two years, also producing several cover illustrations for Time magazine.<ref>{{cite book last1=Souter first1=Nick last2=Souter first2=Tessa title=The Illustration Handbook: A guide to the worlds greatest illustrators year=2012 publisher=Oceana isbn=978-1-84573-473-2 page =307}}</ref>

In the mid-1960s he took a job at the Daily Mail following a Dutch auction for his services with the Daily Express. His decision to work for the Daily Mail led to his estrangement from fellow cartoonist Ralph Steadman, alongside whom he had studied art at East Ham Technical College. Soon after, Steadman was commissioned to illustrate Scarfe and "produced an image that was half saint and half Superman, but with a disconnected heart".<ref>{{Cite book url=http://www.cartoons.ac.uk/artists/ralphsteadman/biography title=Ralph Steadman type=biography series=British Cartoon Archive publisher=University of Kent}}.</ref> Scarfe spent only one year working for the Daily Mail, during which time he was sent to provide illustrations from the Vietnam War.

===Pink Floyd and Roger Waters===
Scarfe was approached to work with Pink Floyd after Roger Waters and Nick Mason both saw his animated BBC film A Long Drawn Out Trip. Pink Floyds 1974 programme for their tour in the UK and US, in the form of a comic, included a centre-spread caricature of the band.<ref name="MM">{{Cite book  publisher = Omnibus  isbn = 0711941092  last1 = Miles  first1 = Barry  last2 = Mabbett  first2 = Andy  title = Pink Floyd - The Visual Documentary  location = London  date = 1994}}</ref> Scarfe later produced a set of animated short clips used on the 1977 In the Flesh (1977 Pink Floyd Animals tour) In The Flesh tour, including a full-length music video for the song Welcome to the Machine.<ref>{{Cite journal url=http://www.rogerwaters.org/22/scarfeint.html title=A Long Drawn-Out Trip: An Interview with Gerald Scarfe first=Michael last=Simone journal=REG Magazine issue=22}}.</ref>

Scarfe also drew the illustrations for their 1979 album The Wall and provided animation for the subsequent The Wall Tour (1980-1981) 1980-1981 concert tour in support of that album.<ref name="MM" /> In 1982, he worked on the Pink Floyd—The Wall film version of The Wall, although he and Roger Waters fell out with director Alan Parker during the latter stages of editing.<ref name="Mabbett3">{{Cite book  publisher = Omnibus  isbn = 9781849383707  last = Mabbett  first = Andy  title = Pink Floyd - The Music and the Mystery  location = London  date = 2010}}</ref> As well as the artwork, Scarfe contributed 15 minutes worth of elaborate animation to the film, including a sequence depicting The Blitz the German bombing campaign over England during World War II, set to the song "Goodbye Blue Sky". Some of the animated footage was not original to the film, having been produced for and used in the 1980-81 concert tour, as well as being featured in the 1979 music video for "Another Brick in the Wall Another Brick in the Wall: Part 2".{{citation needed date=June 2014}}

Scarfe continued to work with Roger Waters after the latter left Pink Floyd, creating the graphics and animation for Waters solo album The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984) and its supporting tour.<ref name="Mabbett3" /> Scarfe was also involved in subsequent theatrical adaptations of The Wall, including The Wall Concert in Berlin (1990),<ref name="Mabbett3" /> and Waters worldwide The Wall Live (2010-2013) tour, where his animations were projected on a vast scale. Scarfes collaboration with Waters was marked in 2008 by the release of a signed limited-edition eight-print series, "Scarfe on the Wall", which contained a monograph book with an extended new interview with Scarfe and was signed by Roger Waters. Early editions of "Scarfe on The Wall" (by date of pre-order, not issue number) came with an additional print giving a total of nine in the set - making these the rarest and most valuable sets. In 2010, Scarfes book The Making of Pink Floyd: The Wall was published, detailing the artists work with Pink Floyd and Roger Waters from 1974-2010. The book contains contributions from Floyd members Roger Waters, Nick Mason, and David Gilmour, as well as director of the film, Alan Parker.{{citation needed date=June 2014}}
