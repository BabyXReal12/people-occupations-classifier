==Personal life==
Jim Davis was born in Marion, Indiana on July 28, 1945.
Davis grew up on a small farm in Fairmount, Indiana, with his father James William "Jim" Davis, mother Anna Catherine "Betty" (née Carter) Davis, brother Dave and 25 cats. Daviss childhood on a farm parallels the life of Garfields owner, Jon Arbuckle, who was also raised on a farm with his parents and a brother, Doc Boy. Jon is a cartoonist, who also celebrates his birthday on July 28. Davis attended Ball State University where he studied art and business. While attending Ball State, he became a member of the Theta Xi Fraternities and sororities fraternity.

Unlike the bachelor, Jon Arbuckle, Davis has been married twice, first to Carolyn (Altekruse), who was allergic to cats,
though they owned a dog named Molly.
They have a son, James Alexander Davis.
On July 16, 2000, Davis married his current wife, Jill, and had two more children: Ashley and Christopher.
In the fall of 2016 Jim Davis joined the faculty of Ball State University in Muncie as an adjunct professor.

Davis resides in Albany, Indiana, where he and his staff produce Garfield under his Paws, Inc. company, launched in 1981. Paws, Inc. employs nearly 50 artists and licensing administrators, who work with agents around the world managing Garfields vast licensing, syndication, and entertainment empire.

Davis is a former president of the Fairmount, Indiana National FFA Organization FFA chapter.
==Career==
Prior to creating Garfield, Davis worked for an advertising agency, and in 1969, he began assisting Tom Ryans comic strip, Tumbleweeds (comic strip) Tumbleweeds. He then created a comic strip, Gnorm Gnat, that ran for five years in The Pendleton Times, an Indiana newspaper. When Davis attempted to sell it to a national comic strip syndicate, an editor told him: "Your art is good, your gags are great, but bugs—nobody can relate to bugs!"
On June 19, 1978, Garfield started syndication in 41 newspapers. Today it is syndicated in 2,580 newspapers and is read by approximately 300 million readers every day.
In the 1980s, Davis created the barnyard slapstick comic strip U.S. Acres. Outside the U.S., the strip was known as Orsons Farm. Davis, along with Brett Koth, also made a 2000–03 strip based on the Mr. Potato Head toy.

Davis founded the Professor Garfield Foundation to support childrens literacy.
His influences include Mort Walkers Beetle Bailey and Hi and Lois, Charles M. Schulzs Peanuts, Milton Caniffs Steve Canyon and Johnny Harts B.C. (comic strip) B.C.
