==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Wally Wood was born in Menahga, Minnesota, and he began reading and drawing comics at an early age. He was strongly influenced by the art styles of Alex Raymonds Flash Gordon, Milton Caniffs Terry and the Pirates (comic strip) Terry and the Pirates, Hal Fosters Prince Valiant, Will Eisners The Spirit and especially Roy Cranes Wash Tubbs. Recalling his childhood, Wood said that his dream at age six, about finding a magic pencil that could draw anything, foretold his future as an artist.<ref name=grain/>
Wood graduated from high school in 1944, signed on with the United States Merchant Marine at the close of World War II and enlisted in the United States Army U.S. Armys 11th Airborne Division (United States) 11th Airborne Division in 1946. He went from training at Fort Benning, Georgia (U.S. state) Georgia, to Occupation of Japan occupied Japan, where he was assigned to the island of Hokkaidō.

In 1947, at age 20, Wood enrolled in the Minneapolis School of Art but only lasted one term.<ref name="McLauchlin" /> Arriving in New York City with his brother Glenn and mother Alma (of Finnish Americans Finnish<ref>David Saunders: [http://www.pulpartists.com/Wood.html WALLY WOOD]</ref> descent), after his military discharge in July 1948, Wood found employment at Bickfords (restaurant) Bickfords restaurant as a busboy. During his time off he carried his thick portfolio of drawings all over midtown Manhattan, visiting every publisher he could find. He briefly attended the Hogarth School of Art but dropped out after one semester.

By October, after being rejected by every company he visited, Wood met fellow artist John Severin in the waiting room of a small publisher. After the two shared their experiences attempting to find work, Severin invited Wood to visit his studio, the Charles William Harvey Studio, where Wood met Charlie Stern, Harvey Kurtzman (who was working for Timely/Marvel) and Will Elder. At this studio Wood learned that Will Eisner was looking for a Spirit background artist. He immediately visited Eisner and was hired on the spot.

Over the next year, Wood also became an assistant to George Wunder, who had taken over the Milton Caniff strip Terry and the Pirates. Wood cited his "first job on my own" as Chief Ob-stacle, a continuing series of strips for a 1949 political newsletter. He entered the comic book field by letterer lettering, as he recalled in 1981: "The first professional job was lettering for Fox Feature Syndicate Fox Romance comics in the United States (1946–1975) romance comics in 1948. This lasted about a year. I also started doing backgrounds, then inker inking. Most of it was the romance stuff. For complete pages, it was $5 a page... Twice a week, I would ink ten pages in one day".<ref>Wally Wood interview, originally published in The Buyers Guide No. 403 (August 1, 1981), reprinted in Comic Book Artist No. 14 (July 2001); p. 18 of the latter.</ref>

Artists representative Renaldo Epworth helped Wood land his early comic-book assignments, making it unclear if that connection led to Woods lettering or to his comics-art debut, the ten-page story "The Tip Off Woman" [sic] in the Fox Comics Western comics Western Women Outlaws No. 4 (cover-dated January 1949, on sale late 1948). Woods next known comic-book art did not appear until Foxs My Confession No. 7 (August 1949), at which time he began working almost continuously on the companys similar My Experience, My Secret Life, My Love Story and My True Love: Thrilling Confession Stories. His first signed work is believed to be in My Confession #8 (October 1949), with the name "Woody" half-hidden on a theater marquee (sign) marquee. He penciled and inked two stories in that issue: "I Was Unwanted" (nine pages) and "My Tarnished Reputation" (ten pages).

Wood began at EC co-penciling and co-inking with Harry Harrison (writer) Harry Harrison the story "Too Busy For Love" (Modern Love #5), and fully penciling the lead story, "I Was Just a Playtime Cowgirl", in Saddle Romances No. 11 (April 1950), inked by Harrison.<ref name="GCD">{{gcdb type=credit search= Wallace+Wood title= Wallace Wood}} and {{gcdb type=credit search= Wally+Wood title= Wally Wood}}</ref>

===1950s===
Working from a Manhattan studio at West 64th Street and Columbus Avenue, Wood began to attract attention in 1950 with his  science-fiction artwork for EC and Avon (publishers) Avon Comics, some in collaboration with Joe Orlando. During this period, he drew in a wide variety of subjects and genres, including adventure, romance, war and horror fiction horror; message stories (for ECs Shock SuspenStories); and eventually satire satirical humor for writer/editor Harvey Kurtzman in Mad (magazine) Mad including a satire of the National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications lawsuit Supermans publisher DC Comics DC filed against Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Captain Marvels publisher Fawcett Comics Fawcett called "Superduperman!" battling Captain Marbles.<ref>{{cite book last = Daniels first = Les authorlink = Les Daniels chapter= The Comics Code Crunch title = DC Comics: Sixty Years of the Worlds Favorite Comic Book Heroes publisher = Little, Brown and Company Bulfinch Press year = 1995 location= New York, New York page = 115 isbn = 0821220764 quote= In the fourth issue [of Mad] (April–May 1953), writer Harvey Kurtzman and artist Wallace Wood make light of the lawsuit between Superman and Captain Marvel.}}</ref>

Wood was instrumental in convincing EC publisher William Gaines to start a line of science fiction comics, Weird Science (comic) Weird Science and Weird Fantasy (later combined under the single title Weird Science-Fantasy).  Wood penciled and inked several dozen EC science fiction stories. Wood also had frequent entries in Two-Fisted Tales and Tales from the Crypt (comic) Tales from the Crypt, as well as the later EC titles Valor (EC Comics) Valor, Piracy (comics) Piracy, and Aces High (comics) Aces High.<ref name="GCD" />

Working over scripts and pencil breakdowns by Jules Feiffer, the 25-year-old Wood drew two months of Will Eisners  Sunday-supplement newspaper comic book The Spirit, on the 1952 story arc "The Spirit in Outer Space". Eisner, Wood recalled, paid him "about $30 a week for lettering and backgrounds on The Spirit. Sometimes he paid $40 when I did the drawings, too".<ref>Wood interview, Comic Book Artist No. 14, p. 19</ref>

Feiffer, in 2010, recalled Woods studio, "which was at that time in the very slummy Upper West Side [of Manhattan] in the [West] 60s, years before it was [the] Lincoln Center [area]. It was a cartoonist and science-fiction writers ghetto – just a huge room where the walls were knocked down, dark, smelly, roach-infested, and all these cartoonists and writers bent over their tables. One was [science-fiction writer] Harry Harrison (writer) Harry Harrison."<ref>Transcript of March 24, 2010, Feiffer interview at the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art, published as [http://filmfestivaltraveler.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=705%3Ajules-feiffer-qa&catid=31%3Ageneral&limitstart=1 "Backing into Jules Feiffer: An Exclusive Q&A"], p.2, FilmFestivalTraveler.com, April 18, 2010.

Between 1957 and 1967, Wood produced both covers and interiors for more than 60 issues of the science-fiction digest Galaxy Science Fiction, illustrating such authors as Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, Jack Finney, Cyril M. Kornbluth C.M. Kornbluth, Frederik Pohl, Robert Silverberg, Robert Sheckley, Clifford D. Simak and Jack Vance. He painted six covers for Galaxy Science Fiction Novels between 1952 and 1958. His gag cartoons appeared in the Mens adventure mens magazines Dude, Gent and Nugget. He inker inked the first eight months of the 1958–1961 syndicated comic strip Sky Masters of the Space Force, penciled by Jack Kirby.<ref>{{cite book last= Evanier first= Mark title= Kirby: King of Comics publisher= Abrams Books year= 2008 location= New York, New York page= 106 isbn= 978-0810994478 quote= The artwork was exquisite, in no small part because Dave Wood had the idea to hire Wally Wood (no relation) to handle the inking.}}</ref>

In circles concerned with copyright and intellectual property issues, Wood is known as the artist of the unsigned satire satirical The Disneyland Memorial Orgy Disneyland Memorial Orgy poster, which first appeared in Paul Krassners magazine The Realist.<ref>Krassner, Paul, and Wally Wood [http://www.ep.tc/realist/74/12.html "The Disneyland Memorial Orgy"], The Realist Archive Project: The Realist #74, May 1967, pp. 12–13.

Wood himself, as late as 1981, when asked who did that drawing, said only, "Id rather not say anything about that! It was the most pirated drawing in history! Everyone was printing copies of that. I understand some people got busted for selling it. I always thought Disney stuff was pretty sexy... Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film) Snow White, etc."<ref>Comic Book Artist No. 14, p. 20</ref> Disney took no legal action against either Krassner or The Realist but did sue a publisher of a "blacklight" version of the poster, who used the image without Krassners permission. The case was settled out of court.

===Publisher===
In 1966, Wood launched the independent magazine witzend (originally to be titled et cetera, a name which had to be withdrawn when Wood was told another magazine had already used this) one of the first alternative comics, a decade before Mike Friedrichs Star Reach or Flo Steinbergs Big Apple Comix for which Wood drew the cover and contributed a story. Wood offered his fellow professionals the opportunity to contribute illustrations and graphic stories that detoured from the usual conventions of the comics industry. After the fourth issue, Wood turned witzend over to Bill Pearson (American writer) Bill Pearson, who continued as editor and publisher through the 1970s and into the 1980s.
Wood additionally collected his feature Sally Forth (Wally Wood) Sally Forth, published in the U.S. servicemens periodicals Military News and Overseas Weekly in 1968–1974, in a series of four oversize (10"x12") magazines. Pearson, in 1993–95, reformatted the strips into a series of comics published by Eros Comix, an imprint of Fantagraphics Books, which in 1998 collected the entire run into a single 160-page volume.<ref>{{cite web url= http://www.toonopedia.com/sallyf-1.htm title= Sally Forth first= Don last= Markstein year= 2007 publisher= Don Marksteins Toonopedia archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6QVojvPxN?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/sallyf-1.htm archivedate= June 22, 2014 deadurl= no df= mdy-all}}</ref>

In 1969, Wood created another independent comic, Heroes, Inc. Presents Cannon, intended for his "Sally Forth" military readership as indicated in the ads and indicia. Artists Steve Ditko and Ralph Reese and writer Ron Whyte are credited with primary writer-artist Wood on three features: "Cannon", "The Misfits",<ref>[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/misfitsww.htm Wally Woods "Misfits"] at An International Catalogue of Superheroes.[https://www.webcitation.org/5xpKTuaW5?url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/misfitsww.htm WebCitation archive].</ref> and "Dragonella". A second magazine-format issue was published in 1976 by Wood and CPL Gang Publications. Larry Hama, one of Woods assistants, said, "I did script about three Sally Forth stories and a few of the Cannons. I wrote the main Sally Forth story in the first reprint book, which is actually dedicated to me, mostly because I lent Woody the money to publish it".<ref>[http://joeguide.com/hama/artist.shtml JoeGuide.com: "Larry Hama: Writer & Artist"], no date. Original link dead as of at least February 4, 2010. {{webarchive  url=https://web.archive.org/web/19960101/http://joeguide.com/hama/artist.shtml  date=January 1, 1996 }}.</ref>

In 1980 and 1981, Wood did two issues of a completely pornographic comic book, titled Gang Bang. It featured two sexually explicit Sally Forth stories, and sexually explicit versions of Disneys Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film) Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, titled So White and the Six Dorks; Terry and the Pirates (comic strip) Terry and The Pirates, titled Perry and the Privates; Prince Valiant, titled Prince Violate; Superman and Wonder Woman, titled Stuporman Meets Blunder Woman; Flash Gordon, titled Flasher Gordon; and Tarzan titled Starzan. A third volume, published in 1983, contained three more sexually explicit parodies of Alice in Wonderland, titled Malice in Blunderland; a second Flash Gordon sendup titled Flesh Fucker Meets Womens Lib!; and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz The Wizard of Oz, titled The Blizzard of Ooze.

=== "Panels That Always Work" ===
Wood struggled to be as efficient as possible in the often low-paying comics industry.<ref name="Evanier">{{cite web  url= http://www.newsfromme.com/2010/07/02/todays-video-link-158/ title= Todays Video Link first= Mark last= Evanier date= July 2, 2010  publisher= News From ME archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140625004310/http://www.newsfromme.com/2010/07/02/todays-video-link-158/ archivedate=June 25, 2014  deadurl= no df=mdy-all}}</ref> Over time he created a series of layout techniques sketched on pieces of paper which he taped up near his drawing table.

a creation using the motif of one of them, depicting Daredevil and Wood himself, in Wally Wood style – and the Wally Wood Estates official print of the panels.

===Personal life and final years===
Wood was married three times. His first marriage was to artist Tatjana Wood, who later did extensive work as a comic-book colorist. Their marriage ended in the late 1960s. His second marriage, to Marilyn Silver, also ended in divorce.<ref name="McLauchlin">{{cite journal last= McLauchlin first= Jim title= Tragic Genius: Wally Wood journal= Wizard (magazine) Wizard issue= 228 pages =  date = July 2010 url= http://heroinitiative.blogspot.com/2010/06/tragic-genius-wally-wood.html archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232423/http://heroinitiative.blogspot.com/2010/06/tragic-genius-wally-wood.html archivedate= December 30, 2013 deadurl= no df=mdy-all}}</ref>


For much of his adult life, Wood suffered from chronic, unexplainable headaches. In the 1970s, following bouts with alcoholism, Wood suffered from kidney failure. A stroke in 1978 caused a loss of Visual perception vision in one eye. Faced with declining health and career prospects, he committed suicide by gunshot in Los Angeles on 
November 2, 1981.<ref name=Lambiek/><ref name="McLauchlin"/> Toward the end of his life, an embittered Wood would say, according to one biography, "If I had it all to do over again, Id cut off my hands."<ref>{{cite book title=Against the Grain: MAD Artist Wallace Wood first=Bhob, ed.<!--sp POK-->   last=Stewart publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing  year=2003 location= Raleigh, North Carolina isbn=978-1-893905-23-8 page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=D3Up5Fqyc6MC&pg=PA321&lpg=PA321&dq=“If+I+had+it+all+to+do+over+again,+I’d+cut+off+my+hands.”&source=bl&ots=QkstDtD7l_&sig=7P80aTdolEk6y0ejxTH-naT6Yzk&hl=en&ei=hBOoTs_CM6Hf0QHQ1tmBDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=“If%20I%20had%20it%20all%20to%20do%20over%20again%2C%20I’d%20cut%20off%20my%20hands.”&f=false 321]}}</ref>

In 1972, EC Comics EC editor Harvey Kurtzman, who worked closely with Wood during the 1950s, said:
{{blockquote Wally had a tension in him, an intensity that he locked away in an internal steam boiler. I think it ate away his insides, and the work really used him up. I think he delivered some of the finest work that was ever drawn, and I think its to his credit that he put so much intensity into his work at great sacrifice to himself.<ref>EC Lives!
