== Biography ==
Born in Chicago, Illinois, he grew up in the tenements and worked as a newsboy, quitting when a tough guy muscled in on his corner. At age 15, he traveled the midwest, finding employment with a foot surgeon, selling baking powder, patented eggbeaters and pictures, plus working as a medicine show barker in a street carnival. As he recalled, he left "to work on and at such things as selling enlarged pictures, soliciting for a corn doctor, and for one delirious season carrying on with a medicine show. I would not mention these things except that I feel what may be a pardonable pride in their diversity."{{cn date=August 2018}}

During his late teens, he settled in St. Louis, Missouri, where he was employed for $10 a week as a foreman at the St. Louis Dairy, where he washed milk cans for seven years.<ref name=lam>[http://lambiek.net/artists/t/tuthill_hj.htm "Harry J.

By the age of 30, he still had not sold any cartoons. Finding encouragement on his artwork from Bob Grable of World Color Press World Color Printing, he worked for the St. Louis Star and then moved to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He took night classes at Washington University, studying engineering and art, and signed on as a full-time cartoonist with the St. Louis Star during World War I, doing a strip titled Lafe about a lazy handyman, and attracting national attention for his editorial cartoons.

In 1918, Tuthill launched Home Sweet Home, a strip about apartment life, in the New York Evening Mail.<ref name=lam/><ref name=rick>Marschall, Rick. "Harry J. Tuthill", Nemo, the Classic Comics Library 5 (February 1984)</ref> During the six-year run, it introduced George and Josephine Bungle, and he retitled it as The Bungle Family in 1924. Distributed initially by the McClure Syndicate and later by the McNaught Syndicate, the strip was carried by 120 newspapers. Comics historian Rick Marschall praised Tuthills work, "Seldom has there been a strip (Moon Mullins comes to mind) registering a sustained, masterful indictment of petite-bourgeois sensibilities and preoccupations as did The Bungle Family."<ref name=rick/>

He also drew Alice and Her Bothersome Little Brother and Napoleon Blunder during the 1920s. Little Brother ran as a topper (comic strip) topper strip to The Bungle Family. Tuthill’s strips from 1919 to 1926 were created in his home studio at 4537 Tower Grove Place in St. Louis, eventually moving to Ferguson, Missouri outside St. Louis.<ref>{{cite journal last=Heintjes first=Tom date=August 12, 2013 title=When the Bungles Mixed It Up with Their Neighbors on the Battlegrounds of Sunken Heights publisher=Hogans Alley (magazine) Hogans Alley issue=13 url=http://cartoonician.com/when-the-bungles-mixed-it-up-with-their-neighbors-on-the-battlegrounds-of-sunken-heights/}}</ref> His sister, Irene Morrisson, also lived in the St. Louis area.

Tuthill continued to draw The Bungle Family for McNaught until he had a dispute with the syndicate in 1939, which no longer carried the strip in 1942. After a hiatus, the strip returned — syndicated by Tuthill himself — on May 16, 1943, with newspapers running a promotional banner, "The Bungles Are Back!" It ran for two more years until 1945 when Tuthill retired. 

He died of heart disease in 1957.<ref name=lam/><ref name=rick/>
