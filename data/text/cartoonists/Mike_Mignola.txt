===Hellboy and related spin-offs===
{{main article Hellboy Universe}}

====Hellboy====

Though he wrote the story himself, it was scripted by John Byrne (comics) John Byrne. The next Hellboy story, Hellboy: The Chained Coffin and Others#The Wolves of Saint August The Wolves of Saint August, was completely written and drawn by Mike Mignola. Since then all Hellboy stories have been written solely by Mike Mignola with the exception of Hellboy: The Crooked Man and Others#They That Go Down to the Sea in Ships They That Go Down to the Sea in Ships which was co-written by Joshua Dysart.

Hellboy: The Troll Witch and Others#Makoma Makoma (2006) was the first Hellboy story not drawn by Mignola, featuring the art of  Richard Corben. Corben would return to draw many flashback stories for the series. Other artists have also had a hand in drawing flashback stories including Jason Shawn Alexander, Kevin Nowlan and Scott Hampton. In 2007, following after 2005s Hellboy: Strange Places#The Island The Island, British artist Duncan Fegredo took over art duties on the ongoing story arc of Hellboy from Hellboy: Darkness Calls Darkness Calls onwards.

Mike Mignola returned as the full-time artist for Hellboy in 2012 for the ongoing series, Hellboy in Hell. The series is currently published sporadically, but multiple-issue stories are monthly.<ref>{{cite web last=Khouri  first=Andy  title=Hellboy in Hell is the Comic Mike Mignola Will Be Drawing for the Rest of His Life  url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2012/12/14/hellboy-in-hell-mike-mignola-interview/  date=December 14, 2012  publisher=Comics Alliance  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108130929/http://comicsalliance.com/hellboy-in-hell-mike-mignola-interview/  archivedate=November 8, 2013  deadurl=yes  accessdate=March 15, 2013 df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====Abe Sapien====

Abe Sapien did not take off properly until a decade later in 2008s The Drowning. Since then it has had several short stories and beginning in 2013 it became an ongoing series with Scott Allie as the lead writer with Mignola.<ref>{{cite web last=Salvatore first=Brian title=Talkin’ Abe Sapien with Scott Allie url=http://multiversitycomics.com/interviews/mignolaversity-talkin-abe-sapien-with-scott-allie-interview/ date= March 1, 2013 archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131102020721/http://multiversitycomics.com/interviews/mignolaversity-talkin-abe-sapien-with-scott-allie-interview/ archivedate= November 2, 2013 deadurl= no df=mdy-all accessdate=March 15, 2013}}</ref>

====B.P.R.D.====
B.P.R.D.#Publication History B.P.R.D. was the third spin-off, but it was the first one which was conceived to be more than just a one-off side story, but rather a series of stories.<ref name="Introduction by Scott Allie">{{cite book last=Mignola first=Mike title=B.P.R.D.: Plague of Frogs - Volume 1 year=2011 publisher=Dark Horse Comics isbn=978-1-59582-609-1 chapter= Introduction by Scott Allie url=http://www.darkhorse.com/Books/17-169/B-P-R-D-Plague-of-Frogs-Hardcover-Collection-Vol-1}}</ref> It began with 2002s B.P.R.D.: Hollow Earth and Other Stories Hollow Earth, which continued on from Hellboy: Conqueror Worm. Beyond that followed a series of short stories designed to explore what the B.P.R.D. series could be. 2004s B.P.R.D.: Plague of Frogs Plague of Frogs was the story that solidified what the series was, and would set the direction for future books to come, so much so that the first major story cycle is collected in omnibus editions titled B.P.R.D.: Plague of Frogs. A vast majority of the stories in this era were co-written with John Arcudi and drawn by Guy Davis (comics) Guy Davis.

====B.P.R.D.: Hell on Earth====
B.P.R.D.#B.P.R.D. Hell on Earth Trade Paperbacks B.P.R.D.: Hell on Earth is the main series continuing after the catastrophic events at the conclusion of the Plague of Frogs cycle.

Tyler Crook became the new ongoing artist beginning with Hell on Earth: Monsters, but he is joined by several regular artists, most notably James Harren and Laurence Campbell.

====B.P.R.D.: The Devil You Know====
Continuing on where Hell on Earth left off, The Devil You Know is written by Mike Mignola and Scott Allie with Laurence Campbell serving as the regular artist.

====Sir Edward Grey, Witchfinder====
Hellboy Universe#Sir Edward Grey.2C Witchfinder Sir Edward Grey, Witchfinder (more commonly known simply as "Witchfinder") began with a teaser story in 2008s Dark Horse Presents#Second incarnation: MDHP MySpace Dark Horse Presents #16, followed by a full miniseries in 2009. It follows the stories of the occult investigator, Sir Edward, agent of Queen Victoria.

====Spin-off miniseries====
