{{main article Hellboy Universe}}

====Hellboy====
Prior to 1994 Mignola had done work-for-hire illustration. That year, Dark Horse Comics released Hellboy: Seed of Destruction, Mignolas Creator ownership creator-owned project. Though he wrote the story himself, it was scripted by John Byrne (comics) John Byrne. The next Hellboy story, Hellboy: The Chained Coffin and Others#The Wolves of Saint August The Wolves of Saint August, was completely written and drawn by Mike Mignola. Since then all Hellboy stories have been written solely by Mike Mignola with the exception of Hellboy: The Crooked Man and Others#They That Go Down to the Sea in Ships They That Go Down to the Sea in Ships which was co-written by Joshua Dysart.

Hellboy: The Troll Witch and Others#Makoma Makoma (2006) was the first Hellboy story not drawn by Mignola, featuring the art of  Richard Corben. Corben would return to draw many flashback stories for the series. Other artists have also had a hand in drawing flashback stories including Jason Shawn Alexander, Kevin Nowlan and Scott Hampton. In 2007, following after 2005s Hellboy: Strange Places#The Island The Island, British artist Duncan Fegredo took over art duties on the ongoing story arc of Hellboy from Hellboy: Darkness Calls Darkness Calls onwards.

Mike Mignola returned as the full-time artist for Hellboy in 2012 for the ongoing series, Hellboy in Hell. The series is currently published sporadically, but multiple-issue stories are monthly.
====Abe Sapien====
In 1998 the first Hellboy spin-off, Abe Sapien#Publication History Abe Sapien, was launched. It was not written by Mike Mignola, but it did feature his Hellboy short story "Hellboy: The Right Hand of Doom#Heads Heads" as a back-up. Abe Sapien did not take off properly until a decade later in 2008s The Drowning. Since then it has had several short stories and beginning in 2013 it became an ongoing series with Scott Allie as the lead writer with Mignola.
====Lobster Johnson====
Lobster Johnson was the next spin-off, debuting as a back-up feature in 1999s Hellboy: The Right Hand of Doom#Box Full of Evil Box Full of Evil. The series got its own title later in 2007s Lobster Johnson: The Iron Prometheus. It returned again with the Limited series (comics) miniseries The Burning Hand in 2012, followed by various short stories.

====B.P.R.D.====
B.P.R.D.#Publication History B.P.R.D. was the third spin-off, but it was the first one which was conceived to be more than just a one-off side story, but rather a series of stories.
It began with 2002s B.P.R.D.: Hollow Earth and Other Stories Hollow Earth, which continued on from Hellboy: Conqueror Worm. Beyond that followed a series of short stories designed to explore what the B.P.R.D. series could be. 2004s B.P.R.D.: Plague of Frogs Plague of Frogs was the story that solidified what the series was, and would set the direction for future books to come, so much so that the first major story cycle is collected in omnibus editions titled B.P.R.D.: Plague of Frogs. A vast majority of the stories in this era were co-written with John Arcudi and drawn by Guy Davis (comics) Guy Davis.

====B.P.R.D.: Hell on Earth====
B.P.R.D.#B.P.R.D. Hell on Earth Trade Paperbacks B.P.R.D.: Hell on Earth is the main series continuing after the catastrophic events at the conclusion of the Plague of Frogs cycle. Guy Davis left the series in 2011 with the conclusion of Hell on Earth: Gods. Tyler Crook became the new ongoing artist beginning with Hell on Earth: Monsters, but he is joined by several regular artists, most notably James Harren and Laurence Campbell.

====B.P.R.D.: The Devil You Know====
Continuing on where Hell on Earth left off, The Devil You Know is written by Mike Mignola and Scott Allie with Laurence Campbell serving as the regular artist.

====Sir Edward Grey, Witchfinder====
Hellboy Universe#Sir Edward Grey.2C Witchfinder Sir Edward Grey, Witchfinder (more commonly known simply as "Witchfinder") began with a teaser story in 2008s Dark Horse Presents#Second incarnation: MDHP MySpace Dark Horse Presents #16, followed by a full miniseries in 2009. It follows the stories of the occult investigator, Sir Edward, agent of Queen Victoria.

====Spin-off miniseries====
The Hellboy Universe also includes numerous spin-offs that only span a single book:
* Sledgehammer 44: Set in World War II, this series is about the Epimetheus Vril Energy Suit created by Doctor Helena Gallargas.
* Frankenstein Underground: Set in 1956, this series follows the Frankenstein monster as he ventures into the Pellucidar Pellucidar-like Hollow Earth.
* Rise of the Black Flame: Set in 1923, this series explores how Raimund Diestel became the Black Flame.
* The Visitor: How &amp; Why He Stayed: This series follows the life of an alien visitor set to kill the infant Hellboy in 1944.
* Rasputin: The Voice of the Dragon: Set in 1941, this series follows Trevor Bruttenholm as he becomes a agent for the allied forces in World war II.
* Koshchei the Deathless: Hellboy and Koshchei sit in a pub in Hell and chat.

===Baltimore===
Baltimore (novel and comic series) Baltimore is a series begun with a Baltimore, or The Steadfast Tin Soldier and the Vampire 2007 illustrated novel, and continued as a comic book series. It was created by Mike Mignola and Christopher Golden.

===Joe Golem: Occult Detective===
Like Baltimore, Joe Golem: Occult Detective began as an illustrated prose novel  (2012s Joe Golem and the Drowning City) and later continued as a comic book series. It was created by Mike Mignola and Christopher Golden and exists in a shared universe with Baltimore.

==Style==
Alan Moore has described Mignolas style as "German expressionism meets Jack Kirby".
His style has also been likened to an amalgamation of Jack Kirby and Alex Toth.
==Film and television==
Mignola worked as an illustrator for Francis Ford Coppolas 1992 movie Bram Stokers Dracula. He was also the production designer for the The Walt Disney Company Disney feature film, Atlantis: The Lost Empire in 2001, and was a concept artist for 2002s Blade II, also directed by del Toro, and a concept artist for Pixars Brave (2012 film) Brave.

Mignola was hired by Bruce Timm to provide character designs for Batman: The Animated Series in 1991. His redesign of Mr. Freeze was used for the series.
Mignolas design of the 1880s Batman costume from the comic Batman: Gotham by Gaslight appeared in Batman: The Brave and the Bold.

Hellboy was made into a Hellboy (2004 film) feature film in 2004 by director Guillermo del Toro. Mignola was closely involved with the movies production, and a Hellboy II: The Golden Army sequel was released in 2008. Hellboy has been made into two direct-to-video animated films, Hellboy: Sword of Storms Sword of Storms in 2006 and Hellboy: Blood and Iron Blood and Iron in 2007.

Mignolas The Amazing Screw-On Head debuted in 2006 on the Syfy Sci-Fi Channel, starring the voices of Paul Giamatti and David Hyde Pierce.

In May 2017 it was announced that Mignola will co-write the script for Hellboy: Rise of the Blood Queen, an R-rated reboot film that will be directed by Neil Marshall and star David Harbour as Hellboy.
In March 2018 TSG Entertainment, makers of the 2017 film The Shape of Water, approached Mignola to make the The Shape of Water Amphibian Man part of the Hellboy universe. Mignola said that he currently has no plans to do it.
