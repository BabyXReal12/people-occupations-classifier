Erik J. Larsen (born December 8, 1962) is an United States American comic book writer, artist and publisher. He is known for his work on Savage Dragon, as one of the founders of Image Comics, and for his work on Spider-Man for Marvel Comics.

==Early life==
Larsen was born on December 8, 1962,<ref>[http://cbgxtra.com/comics-news-and-notes/todays-comics-guide-november-24-2011 "Today’s Comics Guide: November 24, 2011: Birthdays 2 Weeks from Now"]. CBGXtra.

Savage Dragon.com. Retrieved November 4, 2012.</ref> As a child growing up in Bellingham, Washington, and Albion, California, he created several comic books featuring versions of a character named "The Dragon", whom he has since described as a Batman-like character who drove a car copied from Speed Racers Mach Five. The Dragon turned into a superhero using a magic word to trigger his powers like Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Captain Marvel. Larsen and two friends produced a fanzine called Graphic Fantasy, which featured this character.

==Career==
Larsens first paid work was for the anthology Megaton, co-creating and illustrating a feature called "Vanguard" with publisher Gary Carlson.  A revised version of the Dragon debuted in issue #2 and appeared in the following two issues. The original Dragon, inspired by elements from Captain Marvel, Batman, Speed Racer and later The Incredible Hulk,{{citation needed date=October 2011}} differs greatly from the modern incarnation.

Savage Dragon was first featured in two issues of Graphic Fantasy, a self-published title with a small print run, published by Larsen and two friends. In this incarnation, the Dragon was a widower and a retired member of a government-sponsored superhero team. Subsequently, the Dragon made another appearance in the third issue of Gary Carlsons Megaton anthology in its Vanguard strip, which Larsen had been drawing. In these appearances, the character of the Dragon remained basically the same as it had been in Graphic Fantasy, with a few details modified (such as the inclusion of his wife, who was dead in his previous incarnation). Both the Graphic Fantasy and Megaton issues featuring the Dragon have since been reprinted in high-quality editions.

Larsen went on to work for AC Comics on Sentinels of Justice and The DNAgents for Eclipse Comics.

Larsen did work at DC on Outsiders (comics) The Outsiders, Teen Titans, Adventures of Superman (comic book) Adventures of Superman and Doom Patrol. His art on Doom Patrol was negatively received by readers at first, something Larsen thought was due to his style being such a drastic departure from that of his predecessor on the series, Steve Lightle. He remarked, "Years later, I learned from the experience and made more of an effort to ease the transition."<ref>{{cite journal last=Browning first=Michael  title=The Doom Patrol Interviews: Erik Larsen  journal=Back Issue! issue=65 pages=52–54  publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing  date=July 2013 location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> His first work for Marvel Comics was a fill-in on Thor (Marvel Comics) Thor that was inked by Vince Colletta.<ref>Larsen, Erik (May 9, 2008). [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?id=16355&page=article "One Fans Opinion"]. Comic Book Resources.</ref> He later did a The Amazing Spider-Man fill-in story  and five issues of Punisher for Marvel. A Nova (Richard Rider) Nova story for Marvel Comics Presents was greenlit but cancelled because it did not fit with an upcoming New Warriors series that would feature the character.  Though he continues to write and illustrate The Savage Dragon, Larsen has occasionally returned to Marvel to write and illustrate, on titles such as Fantastic Four, The Defenders (comic book) The Defenders, Wolverine (comic book) Wolverine and Nova (Richard Rider) Nova. He has also done work for DC writing Aquaman.

In 1990 Erik Larsen replaced Todd McFarlane on The Amazing Spider-Man with issue #329, having previously penciled issues 287, 324 and 327. With writer David Michelinie, Larsen illustrated stories such as "The Cosmic Spider-Man", "The Return of the Sinister Six" (#334–339) and "The Powerless Spider-Man" (#341–343).  He left the title with #350, was succeeded by Mark Bagley with #351. Larsen again succeeded McFarlane on Peter Parker: Spider-Man Spider-Man, where he wrote and drew the six-issue story arc "Revenge of the Sinister Six" (#18–23).

===Image Comics and Savage Dragon===
In 1992, seeking greater control and profit over the work they created, Larsen and six other illustrators left Marvel to form Image Comics, where Larsen launched a series featuring a reworked version of Savage Dragon. This time, the Dragon was a massively muscled green amnesiac, who joined the Chicago police department after being discovered in a burning field. Initially debuting in a three-issue miniseries, the series met with enough success to justify a monthly series, launched in 1993. To this day, Larsen continues to write and illustrate the series entirely by himself, and has maintained a reasonably consistent monthly schedule (save for occasional lapses) in comparison with the other original Image Comics titles.{{citation needed date=October 2011}} Larsen has occasionally produced ancillary mini-series, and sometimes allowed other creators to produce stories featuring the Dragon or other characters from the series.

In the mid-1990s, Larsen published his titles under Highbrow Entertainment, the label for his imprint of Image Comics. Titles they published included:
* Dart (comics) Dart (1996)
* Deadly Duo (1994–1995)
** Deadly Duo vol. 2 (1995)
* Freak Force (1993–1995)
** Freak Force vol. 2 (1997)
* Dragon: Blood & Guts (1995) 
* Savage Dragon (1992)
** Savage Dragon vol. 2 (1993 – ongoing)
* Savage Dragon/Marshal Law (1997) 
* Savage Dragon: Red Horizon (1997) 
* Savage Dragon: Sex and Violence (1997) 
* Savage Dragon: God War (2004–2005)
* Star (1995)
* SuperPatriot (1993)
** SuperPatriot: Liberty & Justice (1995)
** SuperPatriot: Americas Fighting Force (2002)
** SuperPatriot: War on Terror (2004–2005)
* The Dragon (1996) 
* Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1996–1999)
* Vanguard (Image Comics) Vanguard (1993–1994)
** Vanguard: Strange Visitors (1996–1997)

Reprinted from Comics Buyers Guide #1033. September 3, 1993</ref> The character was also adapted into a short-lived (26 episodes) USA Network animated series that started in 1995.

In 2012–2013, he had a run as writer and artist on a short-lived revival of Rob Liefelds Supreme (comics) Supreme, illustrating writer Alan Moores final unpublished script with issue #63 and writing new stories from issues #64–68.

===Publisher===
In 2004, Larsen became publisher of Image Comics, taking responsibility for all comics produced by creators other than the Image partners and their studios. Larsen stepped down as publisher in July 2008 and executive director Eric Stephenson (comics) Eric Stephenson was promoted to the position.<ref>{{cite web   last1=Brady   first1=Matt   url=https://www.newsarama.com/comics/080710-estephenson.html   title=Eric Stephenson: Talking to the New Image Publisher   publisher=Newsarama   date=8 July 2008}}</ref>

In an interview with Project Fanboy Larsen explained that the rumors of a coup for the position were baseless and gave his reasons for stepping down as publisher:<ref name=Fanboy>Piccione, Sebastian. [http://www.projectfanboy.com/vb/showthread.php?t=1288 "ERIK LARSEN Interview"] Project Fanboy August 12, 2008</ref>

{{quote Fans wanted more Savage Dragon and I wanted to do more Savage Dragon—but it was not possible to be both a fulltime publisher and a fulltime cartoonist efficiently. Something had to give, and given the fact that Image was in a good place—going in the right direction—and Eric Stephenson was completely up to speed and ready to go—it seemed that the timing was right.<ref name=Fanboy/>}}

Larsen stated that Eric Stephenson was chosen as his replacement because "He was Jims second in command and mine as well. He worked with Jim and Rob Liefeld before that. Hes been with Image almost from day one and he lives and breathes comics. He really was the best man for the job."<ref name=Fanboy/>

==Technique and materials==
For penciling, Larsen uses a Staedtler Mars Lumograph 100 2H pencil and a Staedtler Mars Plastic Eraser. For inking, he uses a Hunt 102 nib (pen) nib with Higgens Design ink, a Uni-ball pen, and Pentel Rolling Writer pen.<ref name=OfficialBio/>

==Personal life==
Larsen and his wife, Jannie, live in San Francisco, California, with their two sons, Christopher and Joseph.<ref name=OfficialBio/>

==Awards==
Larsen was nominated for the 2016 Inkwell Awards All-in-One Award, for "Favorite artist known for inking his/ her own pencil work in award year interior, cover-dated, American comic book material."<ref name="Inkwell Awards Winners, 2016">{{cite web url=http://www.inkwellawards.com/?page_id=5352 title=2016 Winners date=30 June 2016 publisher=Inkwell Awards}}</ref> In 2017, he was again nominated and received the 2017 All-in-One Award for his work on Savage Dragon.<ref name=Inkwells2017winners>{{cite web url=http://www.inkwellawards.com/?page_id=5951 title=2017 Winners date=3 July 2017 publisher=Inkwell Awards}}</ref><ref name=newsaramaInkwells2017>{{cite web  url=https://www.newsarama.com/34988-2017-inkwell-award-winners.html title=2017 INKWELL AWARD Winners  publisher=Newsarama date=19 June 2017}}</ref>
