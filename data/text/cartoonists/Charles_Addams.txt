==Biography==

===Life===
Addams was born in Westfield, New Jersey. Son of Grace M. (Spear) (1879-1960) and Charles Huey Addams (1882-1963), a piano-company executive who had studied to be an architect,<ref name=nytimespace /> he was known as "something of a rascal around the neighborhood" as childhood friends recalled.<ref name=maslin/> Addams was distantly related to U.S. presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams, despite the different spellings of their last names, and was a first cousin twice removed to noted social reformer Jane Addams.<ref name=maslin/><ref name="DavisAddams2006">{{cite book last=Davis first=Linda H. title=Chas Addams: a cartoonists life url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bSMRAQAAMAAJ accessdate=2011-10-06 date=24 October 2006 publisher=Random House isbn=978-0-679-46325-2}}</ref>

A house on Elm Street, and another on Dudley Avenue into which police once caught him breaking and entering, are said to be the inspiration for the Addams Family mansion in his cartoons.  College Hall (University of Pennsylvania) College Hall, the oldest building on the current campus of the University of Pennsylvania, where Addams studied, was also an inspiration for the mansion.<ref>{{cite web title= Virtual Tour of Penns Campus: College Hall url=http://www.upenn.edu/admissions/tour/tourstop.php?stop%3D1  accessdate=June 4, 2010  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606051702/http://www.upenn.edu/admissions/tour/tourstop.php?stop=1  archivedate=June 6, 2010 }}</ref> He was fond of visiting the Presbyterian Cemetery on Mountain Avenue.<ref name=maccloskey/> One friend said of him: "His sense of humor was a little different from everybody elses." He was also artistically inclined, "drawing with a happy vengeance," according to a biographer.<ref name=maslin/>

His father encouraged him to draw, and Addams did cartoons for the Westfield High School (New Jersey) Westfield High School student literary magazine, Weathervane.<ref name=nytimespace /><ref name=maccloskey/> He attended Colgate University in 1929 and 1930. At the corners of West Kendrick and Maple Avenues in Hamilton, NY, is another home, and myth, that may have inspired the Addams Family house.<ref>{{cite web title= battle to save Hamilton home. url=http://www.clipsyndicate.com/video/play/7308496/battle_to_save_hamilton_home}}</ref> He also attended the University of Pennsylvania, where a fine-arts building on campus is named for him, in 1930 and 1931. In front of the building is a sculpture of the silhouettes of Addams Family characters<ref name=maccloskey/>, and the library contains a mural which he created in 1952 and depicts prominent Addams Family members<ref>Sketchbook by Charles Addams: The Addams Family Secret{{cite web  last1=Karasik  first1=Paul  title=The Addams Family Secret  url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/09/the-addams-family-secret  website=The New Yorker  publisher=Condé Nast  accessdate=8 July 2018}}</ref>. He then studied at the Grand Central School of Art in New York City in 1931 and 1932.<ref name=nytimespace /><ref name=maccloskey/>

In 1933, Charles Addams joined the layout department of True Detective (magazine) True Detective magazine, where he had to retouch photos of corpses that appeared in the magazines stories to remove the blood from them. Addams complained: "A lot of those corpses were more interesting the way they were."<ref>{{cite web   last = Marr   first = John   url = http://www.stim.com/Stim-x/8.1/detective/detective-08.1.html   title = True Detective R.I.P.   accessdate = 2011-10-06}}</ref>

Addams first drawing for The New Yorker, a sketch of a window washer, ran on February 6, 1932, and his cartoons ran regularly in the magazine from 1938, when he drew the first in the series that came to be called The Addams Family, until his death. He was a freelancer throughout that time.<ref name=maslin/><ref name=maslin/>

During World War II, Addams served at the Kaufman Astoria Studios Signal Corps Photographic Center in New York, where he made animated training films for the U.S. Army. In late 1942, he met his first wife, Barbara Jean Day, who purportedly resembled his cartoon character Morticia Addams.<ref name=maslin /> The marriage ended eight years later, after Addams, who hated small children, refused to adopt one.<ref name=maslin /> She later married New Yorker colleague John Hersey, author of the book Hiroshima (book) Hiroshima.<ref name="DavisAddams2006" />

Addams married his second wife, Barbara Barb (Estelle B. Barb), in 1954. A practicing lawyer, she "combined Morticia-like looks with diabolical legal scheming," by which she wound up controlling The Addams Family television and film franchises and persuaded her husband to give away other legal rights.<ref name=maslin/> At one point, she got her husband to take out a US $100,000 insurance policy. Addams consulted a lawyer on the sly, who later humorously wrote: "I told him the last time I had word of such a move was in a picture called Double Indemnity (film) Double Indemnity starring Barbara Stanwyck, which I called to his attention." In the movie, Stanwycks character plotted her husbands murder.<ref name=maslin/> The couple divorced in 1956.<ref name="DavisAddams2006" />

The Addams Family (1964 TV series) The Addams Family television series began after David Levy,<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/31/news/mn-59571 "David Levy; Producer Created Addams Family"], Los Angeles Times, 31 January 2000</ref> a television producer, approached Addams with an offer to create it with a little help from the humorist. All Addams had to do was give his characters names and more characteristics for the actors to use in portrayals. The series ran on ABC for two seasons, from 1964 to 1966.<ref name=maccloskey/>

Addams was "sociable and debonair". A biographer described him as being "a well-dressed, courtly man with silvery back-combed hair and a gentle manner, he bore no resemblance to a fiend". Figuratively a "wikt:lady-killer ladykiller", Addams accompanied women such as Greta Garbo, Joan Fontaine and Jacqueline Kennedy on social occasions.<ref name=maslin/>

Later, Addams married his third and last wife, Marilyn Matthews Miller, best known as "Tee" (1926&ndash;2002), in a pet cemetery.<ref name=nytimespace /> In 1985, the Addamses moved to Sagaponack, New York, where they named their estate "The Swamp".<ref>{{cite book  title=The Addams Family: An Evilution  title-link=The Addams Family: An Evilution  date=2010  editor-first=H.

===Death===
Addams died on September 29, 1988, at the age of 76, at Saint Clares Hospital (Manhattan) St. Clares Hospital and Health Center in New York City, having suffered a heart attack after parking his automobile.  An ambulance took him from his apartment to the hospital, where he died in the emergency room.<ref name=nytimespace>{{cite news   last=Pace   first=Eric   date=September 30, 1988   title=Charles Addams Dead at 76; Found Humor in the Macabre   work=New York Times   accessdate=October 11, 2009   url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/30/obituaries/charles-addams-dead-at-76-found-humor-in-the-macabre.html}}</ref> As he had requested, a Wake (ceremony) wake was held rather than a funeral; he had wished to be remembered as a "good cartoonist".  He was cremated, and his ashes were buried in the pet cemetery of his estate "The Swamp".<ref name="DavisAddams2006" />{{rp 318}}

===Cartoons===
Addams cartoons regularly appeared in The New Yorker, and he also created a syndicated comic strip, Out of This World, which ran in 1956. There are many collections of his work, including Drawn and Quartered (1942) and Monster Rally (1950), the latter with a foreword by John OHara. Typical of Addams work, one cartoon shows two men standing in a room labeled "Patent Attorney". One is pointing a bizarre gun out the window toward the street and saying: "Death ray, fiddlesticks! Why, it doesnt even slow them up!".

Dear Dead Days (1959) is not a collection of his cartoons (although it reprints a few from previous collections); it is a scrapbook-like compendium of vintage images (and occasional pieces of text) that appealed to Addams sense of the grotesque, including Victorian woodcuts, vintage medicine-show advertisements, and a boyhood photograph of Francesco Lentini, who had three legs.{{citation needed date=February 2013}}

Addams drew more than 1,300 cartoons over the course of his life. Those that did not appear in The New Yorker were often in Colliers Weekly Colliers and TV Guide.<ref name=maccloskey>{{cite web url=http://www.westfieldnj.com/addams/ last=MacCloskey first=Ron title=Charles Addams publisher=WestfieldNJ.com accessdate=2008-10-26}}</ref> In 1961, Addams received, from the Mystery Writers of America, a Special Edgar Award for his body of work. His cartoons appeared in books, calendars, and other merchandising. Singer-guitarist Dean Gitters 1957 recording Ghost Ballads, an album of folk songs with supernatural themes, was packaged with cover art by Addams showing a haunted house.<ref name="Jason 2004">{{cite web   author=Jason   title=Scar Stuff: Dean Gitter "Ghost Ballads" (Riverside, RLP 12-636, 1957)   website=Scar Stuff   date=2004-02-28   url=http://scarstuff.blogspot.com/2006/04/dean-gitter-ghost-ballads-riverside.html   accessdate=2017-05-09}}</ref> The films The Old Dark House (1963 film) The Old Dark House (1963) and Murder by Death (1976) feature title sequences illustrated by Addams.<ref>{{IMDb name 0011623}}</ref>

In 1946, Addams met science-fiction writer Ray Bradbury after having drawn an illustration for Mademoiselle (magazine) Mademoiselle magazines publication of Bradburys short story "Homecoming", the first in a series of tales chronicling a family of Illinois vampires named the Elliotts. The pair became friends and planned to collaborate on a book of the Elliott Familys complete history with Bradbury writing and Addams providing the illustrations, but it never materialized. Bradburys stories about the "Elliott Family" were finally anthologized in From the Dust Returned in October 2001, with a connecting narrative and an explanation of his work with Addams, and Addams 1946 Mademoiselle illustration used for the books cover jacket. Although Addams own characters were well-established by the time of their initial encounter, in a 2001 interview, Bradbury stated: "(Addams) went his way and created the Addams Family and I went my own way and created my family in this book." <ref>{{cite web url=http://www.indiebound.org/author-interviews/bradburyray  title=Ray Bradbury Interview Part 1  publisher=IndieBound  date=  accessdate=2012-01-07}}</ref>

Janet Maslin, in a review of an Addams biography for The New York Times, wrote: "Addamss persona sounds cooked up for the benefit of feature writers... was at least partly a character contrived for the public eye," noting that one outré publicity photo showed the humorist wearing a suit of armor at home, "but the shelves behind him hold books about painting and antiques, as well as a novel by John Updike."<ref name=maslin>{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/26/books/26masl.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&ref=arts&pagewanted=print last=Maslin first=Janet title=In Search of the Dark Muse of a Master of the Macabre work=The New York Times publisher= date=October 26, 2006 page=E9 accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref>

Filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock was a friend of Addams, and owned two pieces of original Addams art.<ref name=timesdavis/> Hitchcock references Addams in his 1959 film, North by Northwest. During the auction scene, Cary Grant discovers two of his adversaries with someone whom he also thinks is against him and says: "The three of you together. Now thats a picture only Charles Addams could draw."<ref name=northwestfilm/>

The University of Pennsylvania has a Charles Addams Fine Arts Hall on its campus at 36th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. There is a small sculpture of the Addams Family in front of the building.
