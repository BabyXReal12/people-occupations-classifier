Nina Paley (born May 3, 1968) is an American cartoonist, animator and free culture movement free culture activist.
She was the artist and often the writer of the comic strips Ninas Adventures and Fluff, but most of her recent work has been in animation.
She is perhaps best known for creating the animated feature film Sita Sings the Blues, loosely based on the Ramayana, with parallels to her personal life. In 2018, she released her second animated feature, Seder-Masochism, a retelling of The Book of Exodus as patriarchy emerging from goddess worship.

Paley distributes much of her work, including Nina’s Adventures, Fluff, and all the original work in Sita Sings The Blues, under a copyleft licence.

== Early life ==
Paley was born in Urbana, Illinois,
the daughter of Jean (Passovoy) and Hiram Paley.
Her family was American Jewish Jewish.
Her father was a mathematics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign University of Illinois and was mayor of Urbana for a term in the early 1970s.
She attended local elementary and high schools, graduating from University Laboratory High School (Urbana, Illinois) University High School in 1986.
She illustrated a "History of the North Pole" comic in collaboration with University High School history teacher Chris Butler, and attended the University of Illinois, studying art for two years before dropping out. While in college, her comic "Joyride" ran in The Daily Illini newspaper.
Her first animation was made when she was 13; it was recorded on Super-8 reels. Her first animation as an adult was the short story Follow your Bliss. Her second clay animation, I Heart My Cat, was shot on a Krasnogorsk (camera) Krasnogorsk camera. These two, along with Cancer, were found on VHS with the description "NINA PALEY DEMO REEL 1998". In 2012, Paley decided to publish them under Creative Commons license Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike license.

In 1988, Paley moved to Santa Cruz, California, and began to write and draw the strip Ninas Adventures. In 1991, she illustrated The Santa Cruz Haggadah
and moved to San Francisco. In 1995, she began to draw the more mainstream Fluff, a comic strip about a cat, which enjoyed a modest success in syndication. In 1998, she also began to experiment with animation.
In 1999, she made the worlds first cameraless IMAX film, Pandorama,
a short Modernist film which was shown widely at major film festivals in 35 mm form during 2000 and 2001. In 70 mm form, it also ran for about a year as a short feature at Berlin Cinestar and has been shown at IMAX theaters elsewhere.

In 2002, she wrote and directed Fetch!, a humorous short cartoon feature based on a variety of optical illusions, which has enjoyed popularity ever since.
Beginning in 2002, Paley focused her work on the controversial subject of population growth. The most notable entry she produced on this subject was The Stork, in which the natural environment is bombed to destruction by storks dropping bundled babies. The film is a compact expression of the conflict between increasing human population and the ecosystem in which it must live. The 3½ minute film was a considerable success at festivals and resulted in an invitation to the Sundance Film Festival.
During this period of this time, Paley also contributed several comic strips for the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, of which she is a member and occasional spokesperson.
Her work for the group still remains on their official website.
Early in 2010, Paley started drawing a three-panel comic strip called Mimi &amp; Eunice. She is distributing it on the web using a copyleft license.
In 2012, Paley posted an animation to Vimeo titled This Land Is Mine depicting the Middle East conflicts over history; it was named a Staff Pick.
Between projects, Paley has worked as a freelance director at Duck Studios in Los Angeles.
She has also taught in the Design and Technology section of Parsons The New School for Design Parsons, part of The New School.
== Feature films ==
As of 2018, Paley has created two animated feature films.

===Sita Sings the Blues===

In 2002, Paley moved to Trivandrum, India, where her husband had taken a job. While she was visiting New York City on business concerning her third comic strip, The Hots, her husband terminated their marriage. Unable to return to either Trivandrum or San Francisco, she moved to Brooklyn, New York.  Her personal crisis caused her to see more deeply into the Ramayana, the Indian epic, which she had encountered in India, and motivated her to produce a short animation which combines an episode from the Ramayana with a torch song recorded in 1929 by Annette Hanshaw, "Mean To Me".
Paley later added episodes and other material to the work, which is now called Sita Sings the Blues. Many of the episodes appeared in animation festivals. She expanded it into a feature-length treatment of the Ramayana focused on Ramas wife, Sita, using a variety of animation styles and techniques. 

The finished work premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 11, 2008
and had its North American premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 25, 2008.
The film was screened at more than 150 film festivals globally
and was broadcast on PBS in New York City.
For her work on Sita Sings the Blues, Paley was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award
and garnered more than 35 international awards,
including the top award at Annecy International Animated Film Festival Annecy in 2008.
The New York Times review of Sita described it as "ambitious and visually loaded" and the film was named a NYT Critics Pick.
===Seder-Masochism===
In 2011 she began work on a project called Seder-Masochism,
an unorthodox animated film about The Exodus, showing the rise of patriarchy and the fall of goddess worship. Early support was obtained for the project through a crowd-funding campaign on Kickstarter.
In June 2018, after having worked sporadically on the film for six years, Seder-Masochism premiered at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in France.
Reviewers compared Paleys style to Monty Python, and praised the films irreverent humor.
In Poland, the film was screened at the ANIMATOR (festival) ANIMATOR film festival where it was chosen by the audience as the festivals best feature-length animated film.

Because of obstacles in copyright clearing the rights to Hanshaws recordings for the Sita Sings the Blues, Paley took active part in the free culture movement.
Since 2009 she is an artist-in-residence at the non-profit organization QuestionCopyright.org,
which includes running the projects "Minute Memes" and the "Sita Distribution Project".
"Minute Memes"
is a series of short ("one-minute") video "Internet meme memes" made by Paley about copyright restrictions and artistic freedom. She wrote and performed the song "Copying Isnt Theft" meant to be freely remixed by other people,
with the animated clip issued as Minute Meme #1.
Subsequent animations in this series are "All Creative Work Is Derivative",
Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF Tribute
and "Credit is Due: The Attribution Song".
She also wrote "Understanding Free Content", an illustrated guide to the idea of free content.
In 2010 she started a new comic strip Mimi &amp; Eunice, highlighting intellectual property problems and paradoxes.
She has published much of her work, including Nina’s Adventures, Fluff, and all original work in Sita Sings The Blues, under a copyleft licence.
The website for Sita Sings the Blues includes a wiki where its fans contributed translated subtitles for the DVD of the film.
On January 18, 2013, Paley posted on her blog that the copyright license for Sita Sings The Blues was being switched from CC-BY-SA to CC-0, thus placing the work into the public domain.
In 2012 she was a special guest at the international CopyCamp conference in Warsaw.
Paley won a Public Knowledge IP3 award in 2010 "for her work in intellectual property".
== Personal life ==

In 2015, when Paley posted her views about trans-women such as Caitlyn Jenner, some of her friends called her "Transphobia transphobic". This prompted Paley to read about Feminist views on transgender topics trans-exclusionary radical feminism (TERF), and to realize that she was not transphobic but a "gender-critical radical feminist" who argues against the social constructs that lead to a pattern of male violence.
Though of Jewish ancestry, Paley is an atheist
as was her father.
She has been especially critical of Judaism and considers it a form of indoctrination and exploitation.
Paley is openly childfree,
a position she actively promotes and encourages others to adopt.
In 2011, she began making art quilts, some of which she has featured on her official blog.
The first public exhibition of her quilts was held in June 2013 in central Illinois.
