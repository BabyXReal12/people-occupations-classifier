Beginning in 2002, Paley focused her work on the controversial subject of population growth. The most notable entry she produced on this subject was The Stork, in which the natural environment is bombed to destruction by storks dropping bundled babies. The film is a compact expression of the conflict between increasing human population and the ecosystem in which it must live. The 3½ minute film was a considerable success at festivals and resulted in an invitation to the Sundance Film Festival.<ref name="speculist"/>

During this period of this time, Paley also contributed several comic strips for the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, of which she is a member and occasional spokesperson.<ref>{{cite web  url=https://bloggingheads.tv/videos/2707  title= Nina Paley and Mike Treder author=<!--Not stated-->  date=September 11, 2010  website=bloggingheads.tv  publisher= The Nonzero Foundation access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref> Her work for the group still remains on their official website.<ref> {{cite web  url=http://vhemt.org/paleyart.htm  title= VHEMT-related cartoons

== Feature films ==
As of 2018, Paley has created two animated feature films.

===Sita Sings the Blues===
Image:NinaAtBerlinale.jpg thumb right At the Berlinale premiere of Sita Sings the Blues in 2008
In 2002, Paley moved to Trivandrum, India, where her husband had taken a job. While she was visiting New York City on business concerning her third comic strip, The Hots, her husband terminated their marriage. Unable to return to either Trivandrum or San Francisco, she moved to Brooklyn, New York.  Her personal crisis caused her to see more deeply into the Ramayana, the Indian epic, which she had encountered in India, and motivated her to produce a short animation which combines an episode from the Ramayana with a torch song recorded in 1929 by Annette Hanshaw, "Mean To Me".<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.flashgoddess.com/html/gallery_NinaPaley.html  title=Featured artist - Nina Paley: Sita Sings the Blues  author=<!--Not stated-->  date=October 2005  website=www.flashgoddess.com access-date=August 14, 2018}}</ref> Paley later added episodes and other material to the work, which is now called Sita Sings the Blues. Many of the episodes appeared in animation festivals. She expanded it into a feature-length treatment of the Ramayana focused on Ramas wife, Sita, using a variety of animation styles and techniques. 

The finished work premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 11, 2008<ref name="IMDb">{{cite web  url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1172203/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ql_dt_2  title=Sita Sings the Blues (2008) Release Info  author=<!--Not stated-->  date=October 2, 2010  website=www.imdb.com access-date=August 14, 2018}}</ref><ref name=”Ebertfest”>{{cite web  url=http://archive.ebertfest.media.illinois.edu/eleven/sita_sings_the_blues.html  title= Sita Sings the Blues last=Ebert  first=Roger  date=2009  website=Ebertfest.media.illinois.edu  publisher=Roger Eberts Film Festival  access-date=August 14, 2018}}</ref> and had its North American premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 25, 2008.<ref name="Tribeca"> {{cite web  url=https://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/archive/512ce78a1c7d76e046000db0-sita-sings-the-blues  title=Discovery: Sita Sings the Blues  author=<!--Not stated-->  date=April 2008  website=www.tribecafilm.com  publisher=Tribeca Film Festival  access-date=August 14, 2018}}</ref> The film was screened at more than 150 film festivals globally<ref name="Merli4"/> and was broadcast on PBS in New York City.<ref name="Merli5"/> For her work on Sita Sings the Blues, Paley was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award<ref>{{cite web date=December 2, 2008 last1=Moody first1=Annemarie title=Sita Sings Blues Creator Nominated For Indie Spirit Award url=https://www.awn.com/news/sita-sings-blues-creator-nominated-indie-spirit-award website=Animation World Network accessdate=May 8, 2018}}</ref> and garnered more than 35 international awards,<ref name="Merli4"/> including the top award at Annecy International Animated Film Festival Annecy in 2008.<ref name="wapost">{{cite news  last= Ramanathan first= Lavanya  date=September 25, 2008  title= An Ancient Tale, Newly Animated  url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/24/AR2008092404245.html  work=The Washington Post access-date=August 11, 2018}}</ref>  The New York Times review of Sita described it as "ambitious and visually loaded" and the film was named a NYT Critics Pick.<ref>{{cite news  last=Scott  first=A.O.  date=December 24, 2009  title=Legendary Breakups: Good (Animated) Women Done Wrong in India  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/movies/25sita.html  work=The New York Times  access-date=August 7, 2018}}</ref>
