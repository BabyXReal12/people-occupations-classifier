Larson said his family has "a morbid sense of humor",<ref name=wild /> and that he was influenced by the "paranoid" sense of humor of his older brother, Dan.<ref name=walk>[http://mentalfloss.com/article/17358/50-reasons-subscribe-mentalfloss-45-gary-larson Ferguson, Kelly.

==Career==

===Early cartoon work===
According to Larson in his anthology The Prehistory of The Far Side,<ref name=prehistory>Larson, Gary. The Prehistory of the Far Side: a 10th anniversary exhibit. Kansas City, MO: Andrew and McNeel, 1989. {{ISBN 0-8362-1851-5}}</ref> he was working in a music store<ref name=Salon99 /> when he took a few days off, after finally realizing how much he hated his job. During that time, he decided to try cartooning. In 1976, he drew six cartoons and submitted them to Pacific Search (afterwards Pacific Northwest Magazine), a Seattle-based magazine.<ref name=Salon99 /> After contributing to another local Seattle paper, in 1979 Larson submitted his work to The Seattle Times. Under the title Natures Way, his work was published weekly next to the Junior Jumble.<ref name=prehistory />

To supplement his income, Larson worked for the Humane Society as a cruelty investigator.<ref name=wild />

===The Far Side===
{{Main article The Far Side}}
Larson decided that he could increase his income from cartooning by selling his Natures Way strip to another newspaper. While on vacation in San Francisco, he pitched his work to the San Francisco Chronicle and, to his surprise, the Chronicle bought the strip and promoted it for Print syndication syndication, renaming it The Far Side.<ref name=Salon99 /> Its first appearance in the Chronicle was on January 1, 1980.  A week later, The Seattle Times dropped Nature’s Way.<ref name=prehistory /> The Far Side ran for fifteen years, syndicated initially by Chronicle Features and later by Universal Press Syndicate, until Larson retired with his final strip published on January 1, 1995.

Themes in The Far Side were often Surreal humour surreal, such as "How cows behave when no human watches" or "The unexpected dangers of being an insect." Often, the behavior of supposedly superior humans was compared with animals. For instance, a father explains to his son that a bird song is a territorial marking common to the lower animals, while surrounded by fences and dense housing. Animals and other creatures were frequently presented anthropomorphism anthropomorphically. One strip depicts a family of spiders driving in a car with a "Have a Nice Day" bumper sticker, featuring a "smiley face" with eight eyes.

One of Larsons more famous cartoons shows a chimpanzee couple grooming. The female finds a blonde human hair on the male and inquires, "Conducting a little more research with that Jane Goodall tramp?" A representative from the Jane Goodall Institute thought that this was in bad taste and wrote a critical letter to Larson regarding the cartoon.  Larson contacted the Goodall Institute to apologize only to find that Jane Goodall herself, who was in Africa at the time of the cartoons publication and only learned of it years after its initial publication, approved of it, stating that she found it amusing. Since then, all profits from sales of a shirt featuring this cartoon go to the Goodall Institute.<ref>{{cite book   url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5eIBwAAQBAJ   title=Make em Laugh!

In 1988, Larson visited Gombe Stream National Park and was attacked by Kasakela_Chimpanzee_Community#Frodo Frodo, a chimp described by Goodall as a "bully". Larson sustained cuts and bruises from the encounter.<ref>{{Citation  last=Hartley  first=Aiden  title=Me rodo, you Jane  journal=The Spectator  date=2002-06-29 url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200206/ai_n9130751/  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113105048/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200206/ai_n9130751/  dead-url=yes  archive-date=2010-01-13 }}</ref>

=== Retirement ===
By late-1994, Larson thought the series was getting repetitive and did not want to enter what he called the "Graveyard of Mediocre Cartoons."<ref name=walk/><ref name=Salon99 /> He retired the strip on January 1, 1995, when he was 44 years old. Since retiring from The Far Side, Larson has done occasional cartoon work, including magazine illustrations and promotional artwork for Far Side merchandise. For the most part, he has also retired from public view: "He refuses to have his picture taken and avoids being on TV," Time (magazine) Time magazine wrote in 2003. To Larson, "cartoonists are expected to be anonymous."<ref>Stein, Joel.

On March 15, 1989, a newly discovered insect species was named after Larson by Dale H. Clayton, head of the Committee of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago. The Strigiphilus garylarsoni is a chewing louse<ref name=wild /> of a genus found only on owls. Wrote Larson: "I considered this an extreme honor. Besides, I knew no one was going to write and ask to name a new species of swan after me. You have to grab these opportunities when they come along." An Letter (paper size) 8" × 11" (20 × 28 cm) magnification of the insect appeared in the Prehistory of the Far Side 10th anniversary compilation, along with the letter requesting permission to use his name. Similarly, an Ecuadorian rainforest butterfly was named after him; Serratoterga larsoni.<ref name=walk/> The Garylarsonus beetle carries his name.<ref>[http://www.curioustaxonomy.net/etym/people.html Curiosities of Biological Nomenclature: Etymologies<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{Better source reason=I only see this genus (?) mentioned in list of taxa named after Larson; there should be a source confirming this taxon exists and was formally named, ideally in the Coleoptera literature. date=September 2017}} The term "thagomizer", a feature of stegosaurus anatomy, was coined in a Far Side cartoon.<ref name=Salon99 />
