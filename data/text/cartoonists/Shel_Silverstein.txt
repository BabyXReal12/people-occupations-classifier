==Early life==
Born into a Jewish family,<ref>{{cite news  url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/short-takes/dancing-shel-silverstein  title=Dancing to Shel Silverstein  newspaper=The New York Jewish Week  date=28 April 2014  accessdate=15 December 2015  author=Ted Merwin}}</ref> Silverstein grew up in the Logan Square, Chicago Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago, attended Theodore Roosevelt High School (Chicago) Roosevelt High School and, later, the  University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign University of Illinois, from which he was expelled. He then enrolled in Chicago Academy of Fine Arts where he was attending when he was drafted into the United States Army. He served in Japan and Korea.

File:Shelaroundworld07.jpg left thumb Shel Silversteins Playboy travelogues were collected in 2007.

Silverstein began drawing at age seven by tracing the works of  Al Capp.<ref>Studs Terkel interview, WFMT, December 12, 1963.</ref> He told Publishers Weekly: "When I was a kid—12 to 14, Id much rather have been a good baseball player or a hit with the girls, but I couldnt play ball. I couldnt dance. Luckily, the girls didnt want me. Not much I could do about that. So I started to draw and to write. I was also lucky that I didnt have anybody to copy, be impressed by. I had developed my own style; I was creating before I knew there was a James Thurber Thurber, a Robert Benchley Benchley, a George Price (New Yorker cartoonist) Price and a Saul Steinberg Steinberg. I never saw their work til I was around 30. By the time I got to where I was attracting girls, I was already into work, and it was more important to me. Not that I wouldnt rather make love, but the work has become a habit."<ref name=pw>Mercier, Jean F. "Shel Silverstein", Publishers Weekly, February 24, 1975.</ref>

He was first published in the Roosevelt Torch, a student newspaper at Roosevelt University, where he studied English after leaving the Art Institute. During his time in the military, his cartoons were published in Pacific Stars and Stripes, where he had originally been assigned to do layouts and paste-up. His first book, Take Ten, a compilation of his military Take Ten cartoon series, was published by Pacific Stars and Stripes in 1955. He later said his time in college was a waste and would have been better spent traveling around the world meeting people.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.super-childrens-books.com/shel-silverstein-biography.html title=Shel Silverstein Biography publisher=Super Childrens Books accessdate=June 10, 2012}}</ref>

After returning to Chicago, Silverstein began submitting cartoons to magazines while also selling hot dogs at Chicago ballparks. His cartoons began appearing in Look (American magazine) Look, Sports Illustrated and This Week (magazine) This Week.<ref name=legacy>{{cite web  url=http://www.legacyrecordings.com/Shel-Silverstein.aspx  title=Shel Silversteins Music (Legacy Recordings)  archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68AeLsyim?url=http://www.legacyrecordings.com/Shel-Silverstein.aspx  archivedate=June 4, 2012  deadurl=yes  df=mdy }}</ref>

Mass-market paperback readers across America were introduced to Silverstein in 1956 when Take Ten was reprinted by Ballantine Books as Grab Your Socks! The edition included a foreword by Bill Mauldin.{{citation needed date=October 2014}}

In 1957, Silverstein became one of the leading cartoonists in Playboy, which sent him around the world to create an illustrated travel journal with reports from far-flung locales. During the 1950s and 1960s, he produced 23 installments called "Shel Silverstein Visits..." as a feature for Playboy. Employing a sketchbook format with typewriter-styled captions, he documented his own experiences at such locations as a New Jersey nudist colony, the Chicago White Sox training camp, San Franciscos Haight-Ashbury district, Fire Island, Mexico, London, Paris, Spain and Africa. In a Swiss village, he drew himself complaining, "Ill give them 15 more minutes, and if nobody yodels, Im going back to the hotel." These illustrated travel essays were collected by the publisher Fireside in Playboys Silverstein Around the World, published in 2007 with a foreword by Hugh Hefner and an introduction by music journalist Mitch Myers.<ref name=tim>{{cite web url=http://shelsilverstein.tripod.com/DrHook/dh110972.html  title=Cahill, Tim.

=="Now heres my plan..."==
File:Nowplansilverstein.jpg thumb "Now heres my plan...", Shel Silversteins best known cartoon of the 1950s, became the title of his 1960 cartoon collection.
  
His best-known cartoon of the 1950s was featured on the cover of his next cartoon collection, Now Heres My Plan: A Book of Futilities, which was published by Simon & Schuster in 1960. Silverstein biographer Lisa Rogak wrote:
:The cartoon on the cover that provides the books title would turn out to be one of his most famous and often-cited cartoons. In the cartoon, two prisoners are chained to the wall of a prison cell. Both their hands and feet are shackled. One says to the other, "Now heres my plan." Silverstein was both fascinated and distressed by the amount of analysis and commentary that almost immediately began to swirl around the cartoon. "A lot of people said it was a very pessimistic cartoon, which I dont think it is at all," he said. "Theres a lot of hope even in a hopeless situation. They analyze it and question it. I did this cartoon because I had an idea about a funny situation about two guys."<ref name=rogak/>

Silversteins cartoons appeared in issues of Playboy from 1957 through the mid-1970s, and one of his Playboy features was expanded into Uncle Shelbys ABZ Book (Simon & Schuster, 1961), his first book of new, original material for adults. Because it was unclear whether some of the material was intended for adults or children, the 1985 reprint had a conspicuous cover label.{{citation needed date=October 2014}}

==Views on his own writing ==
Silversteins editor at Harper & Row, Ursula Nordstrom, encouraged Silverstein to write childrens poetry. Silverstein said that he had never studied the poetry of others and had therefore developed his own quirky style, laid back and conversational, occasionally employing profanity and slang. In a 1975 Publishers Weekly interview, he was asked how he came to do childrens books:

<blockquote>He is a strong, well-muscled, fit-looking man who wears blue jeans and a big cowboy hat. Though he has to be into his 40s (hes a Korean War veteran), he is also totally in touch with the contemporary scene... How, then, PW wanted to know, had he decided to get into childrens books? "I didnt," Shel said, "I never planned to write or draw for kids. It was Tomi Ungerer, a friend of mine, who insisted—practically dragged me, kicking and screaming, into Ursula Nordstroms office. And she convinced me that Tomi was right; I could do childrens books." The relationship between Ursula Nordstrom and Shel Silverstein is mutually rewarding. He considers her a superb editor who knows when to leave an author-illustrator alone. Asked if he would change something he had produced on an editors say-so, he answered with a flat "No." But he added: "Oh, I will take a suggestion for revision. I do eliminate certain things when Im writing for children if I think only an adult will get the idea. Then I drop it, or save it. But editors messing with content? No." Had he been surprised by the astronomical record of The Giving Tree, his biggest seller to date and one of the most successful childrens books in years? Another emphatic no. "What I do is good," he said. "I wouldnt let it out if I didnt think it was." But The Giving Tree, which has been selling steadily since it appeared almost 10 years ago and has been translated into French, is not his own favorite among his books. "I like Uncle Shelbys ABZ, A Giraffe and a Half, and Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back—I think I like that one the most." The Giving Tree is one of those rare creations that seem to defy categorization, appealing equally to the reverent and the irreverent, the sophisticated and the simple.
It tells of a tree and the use a man makes of it. When he is a boy, he plays in the trees branches and enjoys its luscious fruit. Later, he courts his love under the tree and uses some of its wood to build a house for his family. Years pass; the man is now old and alone. The tree lets him take its trunk to carve a boat from, and the man rows away. Finally he returns for the last time to sit and rest on the stump of the tree—all thats left of it.<ref name=pw/><ref>{{cite web url=http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n79-45309  title=WorldCat  publisher=WorldCat  date=  accessdate=2013-02-27}}</ref></blockquote>

Otto Penzler, in his crime anthology Murder for Revenge (1998), commented on Silversteins versatility:

{{quote The phrase "Renaissance man" tends to get overused these days, but apply it to Shel Silverstein and it practically begins to seem inadequate. Not only has he produced with seeming ease country music hits and popular songs, but hes been equally successful at turning his hand to poetry, short stories, plays, and childrens books. Moreover, his whimsically hip fables, beloved by readers of all ages, have made him a stalwart of bestseller lists. A Light in the Attic, most remarkably, showed the kind of staying power on the New York Times chart—two years, to be precise—that most of the biggest names (John Grisham, Stephen King and Michael Crichton) have never equaled with their blockbusters. His unmistakable illustrative style is another crucial element to his appeal. Just as no writer sounds like Shel, no other artists vision is as delightfully, sophisticatingly cockeyed. One can only marvel that he makes the time to respond so kindly to his friends requests. In the following work, lets be glad he did. Drawing on his characteristic passion for list making, he shows how the deed is not just in the wish but in the sublimation.{{citation needed date=October 2014}}}}

This anthology was the second in a series, which also included Murder for Love (1996) and Murder and Obsession (1999). All three anthologies included Silverstein contributions. He did not really care to conform to any sort of norm, but he did want to leave his mark for others to be inspired by, as he told Publishers Weekly:

<blockquote>I would hope that people, no matter what age, would find something to identify with in my books, pick up one and experience a personal sense of discovery. Thats great. I think that if youre a creative person, you should just go about your business, do your work and not care about how its received. I never read reviews because if you believe the good ones you have to believe the bad ones too. Not that I dont care about success. I do, but only because it lets me do what I want. I was always prepared for success but that means that I have to be prepared for failure too. I have an ego, I have ideas, I want to be articulate, to communicate but in my own way. People who say they create only for themselves and dont care if they are published... I hate to hear talk like that. If its good, its too good not to share. Thats the way I feel about my work. So Ill keep on communicating, but only my way. Lots of things I wont do. I wont go on television because who am I talking to? Johnny Carson? The camera? Twenty million people I cant see? Uh-uh. And I wont give any more interviews.<ref name="pw"/><ref>{{cite web url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2013/10/my_shel_silverstein_biography_can_t_quote_shel_silverstein_why.html  title=My Shel Silverstein biography cant quote Shel Silverstein.

Silverstein also wrote one of Johnny Cashs best known hits, "A Boy Named Sue" as well as "The Unicorn (song) The Unicorn", first recorded by Silverstein himself in 1962 but better known in its version by The Irish Rovers. Other songs co-written by Silverstein include "the Taker" written with Kris Kristofferson and recorded by Waylon Jennings, and a sequel to "A Boy Named Sue" called "Father of a Boy Named Sue", which is less known, but he performed the song on television on The Johnny Cash Show (TV series) The Johnny Cash Show.

Silverstein composed original music for several films and displayed a musical versatility in these projects, playing guitar, piano, saxophone and trombone. He wrote "In the Hills of Shiloh", a poignant song about the aftermath of the American Civil War Civil War, which was recorded by The New Christy Minstrels, Judy Collins, Bobby Bare and others. The soundtrack of the 1970 film Ned Kelly (1970 film) Ned Kelly features Silverstein songs performed by Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson and others.<ref name="legacy"/>

Among his best-known comedy songs were "Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout (Would Not Take The Garbage Out)", "The Smoke-Off" (a tale of a contest to determine who could roll—or smoke—marijuana joints faster), "I Got Stoned and I Missed It" and "Stacy Brown Got Two." He wrote "The Father of a Boy Named Sue", in which he tells the story from the original song from the fathers point of view, and the 1962 song "Boa Constrictor", sung by a person who is being swallowed by a snake (recorded by the folk group Peter, Paul, and Mary) also recorded by Johnny Cash for his 1966 album Everybody Loves A Nut although it is now better known as a childrens playground chant.{{citation needed date=October 2014}}

==Theater==
{{unreferenced section date=October 2014}}

In January 1959, Look, Charlie: A Short History of the Pratfall was a chaotic off-Broadway comedy staged by Silverstein, Jean Shepherd and Herb Gardner at New Yorks Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan) Orpheum Theatre on Second Avenue in the Lower East Side. Silverstein went on to write more than 100 one-act plays. The Devil and Billy Markham, published in Playboy in 1979, was later adapted into a solo one-act play that debuted on a double bill with David Mamet Mamets Bobby Gould in Hell (1989) with Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show Dr. Hook vocalist Dennis Locorriere narrating. Karen Kohlhaas directed An Adult Evening of Shel Silverstein, produced by New Yorks Atlantic Theater Company in September 2001 with a variety of short sketches:
*"One Tennis Shoe"—Harvey claims his wife is becoming a homelessness bag lady.
*"Bus Stop"—Irwin stands on a corner with a "bus stop" sign.
*"Going Once"—A woman auctions herself.
*"The Best Daddy"—Lisas daddy shot the pony he got for her birthday.
*"The Lifeboat is Sinking"—Jen and Sherwin play a game of Who-Would-You-Save-If—the family was drowning.
*"Smile"—Bender plans to punish the man responsible for the phrase "Have a nice day".
*"Watch and Dry"—Marianne discovers her laundry has not been cleaned.

*"Buy One, Get One Free"—Hookers offer a golden opportunity.
*"Blind Willie and the Talking Dog"—Blind Willies talking dog argues they could profit from his talent.

A production of An Adult Evening of Shel Silverstein was produced by a Hofstra University theater group called The Spectrum Players, which was founded by Francis Ford Coppola in 1959. The production used a "victorian sailors on shore leave watching a play" aesthetic and used live rag-time and an MC character not in the script to transition between pieces. The production was directed by Richard Traub of Chicago and starred several of Hofstras most promising young actors: Nick Pacifico, Amanda Mac, Mike Quattrone, Ross Greenberg, Chelsea Lando, Allie Rightmeyer, and Paolo Perez as the MC.

In December 2001, Shels Shorts was produced in repertory as two separate evenings under the titles Signs of Trouble and Shel Shocked by the Market Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Signs of Trouble was directed by Wesley Savick, and Shel Shocked was directed by Larry Coen.

Silverstein believed that written works needed to be read on paper—the correct paper for the particular work. He usually would not allow his poems and stories to be published unless he could choose the type, size, shape, color, and quality of the paper. Being a book collector, he took seriously the feel of the paper, the look of the book, the fonts, and the binding. Most of his books did not have paperback editions because he did not want his work to be diminished in any way. Silversteins estate continues to control copyright permissions on his work and has blocked the quotations of that work in at least one biographical treatment.<ref name="Thomas 2013"/>
