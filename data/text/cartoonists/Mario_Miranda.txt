==Mural in Café Mondegar==
{{Main Café Mondegar#Murals}}
In 1990s, Rushi Yazdegardi (then owner) asked Mario Miranda to draw murals (cartoons) on two opposite walls of Café Mondegar. Both walls have different themes. Whilst one wall is dedicated to the Life in Mumbai, the other wall is dedicated to Atmosphere in the Café.<ref name="Cartoonist who loved to draw">{{cite news title=Cartoonist who loved to draw publisher=Hindustan Times accessdate=Jul 2015 url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai/mario-miranda-cartoonist-who-loved-to-draw/article1-781069.aspx}}</ref>

==Beyond cartooning==
Besides cartooning, Mirandas murals are present on various buildings in Goa and other parts of India. Late in life he took to paintings which received wide response.

Over the years, he published several books, including Laugh it Off, Goa with Love, and Germany in Wintertime.

Besides his own books, he illustrated books by Dom Moraes (A Journey to Goa), Manohar Malgaonkar (Inside Goa) and Mario Cabral e Sás (Legends of Goa). He also illustrated many childrens books, including Dul-Dul, The Magic Clay Horse (1968), The Adventures of Pilla the Pup (1969), and Lumbdoom, The Long-Tailed Langoor (1968), all written by Uma Anand and published by India Book House, Mumbai, under its Echo imprint.

He loved to travel and listening to music and it was his ambition to experiment further with water colours and to write memories of his early years in Goa, on retirement. He was not able to fulfil these two latter ambitions.

==Later years and death==
After retirement, Miranda lived in his ancestral home, at Loutolim, a village in Salcete, Goa, with his wife, younger son and their pets. This house features in the 1985 Shyam Benegal film, Trikaal. Even after he retired, Mirandas work was seen regularly in Mumbai publications, and he was invited to travel to countries such as Mauritius and Spain, and draw their local cultures.<ref>[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ET_Features/Special_Pages/Culture_Cauldron/Travels_on_canvas_and_colour/articleshow/2493952.cms Travels on canvas and colour, The Economictimes, 27 Oct 2007]</ref> On 11 December 2011, Mario Miranda died of natural causes at his home in Loutolim.<ref>{{cite web url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/cartoonist-mario-miranda-dies-at-85/210847-3.html title=Cartoonist Mario Miranda dies at 85 publisher=CNN-IBN date=11 December 2011  accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref> His funeral was held on 12/12/11 at Loutulim Saviour of the World Church, where the family choir of Miguel Cotta, rendered for the first time Andrew Lloyd Webbers version of Pie Jesu. Marios body was then taken to the Hindu Crematorium in Pagifond, Margao, where he was cremated, thus fulfilling his wish, according to his wife.

Indian cartoonist Graphi and fine artist, Vins (cartoonist) Vijay N Seth (Vins) paid tribute to Miranda, whom he considered as a mentor:

<blockquote>With pen & ink that were at his command to churn out lines that every nib would be jealous of, he brushed aside the old school of cartooning using the brush, and set a new norm to use the nib pen and to master it for this branch of art. Mario created characters that gave his daily audience their quota of a smile without malice. His trips around the globe produced subtle close observations of the local musings – a fitting example of how far can one stretch the parameters of this branch of neglected art.<ref name=vijay>{{cite web last=Seth (vinns) first=Vijay N title=Cartoon-artist Mario: a tribute date=16 December 2011 url=http://www.indiaartndesign.com/2011/12/cartoon-artist-mario-tribute.html publisher=India Art and Design accessdate=16 April 2012 deadurl=yes archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707082316/http://www.indiaartndesign.com/2011/12/cartoon-artist-mario-tribute.html archivedate=7 July 2012 df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>
