==Early life==
Born in Encino, Los Angeles, California Encino, California,<ref>[http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2005-A-Fi/Breathed-Berkeley.html Encyclopedia of World Biography]</ref> and raised in Houston, Texas, Breathed attended Westchester Academy for International Studies Westchester High School<ref name=houston>[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2007_4318027 Berkowitz, Lana, "His latest opus: Bloom County creator finds a more constructive path writing childrens books] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522103926/http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2007_4318027  date=2011-05-22 }}", Houston Chronicle, April 4, 2007</ref> in Houston.

==Cartooning career==
Breathed was first published when he was hired part-time by the Austin American-Statesman to draw editorial cartoons for the newspaper. This job was short-lived; he was dismissed shortly after one of his cartoons caused outrage.<ref>{{cite book  last=Breathed  first=Berke  title=Classics of Western Literature: Bloom County, 1986-1989  page=2  year=1990  publisher=Little, Brown  isbn=0-316-10754-9}}</ref> His first comic strip published regularly was The Academia Waltz, which appeared in the Daily Texan, in 1978 while he was a student at the University of Texas. During his time at the University of Texas, Breathed self-published two collections of The Academia Waltz, using the profits to pay his tuition. The comic strip attracted the notice of the editors of The Washington Post, who recruited him to do a nationally syndicated strip. On December 8, 1980, Bloom County made its debut and featured some of the characters from Academia Waltz, including former frat-boy Steve Dallas and the paraplegic Vietnam war veteran Cutter John. In the beginning, the strips style was so similar to that of another popular strip, Doonesbury, that Doonesburys creator Garry Trudeau wrote to Breathed several times to indicate their similarities.<ref name="latimesblog">[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2009/10/berkeley-breathed-drawn-back-to-bloom-county-but-looking-forward.html Ellen, Mary, "Berkeley Breathed, drawn back to Bloom County but looking forward"], Los Angeles Times "Hero Complex" blog. Retrieved 2010-06-27.</ref> Breathed has acknowledged that he borrowed liberally from Doonesbury during his early career. In the Outland collection, One Last Little Peek, Breathed even put an early Bloom County side-by-side with the Doonesbury comic strip from which it obviously took its idea.

Bloom County earned Breathed the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning during 1987.<ref name="pulitzer">[http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1987 Pulitzer Prize Awards List 1987]</ref> The strip eventually appeared in over 1,200 newspapers around the world until Breathed retired the daily strip in 1989, stating that he wanted to terminate the strip while it was still popular. At that time, he said, "A good comic strip is no more eternal than a ripe melon. The ugly truth is that in most cases, comics age less gracefully than their creators".<ref name="website">[http://www.berkeleybreathed.com/pages/About.asp The Official Berkeley Breathed Website] {{webarchive  url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513175844/http://www.berkeleybreathed.com/pages/About.asp  date=May 13, 2008 }}</ref>

He replaced this strip with the surreal Sunday-only cartoon Outland (comics) Outland in 1989, which reused some of the Bloom County characters, including Opus the Penguin and Bill the Cat. He ended Outland in 1995.

In 2003, Breathed began the comic strip Opus (comic strip) Opus, a Sunday-only strip featuring Opus the Penguin, who was one of the main characters of Bloom County.

Several newspapers chose not to run the August 26, 2007, Opus cartoon because it might offend Muslims.<ref name="foxnews">[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,294779,00.html Donaldson-Evans, Catherine, "Washington Post, Other Newspapers Wont Run Opus Cartoon Mocking Radical Islam"], Fox News, August 28, 2007</ref>

On October 6, 2008, Breathed announced plans to discontinue all work on comic strips with the final Opus strip to run on November 2, 2008.<ref name="latimes">[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2008/10/berkeley-breath.html Stern, Sherry, "Berkeley Breathed says goodbye to Opus: Im destroying the village to save it"], Los Angeles Times, October 6, 2008</ref> Breathed planned to focus on writing childrens literature childrens books.<ref name=houston /> Breathed explained that he felt that the United States was going to face "tough times", and that he wanted to end the saga of his most memorable character "on a lighter note".

The last Opus comic strip appeared on schedule, but in what may be a comic first the final panel required an online link. The final panel of the strip showed Opus sleeping peacefully in the bed depicted in the classic childrens book, Goodnight Moon. This panel was available only online, and the Humane Society of the United States page that displayed it no longer exists.

Breathed said that he had no regrets in leaving political cartooning, as he believed the atmosphere became too bitter for him to make quality cartoons.<ref name="CNN">"[http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/10/13/berkeley.breathed/index.html Vick dog inspired Bloom County, Opus creator]." CNN. October 13, 2009. Retrieved on October 13, 2009.</ref>

In July 2015 Breathed hinted at a return to the strip when he posted a photo to Facebook of him at his computer, starting a cartoon entitled "Bloom County 2015".  He added: "A return after 25 years. Feels like going home."<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/berkeleybreathed/photos/a.114529165244512.10815.108793262484769/1003525033011583/]</ref> The strip was later posted to Facebook.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/berkeleybreathed/photos/a.114529165244512.10815.108793262484769/1004028256294594/]</ref> He has subsequently been posting new Bloom County strips via Facebook on an almost-daily basis, as of January 2018.<ref>

==Personal life==
<!--In order to mention anything related to spasmodic torticollis, please provide a reliable source from a newspaper-->
Breathed is a fan of outdoor activities such as powerboating and motorcycle motorcycling. In 1986, he broke his back in an ultralight-plane crash, later incorporated into a Bloom County storyline in which Steve Dallas breaks his back after being attacked by an angry Sean Penn. Breathed also nearly lost his right arm to a boating accident.<ref name="latimesblog" />

Breathed once stated he is an atheist.<ref>[https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200402/berkeley-breathed-pokes-fun Whitney, William, "Berkeley Breathed Pokes Fun"], Psychology Today, January/February 2004</ref>
