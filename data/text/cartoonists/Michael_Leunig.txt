Leunig began his cartoon career while at Swinburne in 1965<ref>Gravett, Paul, 1001 Comics You Should Read Before You Die, Universe, 2011, p. 269.</ref> when his cartoons appeared in the Monash University student newspaper Lots Wife (student newspaper) Lots Wife.<ref>{{cite web title=Leunig, Michael (1945–) – People and organisations url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/498419?q=creator%3A%22Leunig%2C+Michael%2C+1945-%22&c=people work=Trove publisher=National Library of Australia accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref> In the early 1970s his work appeared in the radical/satirical magazines Nation Review, The Digger (alternative magazine) The Digger and Londons Oz (magazine) Oz magazine as well as mainstream publications including Newsday and Womans Day.

The main outlet for Leunigs work has been the daily Fairfax press, Melbournes The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald. In more recent years he has focused mainly on political commentary, sometimes substituting his simple drawings with reproduced photographic images with speech balloons attached. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has also provided airtime to Leunig to discuss his views on a range of political and philosophical issues.

=== Family ===
Leunigs first marriage, to Pamela Munro, ended in divorce. He married his second wife, Helga, in 1992. His four children were all born on notable dates: Gus on Guy Fawkes Day 1974; Sunny on Valentines Day 1977; Minna on Australia Day 1992 and Felix on Christmas Day 1994.<ref>{{cite journal title=Rewind journal=Sunday Life magazine The Sunday Age date=16 December 2007 page=54}}</ref>

His sister, Mary Leunig (b. 1950), is also an accomplished cartoonist.<ref>{{cite web title=About url=http://www.maryleunig.com/ work=maryleunig.com website accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>

== Cartoons ==
Leunigs drawings are done with a sparse and quivering line, usually in black and white with ink ink wash, the human characters always drawn with exaggerated noses. This style served him well in his early years when he gained a loyal following for his quirky take on social issues. He also made increasingly frequent forays into a personal fantasy world of whimsy, featuring small figures with teapots balanced on their heads, grotesquely curled hair and many ducks.

Leunig has frequently satirised concepts such as Americanisation, greed, consumerism, corporations and warmongering, in a personal proclamation against the War on Terror. Of particular note were his parodies of political matters, especially those concerning former Australian Prime Minister John Howard and former American president George W. Bush. This has earned Leunig the description of "political cartoonist",<ref name="wsws">{{cite web title=Zionists witch-hunt Australias leading cartoonist url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2006/02/leun-f23.html work=World Socialist Web Site accessdate=13 December 2013 author=Richard Phillips date=23 February 2006}}</ref> though this is misleading as only some of his works are political in nature or reference.

His work has also frequently explored spiritual and religious themes.

=== Controversial works ===
Image:Michael Leunig.jpg thumb Michael Leunig speaks at a demonstration in Melbourne against 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict Israels military action in Gaza, 2009

In 2008, Leunig wrote that "Artists must never shrink from a confrontation with society or the state."<ref>{{cite web title=Art from the heart url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/michael-leunig/art-from-the-heart/2008/06/05/1212259005269.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 work=The Age accessdate=13 December 2013 author=Michael Leunig date=7 June 2008}}</ref> His cartoons have occasionally been a source of controversy. Between 1995 and 2000 he drew the ire of "working mothers" by satirising the heavy reliance upon childcare services in Australian culture in several of his works.<ref>{{cite web title=All Care... url=http://www.cartoonists.com.au/cartoonists-articles/2000/4/29/all-care/ work=Sydney Morning Herald accessdate=13 December 2013 author=Bettina Arndt date=29 April 2000}}</ref>

Leunigs opposition to the 2003 2003 Invasion of Iraq invasion of Iraq, although in line with over three-quarters of the Australian populace,<ref>{{cite news title=Australian PM censured over Iraq url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2727551.stm work=BBC News website publisher=BBC accessdate=13 December 2013 date=5 February 2003}}</ref> drew some criticism in the press.  He commented that "...if a cartoonist is representing the government line on Iraq, theyre nothing better than a propagandist."<ref name="wsws" />

In 2006, Fairfax Media censored a cartoon in New South Wales but not in Victoria (Australia) Victoria, which criticised the then-Prime Minister, John Howard.<ref>{{cite web title=Leunig and Good Taste url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1650231.htm work=Media Watch (TV program) Media Watch publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation accessdate=13 December 2013 date=29 May 2006}}</ref>

Leunig has also stated his opposition to the Israeli government and three of his 2004 – 2006 pieces drew letters of protest nationally and internationally in relation to this.  The three pieces took as their subjects: Israel Defense Forces IDF bomber pilots (13 April 2004); Sheikh Ahmed Yassins assassination order from Ariel Sharon (11 January 2006); and the renewed Gaza Strip Gaza occupation (12 July 2006). A fourth piece was refused publication and has since been more widely criticised for potentially confounding his opposition to the policies of Israel, with an antisemitic, generalised subversion of the Jewish experience, by relying upon a reference to the Jewish Holocaust.  This piece came to international attention after it won an Iranian competition conceived by the newspaper Hamshahri as retaliation for the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy Muhammad cartoons controversy.  Leunig denied he had submitted the cartoon as an entry to the competition and said "Ive been set up horribly, maliciously".<ref name="BBChoax">{{cite news title=Australian in Iran cartoon hoax url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4711504.stm work=BBC news website accessdate=13 December 2013 date=14 February 2006}}</ref> He demanded the cartoons be withdrawn, which the newspaper did and also apologised to him.<ref name="BBChoax" /> It later emerged that the cartoon had been submitted as a prank by a web contributor to the Australian comedic team The Chaser (newspaper) The Chaser.<ref>{{cite web title=Chaser behind Leunig stunt url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/chaser-behind-leunig-stunt/2006/02/15/1139890807095.html work=Sydney Morning Herald accessdate=13 December 2013 author=Justin Norrie date=16 February 2006}}</ref>

Leunig has partially defined his position with this statement:
{{cquote I have a Jewish friend, a Holocaust survivor, who says that she never could have lived in Israel because in her view it is a totalitarian state.... I believe that something fundamental and vital, not just to Israel but to the entire world, has been gravely mishandled by the present Israeli administration and it bothers me deeply. It is my right to express it.<ref name="wsws" /> 20px 20px Michael Leunig   13 January 2006, The Age}}

==Characters and themes==

In the series of cartoons that Leunig has created over the duration of his career, a number of characters have persisted.

===Collaboration with Gyan===
In 2006 Australian musician Gyan Evans released the album Billy the Rabbit which was based on the poetry of Leunig.  Gyan and Leunig launched the album at the Melbourne Writers Festival with Leunig illustrating during Gyans singing.  They also performed together at the Byron Bay Writers Festival and the Sydney Opera House.

According to Gyan:

{{cquote It came about through a complete labour of love. I set a lot of his poetry to music over the space of a year without really knowing what I was doing. I had no motive, no plan. A friend of mine knew him and I contacted him at The Age and sent it to him, he fell madly in love with it.<ref>{{cite web title=Gyan and Mr Curly url=http://echo.net.au/archives/19_10/pdf/p22.pdf archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831065850/http://echo.net.au/archives/19_10/pdf/p22.pdf archivedate=2006-08-31 work=The Echo – Echonetdaily accessdate=13 December 2013 page=2 format=PDF}}</ref>
