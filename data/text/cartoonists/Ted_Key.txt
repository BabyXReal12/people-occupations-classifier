Keys most famous creation, the single-panel Hazel, about a wry and bossy household maid, came to Key in 1943 in a dream that he drew the next morning and sent to The Saturday Evening Post, where it was accepted and began running regularly.<ref name=nyt /> He soon afterward gave the character a name and employment at the Baxter household. In 2008, the cartoonists son, Peter Key, said, "He picked the name Hazel out of the air, but there was an editor at The Post who had a sister named Hazel. She thought her brother came up with the name, and she didnâ€™t speak to him for two years."<ref name=nyt />

The cartoon ran until the weekly magazine ceased publication in 1969. Hazel was then picked up for newspaper syndication by King Features Syndicate.<ref name=toonopedia-hazel>[http://toonopedia.com/hazel.htm Hazel] at Don Marksteins Toonopedia. [https://www.webcitation.org/66tVx9fSn?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/hazel.htm Archived] from the original on April 13, 2012.</ref> With the increased output of six cartoons a week, Key hired veteran gag cartoonist Stan Fine to lend a hand.

Key later adapted his comic panel into the television show Hazel (TV series) Hazel, starring Shirley Booth as the titular maid.  It ran from 1961 to 1964 on NBC; for its final 1965 season, the show switched to CBS.  Key continued to draw the strip until his retirement in 1993.<ref>{{cite web  last =Evanier  first =Mark  authorlink =  coauthors =  title =Ted Key, R.I.P.  work =  publisher =P.O.V.
