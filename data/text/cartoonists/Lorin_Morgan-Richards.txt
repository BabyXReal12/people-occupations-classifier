Lorin Morgan-Richards (born 16 February 1975) is an American author and illustrator,
primarily of childrens literature. He was also the publisher of Celtic Family Magazine,
and founder of the Los Angeles St. Davids Day Festival.
He is known for founding the Los Angeles St. Davids Day Festival, one of the largest Welsh festivals of its kind in the United States, and founding the most widely distributed print publication based in the United States about Celtic cultures and interests.
In 2014 he won the Eisteddfod Honorary Recognition for Bardic Achievements.

Morgan-Richards was born in Beebetown, Ohio and is of Welsh people Welsh, Swiss (Amish) and Indigenous peoples of the Americas Native American descent.
==Early years==
Richards was raised in an old converted school house in Beebetown, Ohio. His mother (a student of fine art) taught him the basics of drawing and music composition on the family pump organ. Richards also credited his imagination on the plentiful books his family owned, creative isolation, and the sheer number of animals they took care of, many of which he incorporated into his early drawings and writings.
Richards interest in Native Americans in the United States Native American and American frontier American Western history began in childhood. “I remember my first book as a child was The Indians Knew by Tillie S. Pine, an early reader from 1965 explaining the cultural ways and historical resourcefulness of Native Americans and how they are applied in the sciences today.”
When Richards entered second grade, he was diagnosed with a form of dyslexia that required tutoring through the ninth grade. By his early teens, he was reading and became inspired by Edward Lear, L. Frank Baum, Roald Dahl, and Lewis Carroll; helping him overcome his reading disability.
Richards Great Uncle was Elliott D. Canonge who worked with the Comanche and Inuit. On his mother’s side, Richards ancestor was the 19th-century Welsh-American poet Robert Dennison Morgan.
Roberts father (Richards direct ancestor) John Morgan left the Tredegar area of Wales and emigrated to southern Ohio in the early part of the 1800s.
==Theater==

During this time, Richards also achieved minor success in producing music projects containing modern dance and theater, and befriended and collaborated with artist Textbeak. "I first attended Tri-C Western campus where my focus was on Liberal Arts. At the time, I kept a journal of random thoughts, doodles, and lyrics and used the filter of music as my art. So, the bulk of my classes were in this field of study. I made connections with other artists who shared similar passions, and we were all eager to form various projects of expression. I moved to Lakewood, Ohio Lakewood to be closer to the performance spaces and switched to Tri-C Metro where I was awakened out of my shell by an Anthropology teacher named Dr. Mark Lewine.”
In 1999, Richards solo album ENKI and subsequent live production were based on Zecharia Sitchins book The Twelfth Planet.
The show premiered in Cleveland, Ohio under the choreography of Michael Medcalf. Native American musical act Shouting Mountain opened the evening. In 2001, Richards followed the success of ENKI with the production of An Occurrence Remembered, influenced by the metaphysical war writings of Ambrose Bierce. The performance premiered in New York City.
Richards reflects on the performance: "Rehearsals were underway when 9-11 happened and I recall we continued only for our own therapy of the situation, knowing theater-goers were not going out. It was a tremendous performance, but it financially broke me."
Richards calls his synth music "Dark Electronic Storytelling" as it is conceptually based on written works and is meant for dramatic performance.
Richards announced on social media in June of 2018 that he was re-releasing previous albums and upcoming tracks under the new moniker Elder Moon.
==Writing career==
In 2002, Richards moved to Los Angeles to start over where he refocused his artistic direction into writing and illustrating, which he said: "did not need the expenses of my past but only a pen and paper."
While his novel Me’ma and the Great Mountain (2012) began drafts as early as 2002, it was Simon Snootle and Other Small Stories that became his first book release in 2009.
The following year Richards delivered four new releases including his second book of short stories in A Boy Born from Mold and Other Delectable Morsels.

Richards conceptualized most of The Goodbye Family characters in 2009 during a trip to the UK and France with his wife, although they were mentioned before this in his western novel Me’ma and the Great Mountain. Richards explains "I took a diary on the trip in order to write my second novel The Goodbye Family.File:Orphie Goodbye Family Lorin Morgan-Richards.jpg thumb Orphie from The Goodbye Family by Lorin Morgan-Richards  
       
The Goodbye family consisted of undertakers Otis and Pyridine, their daughter Orphie and her pet tarantula Dorian. Orphie was first seen atop the Notre Dame Cathedral with gargoyles, Otis was trying to board a train at customs with a shrunken head, Pyridine was sewing a limb back together in Cardiff, and Dorian was capturing a fairy to eat. Following these illustrations, a cat Ouiji was unveiled and Orphie is said to have a brother named Kepla, but he is hardly ever seen and it is unclear if he even exists."
Between 2009 and 2013, Richards was bookbinding his limited edition versions of each title with runs equaling 50 to 400. These collectible books were typically Oversewn binding oversewn by hand with a faux leather hard backing and linen pages inside. In an interview he states:

"Having seen what is being printed by majors these days with poor quality paper, I wanted to provide the reader with a book that carries more value near the same price and that can last for generations. Nothing would be more inspiring to me than to know my books are treasured like an heirloom."

Stylistically, Richards prefers a pencil and ink approach to his illustrations, and his writing often has elements of dark satire.
In 2015 Richards began two weekly cartoons on Steamkat, a comic strip site, The Goodbye Family and The Noodle Rut.
Richards won the 2016 Official Tasty Nugget award for his illustrated story Sad Lost Doll.

===Marcil d’Hirson Garron===
In February 2018, artwork started daily on social media under the name Marcil d’Hirson Garron, with the artist coining their style as Imperfectualism (art that cannot be easily replicated by machine). Likewise, Garron adopted the label Imperfectualism Imperfectualist (an artist that looks to slow automation through their art). The artwork is free of precision and appears as minimalistic inked line drawings, however detail is seen  hidden between the lines.
Links point to an association between Richards and Garron. Garron was first mentioned in Richards series The Goodbye Family as  Orphie’s favorite artist.
Further, Marcil d’Hirson Garron is an anagram of Lorin Morgan-Richards.

==A Raven Above Press==
A Raven Above Press was founded in 2009 by Richards with a focus on printing his illustrated stories and promoting other authors and illustrators of Celtic and Native American origin. The press also became a catalyst for producing cultural events and art exhibits. Notably, the Los Angeles St. Davids Day Festival.
On August 1, 2013, Celtic Family Magazine hit the newsstands with a release party in Cardiff, Wales.
Richards was the founder and publisher of Celtic Family Magazine from its inception in 2013 to its hiatus in 2017.

The logo for A Raven Above Press displays a raven atop a bending Cupressus sempervirens cypress tree. Model Wednesday Mourning has appeared in the main ad for A Raven Above Press,
as well as Morgan-Richards daughter Berlin in her traditional Welsh dress.

Richards would produce a book for every Welsh event he curated through A Raven Above Press. Outside of including his own illustration, these books often had American and Welsh artists depict the subject matter. Notable artists involved were Jen Delyth, Ruth Jên, Siobhan Owen, Monica Richards, Nichola and Sarah Hope, and Nathan Wyburn to name a few. The following is a list of these books:

===Native American Involvement===
File:Lorin Morgan-Richards speaking at Bringing the Circle Together.jpg thumb Lorin Morgan-Richards speaking at Bringing the Circle Together Richards speaking on the history books he read in grade school: "Usually the pictures told much more about American history than the text. I remembered seeing at a very early age a glowing photo of Custer and a few pages after (of) an elderly man, who looked like my own grandfather, lying dead in the snow. He was alone, and without care. I later found out his name was Miniconjou chief Spotted Elk (Bigfoot) and he was part of the massacre at Wounded Knee. That photo has always stuck with me. I knew something was not right, and the text which was alongside it was not giving the full story."
Richards received a Bachelor Degree BA Degree in Anthropology at California State University, Los Angeles, where he focused on cultural studies (specifically Indigenous peoples of the Americas). To help pay for school, Richards worked at an art gallery in Westwood, California Westwood and later at the Southwest Museum of the American Indian store where he assisted setting up gallery shows including works by Russell Means.  On February 11, 2008, Richards met Dennis Banks and was in support of American Indian Movement The Longest Walk 2 starting on Alcatraz Island.  Around this time, Richards attended a conference in Cleveland, Ohio on Native American mascot controversy Native mascots hosted by brothers Vernon Bellecourt and Clyde Bellecourt, and also credits hearing John Trudell speak at his university as influential to his life.

Richards volunteered at Haramokngna American Indian Cultural Center in the Angeles National Forest, where he researched and wrote about the Indigenous plants and their uses amongst the local tribes of Southern California. Botanist author Frank Acuna and Tataviam tribal leader Rudy Ortega Sr. were vital in this process and its use by the center for a trail guide.

====Bringing the Circle Together====
{{Main Bringing the Circle Together}}
File:Western childrens author Lorin Morgan-Richards with his daughter Berlin.jpg thumb Lorin Morgan-Richards with his daughter Berlin Between 2008 and 2012, Richards partnered with Native Americans in the United States Native American and Indigenous groups in Los Angeles to establish Bringing the Circle Together,
a free monthly film series hosted at the Japanese American National Museum. The series offered a central gathering place to screen documentaries by and about Indigenous people while providing historical narratives with guest speakers, and art and cultural demonstrations. Special guests included Makana (musician) Makana, Saginaw Grant, Douglas Miles, Blase Bonpane, among others.

The film series in partnership with AIM Santa Barbara held a community birthday celebration at Nahui Ohlin in Los Angeles for Leonard Peltier on September 12, 2009, with an update on his status and how the public could get involved to petition his release. Richards spoke to a reporter: "This is all grassroots. Everyones voice counts. The time is now because Barack Obama, our president, had said its not the president that actually makes the change, its going to be our pressure upon the president that will make the change."
The event was followed in December by a screening of Warrior: The Life of Leonard Peltier with discussion afterward by Ben Carnes, members of AIM Santa Barbara, as well as friends and family.
History was made at the film series on February 25, 2010, at the screening of Lost Nation: The Ioway when representatives of the Ioway Southern Ioway and Ioway Northern Ioway tribes gathered with Tongva people Tongva leaders, making it the first time a meeting took place between Southern California and Midwestern Native American Nations.
In 2015, Richards published a free journal entitled Bringing the Circle Together Magazine featuring interviews with contemporary Native American leaders Joanne Shenandoah, Greg Grey Cloud, and L. Frank.

===Celtic Involvement===
File:Author and illustrator Lorin Morgan-Richards in Old Town San Diego (33520541991).jpg thumb Author and illustrator Lorin Morgan-RichardsRichards became heavily involved in the Welsh-American community after the untimely closure of the Welsh Presbyterian Church (Los Angeles) Welsh Presbyterian Church in December 2012. Before this, Richards had helped coordinate an Eisteddfod at Barnsdall Art Park in 2011. Feeling a need to fill the void of losing the church as a cultural center, Richards founded the Los Angeles St. Davids Day Festival, an annual event taking place on or around March 1 celebrating Wales. The first festival took place on March 1, 2013. Singer and harpist Siobhan Owen headlined the large-scale event. In conjunction with the festival, Richards began producing Celtic Family Magazine, a nationally distributed print and digital publication on Celtic interests.
In the summer of 2015, Richards invited members of the community to form the Welsh League of Southern California which took on the responsibility of the festival and other events in the area. Celtic Family Magazine announced its hiatus in 2017 due to increased production costs.

Richards has since refocused his energy into writing and illustrating full-time.

==Words and phrases coined==
Several words and phrases coined or adopted by Richards have passed into English usage:File:Down_West_by_Lorin_Morgan-Richards.jpg thumb right Down West by Lorin Morgan-Richards
* Down West, a type of the subgenre of Weird West depicting macabre western humor as seen in his series The Goodbye Family. The term is also from Richards cartoon collection of the same name.
* Bratniks, as a pejorative social epithet referring to Generation Z for their quick access to technology and knowledge. Richards playfully explains: "While the beatniks had On the Road the Bratniks have ‘On the Phone’. The ironic twist is that neighboring generations can easily be sucked into Generation Z like a black hole – making it very hard to differentiate what time and place you originated. Considering, maybe it’s not so bad after all."
===As Marcil d’Hirson Garron===
* Imperfectualism: (is) art that cannot be easily replicated by machine. An imperfectualist looks to slow automation through their art. As coined by Marcil d’Hirson Garron.
