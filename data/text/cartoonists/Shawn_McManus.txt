==Comics==
Born in Brookline, Massachusetts, McManus entered the comics field in the early 1980s with work for Heavy Metal (magazine) Heavy Metal and DC Comics.
For the June 1983 issue of Heavy Metal he collaborated with Bhob Stewart and John Coffey on "Zenobia". Six months later, McManus and Stewart teamed with Jim McDermott (illustrator) Jim McDermott on "Symbiosis", also in Heavy Metal (December 1983).
He drew the Green Arrow backup feature in Detective Comics in 1983-1984.
McManus gained wider attention when he illustrated two issues of Swamp Thing (comic book) The Saga of the Swamp Thing written by Alan Moore.

McManus worked with writer Todd Klein on Omega Men,
creating Zirral and other characters for that series. He has drawn issues of Doctor Fate and Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight.
He collaborated with Neil Gaiman on the "The Sandman: Fables &amp; Reflections Fables &amp; Reflections" and "The Sandman: A Game of You A Game of You" story arcs

McManus artwork for Marvel Comics includes Peter Parker: Spider-Man Annual 97 and Daredevil (Marvel Comics series) Daredevil #351.
In an interview, John Rozum, who scripted that issue of Daredevil, recalled:
:I thought Shawn McManuss art was great. Id like to work with him again sometime, though we didnt really work together here. At the time I wrote it, I had no idea whod be drawing it. Shawn and I have never even met or spoken with each other. I always write full script though, and unlike some other artists, Shawn actually pays attention to the script. I think his artwork was a nice pairing with the story.
McManus has contributed to titles from a variety of other publishers, including Atomeka Press (A1 (comic) A1), Dark Horse Comics (Cheval Noir (comics) Cheval Noir), Exhibit A Press (Supernatural Law Wolff &amp; Byrd: Counselors of the Macabre), First Comics (Grimjack), Image Comics (Supreme (comics) Supreme), Malibu Comics (The Man Called A-X), and DC Comics Paradox Press (The Big Book Of Freaks). He worked on Leah Moore and John Reppions Wild Girl (comics) Wild Girl (Wildstorm, 2004â€“2005) with J. H. Williams III, about 13-year-old Rosa Torez who discovers that she can communicate with animals. In 2007, he did an eight-issue run on Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis and an issue of Creeper (comics) The Creeper for DC.
He illustrated Cinderella: From Fabletown with Love in 2010
and Cinderella: Fables Are Forever the following year.
He was one of several artists to contribute to the Fairest in All the Land graphic novel.
==Childrens art==
Writer-illustrator and lecturer Mark McKenna, creator of the Banana Tail childrens book series, described his long association with McManus that led to their Banana Tail: The Early Years (2009) color print:
:I met Shawn McManus in the DC Comics offices back in late 1985. I was up at DC Comics to meet with an editor or show samples, I forget, the old brain is failing me here. But I do recall Shawn sitting in with the editor who I was about to have a meeting with. At the time, Shawn was drawing Swamp Thing, and I was delighted to see his lively, bouncy and very refreshing art style. Little did I know that within a year we would be an art team along with writer J. M. DeMatteis on DCs Doctor Fate series... We worked together for six months on Doctor Fate until the DC editor moved me to another book. I havent had any creative contact with Shawn since that time in 1987. We really never spoke during the time we worked together. I was still very new to the business and didnt think to call and collaborate with Shawn to get his sensibilities about direction and vision for the book. No contact with Shawn until a few brief comic con "how ya doings?", and an eventual reconnect through our mutual art rep, Bob Shaw... Bob had this idea that Shawn should work with me and create some ultra cool Banana Tail painting... Seeing Bob Shaws excitement, Shawn then saw the potential in Banana Tail.
==Television==
In 1987, McManus worked on the animated series Dinosaucers. For the TV series Tales from the Crypt (TV series) Tales from the Crypt, McManus and Mike Vosburg illustrated comic book covers designed to look like the original Tales from the Crypt (comics) 1950s comics. The McManus Crypt cover is seen in the first episode ("The Man Who Was Death").

==Awards==
1985 Kirby Award Jack Kirby Award nomination with Alan Moore for Best Single Issue ("Pog" in The Saga of the Swamp Thing #32).
