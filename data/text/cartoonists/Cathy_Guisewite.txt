Cathy Lee Guisewite (born September 5, 1950) is an American cartoonist who created the comic strip Cathy (comic strip) Cathy, which had a 34-year run. The strip focused on a career woman facing the issues and challenges of eating, work, relationships and having a mother—or as the character put it in one strip, "the four basic guilt groups."

==Early life==
Guisewite was born in Dayton, Ohio Dayton, Ohio
to William L. and Anne Guisewite. She was raised in Midland, Michigan Midland, Michigan with older sister [http://fineartamerica.com/profiles/mary-anne-nagy.html?tab=artwork Mary Anne Nagy] and younger sister Mickey. Guisewite graduated from Midland High School (Midland, Michigan) Midland High School in 1968. 

She attended the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Michigan Ann Arbor, where she was a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority.  In 1972, she earned a bachelors degree in English language English.

==Career==
After college, Guisewite followed her fathers vocation and began working in advertising
at Campbell-Ewald, then Norman Prady before settling at Doner Company W.B. Doner &amp; Co. near Detroit. She became a vice president of the firm in 1976.
<!--Guisewites first cartoon strip Roxbury (syndicated by Copley News Service for Early Cartoons) was published from 1963 to 1973. REMOVED --  no reference, and if she was so flabbergasted to be published with _Cathy_, it doesnt make that much sense she would have already had a long-running title.-->
She continued to draw funny pictures as an "emotional coping mechanism" to events in her life and work, and she would forward them to her parents.
Her mother kept urging her to send them to a publisher, so finally, she did. "My entire goal with my submission package was to get my mother off my back. My goal was not to do a comic strip. It was to make Mom quit telling me I could do a comic strip."
Guisewite was flabbergasted when the company sent her a contract to produce a comic strip. Cathy was Print syndication syndicated to 66 newspapers in 1976
by Universal Press Syndicate, now Universal Uclick,
and Guisewite did both—her advertising job during the day, and comics at night. By 1980, the strip was carried by 150 dailies and she was earning $50,000 per year for Cathy,
so she finally quit the advertising business to work on Cathy full-time and moved to Santa Barbara, California.
The comic strip was a "running social commentary"
for her confusion. Guisewite explained, "You were a liberated woman or you were or a traditionalist. To even voice vulnerability if you were a feminist was wrong and to voice interest in liberation if you were a more traditional woman was wrong. So I believe the women I was speaking to in the early years of my strip were women like me, who were at that age in our 20s where we were kind of launched into adulthood with a foot in both worlds and no way to really express it.”
Guisewite appeared several times as a guest on the late night TV series The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.
At the peak of the strips popularity in the mid-1990s, it appeared in almost 1,400 papers.
However, on August 11, 2010, Guisewite announced the strips retirement after 34 years. Its run ended on October 3, 2010 (a Sunday comics Sunday strip).
==Awards==
In 1987, she received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program for the TV special Cathy (TV special) Cathy, which aired on CBS. 

Guisewite is a member of the National Cartoonists Society and received in 1993 their highest honor, the Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year for her work of 1992.

Guisewite has been granted three honorary degrees from Russell Sage College, Rhode Island College and Eastern Michigan University.
==Personal==

Guisewite adopted daughter Ivy in 1992, then married screenwriter Christopher Wilkinson in 1997. Wilkinson has a son, Cooper, but the couple had no children together.
Guisewite and Wilkinson divorced in 2010.
One of Guisewites classmates at University of Michigan was screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan. When Kasdans movie The Big Chill (film) The Big Chill (1983) opened, Guisewite devoted an entire week of Cathy strips to it, with Cathy and her co-workers enthusing over the film and seeing it repeatedly.
