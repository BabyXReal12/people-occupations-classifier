During his twenties, he worked for Al Capp and his brother Elliott Caplin at the Capp family-owned Toby Press.<ref name=NYtimes /> In the early 1950s, he created two childrens comic strips, Wee Women and Lil Ones.<ref name=NYtimes/>

His comic strip Momma debuted on October 26, 1970. Although Lazarus based the title character on his own mother, she believed the character was based on his aunt, exclaiming, "You caught Aunt Helen to a tee!"<ref name=toon>{{cite web  url=http://www.toonopedia.com/momma.htm  title= Momma  publisher=Don Marksteins Toonopedia first=Don last=Markstein  accessdate=October 28, 2009  archivedate=March 9, 2016  archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6frtnMCLh?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/momma.htm  deadurl=no  df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 1964, Lazarus talked about his background and working methods:
{{quote I never actually graduated high school. My art teacher flunked me. I have since, however, attended many classes of one kind or another. I frequently lecture at colleges and to other groups around the country. I sold my first cartoon when I was 16. I did commercial art and edited children’s magazines prior to February 4, 1957 when my comic, Miss Peach, was launched. The characters in Miss Peach are not actually modeled on real persons, with the possible exception of Lester, the skinny kid in the strip. Possibly the most loved character is Arthur, the dopey little kid. I make notes all week based on thoughts, conversational fragments, etc. I sift through all these notes on Monday mornings and select several to develop. I then write gags for them. I do six daily strips and a Sunday strip Sunday page.<ref>{{cite book last=Willette first= Allen title=These Top Cartoonists Tell How They Create Americas Favorite Comics publisher=Allied Publications year= 1964}}</ref><!--published before ISBN numbers-->}}
