==BONZZO The Comic Strip==
Since he was young, Rivas had on his mind the development  of a cartoon character. After he developed the character, he used it to promote his advertising agency. A few years later, the character which he named BONZZO was officially born.<ref name=PRDS11092011-web>{{cite news last=Leonard first=H.J. title=From the newspaper to the web: BONZZO goes to cyberspace date=9 November 2011 newspaper=Puerto Rico Daily Sun url=http://www.bonzzo.com/PRDS-11092011-From%20the%20newspaper%20to%20the%20web%20BONZZO%20goes%20to%20cyberspace.html}}</ref>

There are no syndicates in the United States U.S. or Puerto Rico, but BONZZO was first published in 1998 in two of the four leading newspapers in Puerto Rico, El Mundo (Puerto Rico) El Mundo and El Vocero. His comic strips were published in both newspapers daily. Later, it was also published in El Reportero (North Alabama newspaper) El Reportero newspaper in Huntsville, Alabama. It was also published, years later, in the Primera Hora (Puerto Rico) Primera Hora newspaper in Puerto Rico.<ref>{{cite news last=Aponte Alequín first=Héctor title=Les sacan punta a las cosas simples url=http://johnrivaspublicidad.com/PH-12052006-Les%20sacan%20punta%20a%20las%20cosas%20simples.html newspaper=Primera Hora date=December 5, 2006}}</ref> As of 2012,  BONZZO (comic strip) BONZZO{{}}s daily comic strip may be viewed at his website.<ref name=PRDS11092011-web/>

Rivas describes "BONZZO" as a young likable adult facing life with a childs mentality. Rivas designed some special "BONZZO" strips commemorating NASAs achievements, including "Beyond the Moon", a calendar of the year 2000 honoring Hispanic heritage.<ref name="HHP">[http://www.hispaniconline.com/hh04/culture/building_character.html Hispanic Heritage Plaza] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222170151/http://www.hispaniconline.com/hh04/culture/building_character.html  date=2015-12-22 }}</ref>

While U.S. syndication is one of Rivass immediate goals, he also hopes to create a "BONZZO (comic strip) BONZZO" theme park, "Bonzzolandia".<ref name="HHP"/>

Andreu García also commented, "Every time I become a greater a fan of John Rivas and his character BONZZO".<ref name=JuezAndreu/>

Dr. Osiris Delgado (painter, art critic, educator, writer, and former Director of the Museum of Art, History and Anthropology of the University of Puerto Rico), recognized the work of John Rivas and BONZZO, saying:

"John Rivas, artist of the ironical subtlety, has Bonzzo as an accomplice to peek into the world with a spirit of fine joke, quality of expression, ability to sneak into people, things and situations, take secrets, project teachings, make us laugh and give us lessons. For Puerto Rico, I give my vote to Bonzzo."<ref name=OsirisDelgadoRecognition/>

Also, painter Antonio J. Molina, who is a member of AICA (International Association of Art Critics) and President of the Puerto Rican Association of the UNESCO, said:
"Bonzzo is already a known figure in the history of Puerto Rico. With his sympathetic round face he distributes joy by the handful among those who know him... and also helps us to think. With his jokes, grace and wise irony he teaches us aspects and situations of life, which sometimes may escape from us, in a world that goes so fast and distrustful."<ref name=AntonioJMolina/>

==Awards and recognitions==
During his professional career Rivas has won several awards and recognitions from various organizations.
