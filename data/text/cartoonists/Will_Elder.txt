William Elder (born Wolf William Eisenberg; September 22, 1921 â€“ May 15, 2008)
was an American illustrator and comic book artist who worked in numerous areas of commercial art but is best known for a frantically funny cartoon style that helped launch Harvey Kurtzmans Mad (magazine) Mad comic book in 1952.

Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner said, "He was a zany, and a lovable one."
