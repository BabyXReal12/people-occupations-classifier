Tom Bunk (born 1945{{citation needed date=April 2017}}) is a lifetime award-winning cartoonist known for adding multiple extraneous details to his posters, cartoons and illustrations created for both American and German publishers.

==Early life==
Tomas Maria Bunk was born in Split (city) Split, Croatia. He studied stage design and fine art at the Academy of Arts in Hamburg, Germany.{{citation needed date=April 2017}}

==Career==
In 1973, he moved to Berlin, where he began rendering humorous subjects in oil paintings. After selling these paintings in three successful shows, he turned to cartooning and contributed to underground comics in 1976.
His cartoon creations appeared monthly in the satirical magazine Pardon, other European comic magazines and comic anthologies. After collecting his comics in three books, he moved to New York in 1983 and began drawing for Raw, the graphic story magazine edited and published by Fran√ßoise Mouly and Art Spiegelman. He drew Topps trading cards, including Wacky Packages and Garbage Pail Kids. In 1990, he became a regular Mad (magazine) Mad cartoonist, and his contributions have led some to regard him as the modern-day replacement at Mad for Will Elder.
