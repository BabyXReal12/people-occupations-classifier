Zenas Winsor McCay ({{circa 1867–71}} – 1934) was an American cartoonist and animator.  He is best known for the comic strip Little Nemo (1905–14; 1924–26) and the animated film Gertie the Dinosaur (1914).  For contractual reasons, he worked under the pen name Silas on the comic strip Dream of the Rarebit Fiend.

From a young age, McCay was a quick, prolific, and technically dextrous artist.  He started his professional career making posters and performing for dime museums, and in 1898 began illustrating newspapers and magazines.  In 1903 he joined the New York Herald, where he created popular comic strips such as Little Sammy Sneeze and Dream of the Rarebit Fiend.  In 1905 his signature strip Little Nemo in Slumberland debuted—a fantasy strip in an Art Nouveau style about a young boy and his adventurous dreams.  The strip demonstrated McCays strong graphic sense and mastery of color and Perspective (graphical) linear perspective.  McCay experimented with the formal elements of the comic strip page, arranging and sizing panels to increase impact and enhance the narrative.  McCay also produced numerous detailed editorial cartoons and was a popular performer of chalk talks on the vaudeville circuit.

McCay was an early animation pioneer; between 1911 and 1921 he self-financed and animated ten films, some of which survive only as fragments.  The first three served in his vaudeville act; Gertie the Dinosaur was an interactive routine in which McCay appeared to give orders to a trained dinosaur.  McCay and his assistants worked for twenty-two months on his most ambitious film, The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918), a patriotic recreation of the Sinking of the RMS Lusitania German torpedoing in 1915 of the RMS Lusitania.  Lusitania did not enjoy as much commercial success as the earlier films, and McCays later movies attracted little attention.  His animation, vaudeville, and comic strip work was gradually curtailed as newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, his employer since 1911, expected McCay to devote his energies to editorial illustrations.

In his drawing, McCay made bold, prodigious use of linear perspective, particularly in detailed architecture and cityscapes.  He textured his editorial cartoons with copious fine hatching, and made color a central element in Little Nemo.  His comic strip work has influenced generations of cartoonists and illustrators.  The technical level of McCays animation—its naturalism, smoothness, and scale—was unmatched until the work of Fleischer Studios in the late 1920s, followed by The Walt Disney Company Walt Disneys feature films in the 1930s.  He pioneered inbetweening, the use of Printing registration registration marks, Traditional animation#Animation loops cycling, and other animation techniques that were to become standard.

==Personal history==

===Family history===
McCays paternal grandparents, farmers Donald and Christiana {{not a typo McKay}}, immigrated from Scotland to Upper Canada{{efn Upper Canada became the southern portion of the Canadian province of Ontario upon Canadian Confederation in 1867.}} in the mid-1830s.  McCays father, Robert {{not a typo McKay}} (1840 – March 21, 1915) was born in Woodstock, Ontario Woodstock, Upper Canada, the third of six children.  McCays maternal grandparents, Peter and Mary Murray, were also Scottish immigrants, and settled as farmers in East Zorra-Tavistock East Zorra in Upper Canada.  Their daughter Janet was the third of nine children.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=21}}

Robert was a member of King Solomons No. 43 Masonic Lodge in Woodstock.{{sfn Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon 2002}}  In 1862, Robert first traveled to the U.S.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=22}}  Robert and the twenty-five-year-old Janet married on January 8, 1866, at Woodstocks Methodist Episcopal Church.  The couple moved across the Canada–US border later in the year and settled in Spring Lake, Michigan, on the eastern coast of Lake Michigan.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=21}}  Robert was employed by American entrepreneur Zenas G. Winsor (1814–1890), with whom he had made contact in Canada.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=22}}

Records of McCays birth are not extant.  He stated in an interview in 1910 that he was born in 1869, and this is the year listed on his grave marker. {{not a typo Late}} in life, he told friends he was born September 26, 1871, in Spring Lake, and they published this information in a magazine.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=22}}  Michigan census records from 1870 and 1880 list a Zenas W. {{not a typo McKay}}, who was born in Canada in 1867.{{sfnm 1a1=Canemaker 1y=2005 1p=22 2a1=Bien 2y=2011 2p=123}}  No Canadian birth record has been found, and a fire in Spring Lake in May 1893 could have destroyed any American birth record he may have had.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=22}}  His obituary in the New York Herald Tribune stated, "not even Mr. McCay knew his exact age".{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=46}}

The McCays had two more children: Arthur in 1868, and Mae in 1876.  Both were born in Michigan.  Robert worked as a teamster under Winsor, and by May 1870 had saved enough money to buy a parcel of land.  From 1879 to 1881 he worked as a retail grocer.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=22}}  In 1885 he moved the family to Stanton, Michigan, and expanded his land holdings; he was successful in real estate with his brother Hugh, who moved from {{not a typo Canada}}
<!-- not Upper Canada by this point -->
in 1887.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=23}}

By 1905, Robert was also a notary public.  He had settled in Edmore, Michigan, and by this point had changed the spelling of his surname from "McKay" to "McCay".{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=23}}  His son related this story about the change:

{{Quote "Three Scotsmen of the Clan Mackay clan McKay were looking for a fourth member to fight four members of the Irish clan Magee ... Im not one of you, my father pointed out.  You see, Im one of the clan M-{{not a typo c}}-C-A-Y.  And that is how I got both my name and my sense of humor." Winsor McCay{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=23}} }}

===Early life===
{{Quote box
 quote  = "I just couldnt stop drawing anything and everything."
 source = Winsor McCay{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=23}} }}

McCay came to be known by his middle name, Winsor. His drawing skills emerged early.  According to a story told within the family, McCay made his first drawing in the aftermath of one of the many fires that hit Spring Lake: he picked up a nail and etched the scene of the fire in the frost of a windowpane.  Drawing became obsessive for him;{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=23}} he drew anything he saw, and the level of detail and accuracy in his drawing was noted at a young age.  He was able to draw accurately from memory even things he had never before drawn—what McCay called "memory sketching".  His father thought little of his sons artistic talents, though,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=24}} and had him sent to Cleary University Cleary Business College in Ypsilanti, Michigan.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=28}}  McCay rarely attended classes.  He bragged about how he would catch the train to Detroit to show off his drawing skills at the Wonderland and Eden Musee dime museum.  He drew portraits there for 25{{Abbrlink ¢ cent (United States coin)}} apiece, of which he kept half.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 pp=28–29}}

McCay thrived on the attention he received, and his talents soon drew wider attention.  John Goodison, a geography and drawing professor at Eastern Michigan University Michigan state Normal School, offered to teach art to McCay privately, and McCay eagerly accepted.  The lessons were practical and focused on using observation to learn to draw in geometrical perspective (graphical) perspective.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=30}}  Goodison, a former stained glass glass stainer, influenced McCays use of color.  McCay learned how to draw quickly using drills on a blackboard, and gained an appreciation for master artists of the past.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=31}}

===Early career (1889–1903)===
McCay spent two years in Chicago{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=38}} after making his way there sometime in 1889 with his friend Mort Touvers.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=33}}  He traded art techniques there with painter Jules Guérin (artist) Jules Guérin, whom he met at a boarding house in which he lodged, and did artwork for posters and pamphlets at the National Printing and Engraving Company.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=34}}

Uncle Sam (representing the United States) gets entangled with rope around a tree labeled "Imperialism" while trying to subdue a bucking colt or mule labeled "Philippines" while a figure representing Spain walks off over the horizon. McCay did editorial cartoons early in his career (1899).

In 1891, McCay moved to Cincinnati, where he did more dime museum work{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=38}} while living in a boarding house near his workplace.  He spent nine years making posters and other advertisements for the Kohl &amp; Middleton Dime Museum,{{efn The Kohl &amp; Middleton Dime Museum was previously called the Vine Street Dime Museum.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=38}} }}{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=38}} and later Heck and Averys Family Theater (1896), Averys New Dime Museum (1898), and Will S. Hecks Wonder World and Theater (1899){{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=43}} on Vine Street, Cincinnati Vine Street.  At the museum in 1896, a demonstration of Thomas Edisons Vitascope was given, which was likely McCays first exposure to the young medium of film.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=40}}  He also did work during this time for Ph. Mortons printing and lithography company.  McCays ability to draw quickly with great accuracy drew crowds when he painted advertisements in public.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 pp=43–44}}

His first year at Kohl &amp; Middleton, McCay was smitten when Maude Leonore Dufour walked into the dime museum with her sister while he was painting.  He rushed to his studio to change into a custom-tailored suit, returned, and introduced himself to the fourteen-year-old Maude.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=45}}  Soon they Elopement (marriage) eloped in Covington, Kentucky.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=46}}

McCay began working on the side for the Cincinnati Commercial Tribune, where he learned to draw with a dip pen under the tutelage of Commercial Tribune art room manager Joseph Alexander.  In 1898, he accepted a full-time position there.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=47}}  His many illustrations for the paper displayed his bold use of perspective and mastery of Hatching hatchwork.  Soon after, he began Freelancer freelancing for the humor magazine Life (magazine)#Humor and general interest magazine Life as well.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=48}}

In 1900, McCay accepted a position with a higher salary at The Cincinnati Enquirer.  There, he produced a prolific number of drawings, did some reporting, and became head of the art department.  In his drawings, he began using line thickness to indicate depth, and used thick lines to surround his characters in an Art Nouveau-inspired style that became a trademark of his work.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=57}}

From January until November 1903, McCay drew an ongoing proto-comic strip for the Enquirer based on poems written by George Randolph Chester called A Tale of the Jungle Imps by Felix Fiddle.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=60}}  Before the last two installments appeared in print, McCay had moved to New York City to work for James Gordon Bennett, Jr.s New York Herald,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=64}} at first doing illustrations and editorial cartoons.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=71}}  He worked alongside comic strip pioneer Richard F. Outcault, who was doing the Buster Brown strip at the Herald.  A rivalry built up between the two cartoonists which resulted in Outcault leaving the Herald to return to his previous employer, William Randolph Hearst at New York Journal-American The New York Journal.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=74}}

McCays first continuing comic strip, Mr. Goodenough, debuted in the Evening Telegram on January 21, 1904.  The formula for the strip was that a sedentary millionaire would seek ways to become more active, with embarrassing results.  Sisters Little Sisters Beau, McCays first strip with a child protagonist, lasted one installment that April, and his first color strip, Phurious Phinish of Phoolish Philipes Phunny Phrolics, appeared in the Herald{{}}s Sunday supplement that May.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=75}}

McCays first popular comic strip was Little Sammy Sneeze.  The strip starred a young boy whose sneeze would build panel by panel until it was released, with explosively disastrous results, for which he was usually punished or chased away by those affected.  The strip debuted in July 1904 and ran until December 1906.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=75}}

McCays longest-running strip, Dream of the Rarebit Fiend, first appeared in the Evening Telegram in September 1904.  The strip was aimed at an adult audience,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=78}} and had no recurring characters.  The characters that appeared in the strip would have fantastic, sometimes terrifying dreams, only to wake up in the last panel, cursing the Welsh rarebit they had eaten the night before, which they blamed for bringing on the dream.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=79}}  Rarebit Fiend was so popular that a book collection appeared in 1905 from publisher Frederick A. Stokes.  It was adapted to film by Edwin Stanton Porter Edwin S. Porter, and plans were made for a "comic opera or musical extravaganza" for stage that failed to materialize.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=78}}  McCay signed the Rarebit Fiend strips with the pen name "Silas", as his contract required that he not use his real name for his Evening Telegram work.{{sfn Dover editors 1973 p=ix}}

The McCays had been living in Manhattan, close to the Herald offices; before 1905 they moved to Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn, New York, a seaside resort on Long Island.  It was an hour commute from the Herald offices, but they believed it to be a better place to raise children.  They lived at a number of addresses before settling into a three-story house at 1901 Voorhies Avenue, where McCay resided for the rest of his life.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 pp=125–126}}  As his reputation grew, his employers allowed him to work from his home studio more often.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=127}}

While still turning out illustrations and editorial cartoons daily,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=87}} McCay began three more continuing strips in 1905.  In January, he began The Story of Hungry Henrietta, in which the child protagonist visibly ages week by week, and eats compulsively in lieu of the love she craves from her parents.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=92}}  A Pilgrims Progress by Mister Bunion was another "Silas" strip for the Evening Telegram, which ran from June 1905 until December 1910.  Mr. Bunion spent each strip unsuccessfully scheming to rid himself of his suitcase, labeled "Dull Care".{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=94}}

McCay got "an idea from the Rarebit Fiend to please the little folk",{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=87}} and in October 1905 the full-page Sunday comics Sunday strip Little Nemo Little Nemo in Slumberland debuted in the Herald.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=97}}  Considered McCays masterpiece,{{sfnm 1a1=Harvey 1y=1994 1p=21 2a1=Hubbard 2y=2012 3a1=Sabin 3y=1993 3p=134 4a1=Dover editors 4y=1973 4p=vii 5a1=Canwell 5y=2009 5p=19}} its child protagonist had fabulous dreams, interrupted each week with his awakening in the final panel.{{sfn Harvey 1994 p=21}}  Nemos appearance was based on McCays son Robert.{{sfn Crafton 1993 p=97}}  McCay experimented with formal aspects of the comics page: he made inventive use of timing and pacing, the size and shape of panels, perspective, and architectural and other details.{{sfn Harvey 1994 p=21}}  The Herald was considered to have the highest quality color printing of any newspaper at the time; its printing staff used the Ben-Day dots Ben Day process for color,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=94}} and McCay annotated the Nemo pages with precise color schemes for the printers.{{sfnm 1a1=Harvey 1y=1994 1p=22 2a1=Canemaker 2y=2005 2p=107}}

Impresario Frederick Freeman Proctor F. F. Proctor approached McCay in April 1906 to perform chalk talks for the vaudeville circuit.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=131}}  For $500 per week he was to draw twenty-five sketches in fifteen minutes before live audiences, as a pit band played a piece called "Dream of the Rarebit Fiend".
<!-- Canemaker says it was written by Fred Day, but all other sources I have say it was by Thomas W. Thurban.  Were there two such pieces? -->
{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=132}}  In his The Seven Ages of Man routine, he drew two faces and progressively aged them.{{sfn Stabile Harrison 2003 p=3}}  His first performance was on June 11, 1906,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=132}} in a show that also featured entertainer W. C. Fields.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=132}}  It was a success, and McCay toured with the show throughout 1907,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=135}} while managing to complete his comic strip and illustration work on time, often working in hotel rooms or backstage.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=137}}

File:Little Nemo score cover.jpg thumb left alt=Little Nemo characters ascending a staircase Cover to the score of the extravagantly expensive Little Nemo stage musical, 1908

As early as 1905, several abortive attempts were made to produce a stage version of Little Nemo.  In mid-1907, Marcus Klaw and A. L. Erlanger announced they would put on an extravagant Little Nemo show for an unprecedented $100,000, with a score by Victor Herbert{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=141}} and lyrics by Harry B. Smith.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=141}}  It starred midget Gabriel Weigel as Nemo, Joseph Cawthorn as Dr. Pill, and Billy B. Van as Flip.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=143}}  Reviews were positive; it played to sold-out houses in New York and toured for two seasons.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=148}}  McCay brought his vaudeville act to each city where Little Nemo played.  When the Benjamin Franklin Keith Keith circuit{{efn Keith had partnered with Proctor in 1906.}} refused McCay to perform in Boston without a new act, McCay switched to the William Morris Endeavor William Morris circuit, with a $100-a-week raise.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=149}}  In several cities, McCay brought his son, who as publicity sat on a small throne dressed as Nemo.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=151}}

As part of an improvised story, Cawthorn introduced a mythical creature he called a "Whiffenpoof".  The word caught on with the public, and became the name of a s:The Whiffenpoof Song hit song and a The Whiffenpoofs singing group.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=143}}  Despite the shows success, it failed to make back its investment due to its enormous expenses{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=149}} and came to an end in December 1910.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=151}}

McCay displayed his Social consciousness social awareness in the last strip he created for the Herald, Poor Jake.  Its title character was a silent laborer who worked thanklessly for a Colonel and Mrs. Stall, who exploit him.  The strip ran from 1909 until spring 1911.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=121}}

McCay was approached in early 1910 to bring his vaudeville show to Europe.  McCay requested the Herald{{}}s permission, but the plans never materialized.  His show stayed within the eastern U.S. until he ceased performing in 1917.  Biographer John Canemaker assumed McCays request to tour Europe was turned down, and that the refusal added to McCays growing frustration with the Herald.  A distrust of big business became pronounced in McCays work around this time, including a story arc in Little Nemo in which the characters visit a Mars oppressed by a greedy business magnate.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 pp=151–153}}

===Animation (1911–1921)===
McCay said he was most proud of his animation work.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=153}} He completed ten animated films between 1911 and 1921,{{sfn Beckerman 2003 pp=18–19}} and three more were planned.{{sfn Harvey 1994 p=33}}

Inspired by the flip books his son brought home,{{sfnm 1a1=Beckerman 1y=2003 p=18 2a1=Canemaker 2y=2005 2p=157}} McCay "came to see the possibility of making moving pictures"{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=157}} of his cartoons.  He claimed to be "the first man in the world to make animated cartoons", though he was preceded by others such as James Stuart Blackton and Émile Cohl.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=157}}  McCay made four thousand drawings on rice paper for his first animated short, which starred his Little Nemo characters.  They were shot at Vitagraph Studios under Blacktons supervision.  Live-action sequences were added to the beginning and end of the film, in which McCay bets his newspaper colleagues that in one month he can make four thousand drawings that move.  Among those featured in these sequences were cartoonist George McManus and actor John Bunny.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=160}}  Little Nemo (1911 film) Little Nemo debuted in movie theatres on April 8, 1911, and four days later McCay began using it as part of his vaudeville act.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=160}}  Its good reception motivated him to hand-color each of the frames of the originally black-and-white animation.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=163}}

McCay had become frustrated with the Herald, partly over money issues{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=164}} and partly because he perceived a lack of freedom.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=153}}  He accepted a higher-paying offer in spring 1911 from Hearst at the New York Journal-American New York American and took Little Nemo{{}}s characters with him.  The Herald held the strips copyright,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=164}} but McCay won a lawsuit that allowed him to continue using the characters,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=168}} which he did under the title In the Land of Wonderful Dreams.  The Herald was unsuccessful in finding another cartoonist to continue the original strip.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=164}}

McCay began work that May on his next animated film, How a Mosquito Operates,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=164}} based on a Rarebit Fiend episode from June 5, 1909,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=167}} in which a man in bed tries in vain to defend himself from a giant mosquito, which drinks itself so full that it explodes.{{sfnm 1a1=Berenbaum 1y=2009 1p=138 2a1=Telotte 2y=2010 2p=54}}  The animation is naturalistic—rather than expanding like a balloon, with each sip of blood the mosquitos abdomen swells according to its body structure.{{sfnm 1a1=Barrier 1y=2003 1p=17 2a1=Canemaker 2y=2005 2p=165}}  The film was completed in January 1912,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=164}} and McCay toured with it that spring and summer.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=167}}

Gertie the Dinosaur debuted in February 1914 as part of McCays vaudeville act.  McCay introduced Gertie as "the only dinosaur in captivity",{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=175}} and commanded the animated beast with a whip.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=175}}  Gertie seemed to obey McCay, bowing to the audience, and eating a tree and a boulder, though she had a will of her own and sometimes rebelled.  When McCay admonished her, she cried.  McCay consoled her by throwing her an apple—in reality pocketing the cardboard prop apple as a cartoon one simultaneously appeared on screen.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=176}}  In the finale, McCay walked offstage, reappeared in animated form in the film, and had Gertie carry him away.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=177}}  Producer William Fox (producer) William Foxs Box Office Attractions obtained distribution rights to a modified version of Gertie that could be played in regular movie theaters.  This version was prefaced with a live-action sequence and replaced the interactive portions with intertitles.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=182}}

Gertie was McCays first piece of animation with detailed backgrounds.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=168}}  McCay drew the foreground characters, while art student neighbor John A. Fitzsimmons traced the backgrounds.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=169}}  McCay pioneered the "McCay Split System" of inbetweening, in which major poses or positions were drawn first, and the intervening frames drawn after.  This relieved tedium and improved the timing of the films actions.  McCay refused to patent his system,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=171}} and was sued in 1914 by animator John Randolph Bray,{{sfnm 1a1=Sito 1y=2006 1p=36 2a1=Canemaker 2y=2005 2p=172}} who took advantage of McCays lapse by patenting many of McCays techniques, including the use of Printing registration registration marks, tracing paper, the Mutoscope action viewer, and the Traditional animation#Animation loops cycling of drawings to create repetitive action.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=172}}  The lawsuit was unsuccessful, and there is evidence that McCay may have countersued — he thereafter received Royalties royalty payments from Bray for licensing the techniques.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=174}}

Hearst increased McCays salary to cover the loss of income.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=187}}

McCay was expected to report daily to the American building, where he shared a ninth-floor office with humorist Arthur "Bugs" Baer and sports cartoonist Joe McGurk.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=204}}  There, he illustrated editorials by Arthur Brisbane, who often sent back McCays drawings with instructions for changes.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=205}}  The quality of his drawings varied depending on his interest in the subject of the assignment,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=207}} whether or not he agreed with the sentiments portrayed,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=209}} and on events in his personal life.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=207}}  For example, in March 1914 he was subjected to a blackmail plot by a Mrs. Lambkin, who was seeking a divorce from her husband.  Lambkin alleged that McCays wife Maude was seeing her husband.  With McCays level of fame, such a story would likely be in the papers, and Mrs. Lambkin and her husband told McCay that she would keep it secret for $1,000.  McCay did not believe the allegations, and gave testimony at the Lambkins divorce trial.  The blackmail failed, and the divorce was not granted.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 pp=182–184}}

Hearst animation studio International Film Service began in December 1915, and brought Hearst cartoonists to the screen.  McCay was initially listed as one of them, but the studio never produced anything either by his hands or featuring his creations.  McCay derived satisfaction from doing the work himself.  Begun in 1916, The Sinking of the Lusitania was his follow-up to Gertie.  The film was not a fantasy but a detailed, realistic recreation of the Sinking of the RMS Lusitania 1915 German torpedoing of the RMS Lusitania RMS Lusitania.  The event counted 128 Americans among its 1,198 dead, and was a factor leading to the American entry into World War I.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=186}}

McCays daughter Marion married military man Raymond T. Moniz, eighteen years her senior, on October 13, 1917.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=212}}  She gave birth to McCays first grandchild, Ray Winsor Moniz, on July 16, 1918.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=212}}  Moniz and McCays son Robert were called up for service when the U.S. entered World War I.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=212}}

File:The Sinking of the Lusitania (Winsor McCay, signed cel).jpg right thumb alt=Cel from The Sinking of the Lusitania.  Smoke billows from the sinking RMS Lusitania. The Sinking of the Lusitania (1918) required 25,000 drawings to be made over two years, and was McCays first film to use acetate cels.

McCays self-financed Lusitania took nearly two years to complete.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=193}}  With the assistance of John Fitzsimmons and Cincinnati cartoonist William Apthorp "Ap" Adams, McCay spent his off hours drawing the film on sheets of cellulose acetate (or "cels") with white and black India ink at McCays home.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=188}}  It was the first film McCay made using cels,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=193}} a technology animator Earl Hurd had patented in 1914; it saved work by allowing dynamic drawings to be made on one or more layers, which could be laid over a static background layer, relieving animators of the tedium of retracing static images onto drawing after drawing.{{sfn Kundert-Gibbs Kundert-Gibbs 2009 p=46}}  McCay had the cels photographed at the Vitagraph studios.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=188}}  The film was naturalistically animated, and made use of dramatic camera angles that would have been impossible in a live-action film.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=196}}

Jewel Productions released the film on July 20, 1918.  Advertising touted it as "the picture that will never have a competitor";{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=193}} the film itself called McCay "the originator and inventor of

Cartoons"{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=193}} and drew attention to the fact that it took 25,000 drawings to complete.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=195}}  The Sinking of the Lusitania did not greatly return on McCays investment—after a few years run in theaters, it netted $80,000.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=193}}

McCay continued to produce animated films using cels.  By 1921, he had completed six, though three were likely never shown commercially to audiences and have survived only in fragments:  The Centaurs, Flips Circus, and Gertie on Tour.  In 1921, he released three films based on Dream of the Rarebit Fiend: Bug Vaudeville, in which insects and other creepy-crawlies perform on stage; The Pet, in which a creature with a bottomless appetite grows enormously and terrorizes the city in a way reminiscent of King Kong (1933 film) King Kong; and The Flying House, in which a man attaches wings to his house to flee from debt.  McCays son Robert is credited with the animation on this last film, but Canemaker notes it is highly unlikely that a first-time animator could have produced such an accomplished piece of animation.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 pp=197–198}}

===Later career (1921–1934)===
After 1921, McCay was made to give up on animation when Hearst learned he devoted more of his time to animation than to his newspaper illustrations.{{sfn Sito 2006 p=36}}  Unexecuted ideas McCay had for animation projects included a collaboration with Jungle Imps author George Randolph Chester, a musical film called The Barnyard Band,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=198}} and a film about the Americans role in World War I.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 pp=198, 217}}

McCays son Robert married Theresa "Tedda" Munchausen on April 9, 1921.  McCay bought them a nearby house as a wedding gift.  The couple gave McCay two more grandchildren: Janet (named after McCays mother) in 1922, and Robert in 1928.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=223}}  Robert suffered shell shock during World War I,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=216}} and following the war had difficulty drawing.  McCay tried to boost his sons confidence by finding him cartooning work, and some of the elder McCays editorial cartoons were signed "Robert Winsor McCay, Jr."{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=226}}

In 1922, McCay resumed doing vaudeville shows for the Keith circuit.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=225}}  He had a cameo in a newspaper office scene in the boxing film The Great White Way (1924 film) The Great White Way in early 1924.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=226}}

McCay left Hearst upon the expiration of his contract in May 1924, bitter over not having received a promised $5,000 bonus.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=228}}  He returned to the Herald Tribune, and brought back Little Nemo beginning that August.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=229}}  The new strip displayed the virtuoso technique of the old, but the panels were laid out in an unvarying grid.  Nemo took a more passive role in the stories,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=226}} and there was no continuity.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=235}}  The strip came to an end in December 1926,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=229}} as it was not popular with readers.  Hearst executives had been trying to convince McCay to return to the American, and succeeded in 1927.  While McCay was gone, his place had been filled by Mel Cummin, who was let go after McCays return.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=235}}  Due to the lack of the 1920s Nemos success, the Herald Tribune signed over all copyrights to the strip to McCay for one dollar.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=237}}

File:MaxFleischerPDUS.JPG thumb alt=Black and white phot of a moustachioed man In 1927 McCay expressed his diasappointment at the state of the animation industry at a dinner in his honor, where he was introduced by Max Fleischer (pictured).

In 1927, McCay attended a dinner in his honor in New York.  After a considerable amount of drinking, McCay was introduced by animator Max Fleischer.  McCay gave the gathered group of animators some technical advice, but when he felt the audience was not giving him attention, he berated his audience, saying, "Animation is an art.  That is how I conceived it.  But as I see, what you fellows have done with it, is making it into a trade.  Not an art, but a trade.  Bad Luck!"{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=199}}  That September he appeared on the radio at WRKO WNAC, and on November 2 he was interviewed by Frank Craven for The News Journal The Evening Journal{{}}s Womans Hour.  During both appearances he complained about the state of contemporary animation.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=239}}

An executive of the American Tobacco Company approached McCay in 1929 to do an advertising campaign for a financial "sum in excess of his annual salary".  Brisbane refused, noting that McCays contract didnt allow outside work.  When the executive stormed into Brisbanes office threatening to pull American Tobaccos advertising dollars from the American, Brisbane provided a written release for the work.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 pp=238–239}}

In 1932, McCay found himself in what he recalled as "the wildest ride" in his life when Hearsts son William Randolph Hearst, Jr. "Young Bill" drove him at {{convert 85 mph km/h}} to the scene of the Lindbergh kidnapping kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby.  They arrived there two hours after the crime was first reported to police, and were able to interview the gathered police before the grounds were closed off to the public.  McCay sketched the scene, the staff, and the ladders the kidnappers used, which he was allowed to see up close.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=240}}

McCay enjoyed robust health most of his life. On July 26, 1934, he complained to his wife of a severe headache. To his horror, he found his right arm—his drawing arm—was paralyzed.  He lost consciousness and was pronounced dead later that afternoon, with his wife, children, and son-in-law by his side.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=249}}  He had died of a embolism cerebral embolism,{{sfn Syracuse Herald staff 1934}} and was buried at the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn{{sfn Fodor 2001}} in a family plot.  He had a Masonic funeral in his home, attended by his newspaper colleagues, Hearst and his son, and the Society of Illustrators, among others.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=251}}

Brisbane hired back Mel Cummin to replace McCay.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=251}}  Due to his lavish lifestyle, McCay left a smaller fortune than those around him had expected.  By the early 1940s, Maude had used up her inheritance and sold the house on Voorhies Avenue.  When she died of a heart attack on March 2, 1949, she was living with her daughter and son-in-law.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=251}}  Son Robert was also careless with his inheritance, and less successful in art than his father.  He worked for a short time at the Hearst papers, and tried unsuccessfully to get a job at the Disney studios, before finding a career as illustrator for Training Aids/Special Services at Fort Ord.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 pp=251–252}}

==Personal life==
Self-conscious and introverted in private, McCay was nevertheless a charismatic showman and self-promoter,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 pp=40, 139}} and maintained several lifelong friendships.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=40}} McCay was a light but frequent drinker; he drank for comrade camaraderie rather than for a love of drinking.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=244}}  To his wifes chagrin, McCay was a smoker of cigars and cigarettes.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=202}} He was self-taught at the piano,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=202}} and was an avid reader of poetry, plays and novels; he admired W. B. Yeats, knew the works of Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats, and could quote the Bible and Shakespeare.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=244}}

McCay stood barely five feet ({{convert 5 ft cm disp=output only}}) tall,{{sfn Taylor 2007 p=555}} and felt dominated by his wife, who was nearly as tall as he was.{{sfnm 1a1=Canemaker 1y=2005 1p=45 2a1=Merkl 2y=2007 2p=512}}  McCay married Maude Leonore Dufour, the youngest of three daughters of French-Canadian carriage painter John Dufour.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=45}}  About a decade separated the couples ages:{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=45}} Maude was 14 when they married.
Biographer Canemaker speculates this may explain the lack of certainty behind McCays birthdate, even by McCay himself, as he may have claimed to be younger than he was to justify marrying a teenage girl.  Maude was also age-conscious: she preferred her grandchildren to call her "Nan" instead of "Grandma" and dyed her hair as she got older.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=46}}  The McCays took on the traditional roles of a married couple of the time, in that Winsor was the breadwinner and Maude the homemaker.  Neither spouse got along well with the others mother.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=202}}

The couple had two children: Bob McCay Robert Winsor, born June 21, 1896; and Marion Elizabeth, born August 22, 1897.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=47}}  McCay was said to be easygoing with the children, and left discipline to their stern mother.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=202}}  Marion felt domineered by her mother and perceived that her brother was her mothers favorite; she was closer to her father and often appeared in public with him.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=202}}  Robert looked up to his father and became an artist himself.  He was proud to have served as the model for Little Nemo.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=252}}

The McCays lived lavishly.  McCay disliked driving, so kept a chauffeur who also served as bodyguard, as the editorial cartoons McCay drew for Hearst sometimes attracted threatening letters.  Maude made daily trips by limousine to shop in upscale downtown Brooklyn with other well-to-do wives. Maude often complained to her husband, but he refused to discuss matters with her.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 pp=202–203}}

McCays politics are unclear, and it is disputed whether he sympathized with the viewpoints displayed in his editorial cartoons.{{sfn Shannon 2010 p=197}}  He was Agnosticism agnostic and believed in reincarnation.  He was a lifelong member of the Freemasonry Freemasons, which he may have joined as early as when he was living in Chicago.  His father had also been a Freemason, and was buried in 1915 with full Masonic rites,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=34}} with funerals arranged by his Masonic lodges in both Woodstock, Ontario, and Edmore, Michigan.  His mother often visited him in Brooklyn, and attended Little Nemo{{}}s Philadelphia premiere.  She died in Edmore, Michigan, in 1927.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=185}}

McCays brother Arthur was placed in a mental hospital in Traverse City, Michigan on March 7, 1898, where he stayed until his death from bronchopneumonia and arteriosclerosis on June 15, 1946.  He never received family visits.  McCay never let his children know about his brother, nor did they know about the existence of his sister Mae,{{sfn Canemaker 2005 pp=55–56}} who died in 1910.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=153}}

In 1937, McCays son Robert attempted to carry on his fathers legacy by reviving Little Nemo.  Comic book packager Harry "A" Cheslers syndicate announced a Sunday and daily Nemo strip, credited to "Winsor McCay, Jr."  Robert also drew a comic book version for Chesler called Nemo in Adventureland starring grown-up versions of Nemo and the Princess.  Neither project lasted long.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=253}}  In 1947, Robert and fabric salesman Irving Mendelsohn organized the McCay Feature Syndicate, Inc. to revive the original Nemo strip from McCays original art, modified to fit the size of modern newspaper pages.

McCay destroyed many of his original cans of film to create more storage space.  Of what film he kept, much has not survived, as it was photographed on original 35mm Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film nitrate film, which deteriorates and becomes inflammable in storage.  Mendelsohns son and a friend, both young animators, discovered the film in Mendelsohns possession in 1947 and rescued what they could.  In some cases, such as The Centaurs, only fragments could be saved.  A negative (photography) negative and incomplete positive was discovered of Performing Animals, a film of animals playing instruments that may have been intended for McCays vaudeville act; it was deemed unsalvageable and destroyed.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=254}}

In 1966, cartoonist Woody Gelman discovered the original artwork for many Little Nemo strips at a cartoon studio where McCays son Robert had worked.  Many of the recovered originals were displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art under the direction of curator A. Hyatt Mayor.  In 1973, Gelman published a collection of Little Nemo strips in Italy.{{sfn Jamieson 2010 p=126}}  His collection of McCay originals is preserved at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum at Ohio State University.{{sfn Spencer 2005}}

McCays work, grounded solidly in his understanding of realistic perspective, presaged the techniques featured in The Walt Disney Company Walt Disneys feature films.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=31}}  Disney paid tribute to McCay in 1955 on an episode of Walt Disney anthology television series Disneyland.  The episode, "The Story of Animated Drawing", gave a history of animation, and dramatized McCays vaudeville act with Gertie.  Robert was invited to the Disney studios as a consultant on the episode, where Disney told him, "Bob, all this should be your fathers".{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=255}}

Animator and McCay biographer John Canemaker produced a film in 1974 called Remembering Winsor McCay, narrated by McCays animation assistant John Fitzsimmons.  Canemaker helped coordinate the first retrospective of McCays films at the third International Animation Film Festival in 1975 in New York, which led to a film show at the Whitney Museum of American Art in winter 1975–76.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=255}}  Canemaker also wrote a biography in 1987 called Winsor McCay: His Life and Art.  In 2005, a revised and expanded version of the biography was released, which comics scholar Jeet Heer called "far and away the most scholarly and intelligent biography ever written about an American cartoonist".{{sfn Heer 2006}}  Animation scholar Paul Wells stated, "McCays influence on the history of animation cannot be understated".{{sfn Wells 2006 p=89}}  Film critic Richard Eder lamented that as an animation pioneer McCay was not able to reach the potential suggested by his work.  Eder compared McCay to the Italian primitives of the early Renaissance, highly skilled "in the limited techniques they could command".{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=199}}  Heer wrote that McCays strength was in his visuals, but that his writing and characters were weak.{{sfn Heer 2006}}

Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini read Little Nemo in the childrens magazine Corriere dei Piccoli Il corriere dei piccoli, and the strip was a "powerful influence" on the filmmaker, according to Fellini biographer Peter Bondanella.{{sfn Bondanella 2002 p=10}}  Comics historian R. C. Harvey has called McCay "the first original genius of the comic strip medium" and in animation.  Harvey said that McCays contemporaries lacked the skill to continue with his innovations, so that they were left for future generations to rediscover and build upon.{{sfn Harvey 1994 p=21}}

McCays work has inspired cartoonists from Carl Barks{{sfn Ault Andrae Gong 2003 p=91}} to Art Spiegelman.{{sfn Jacobowitz 2007 p=164}}  Robert Crumb called McCay a "genius" and one of his favorite cartoonists.  Art Spiegelmans 1974 "Real Dream" strip was partially inspired by Rarebit Fiend,{{sfn Young 2000}} and his In the Shadow of No Towers in 2004 appropriated some of McCays imagery, and included a page of Little Nemo in its appendix.{{sfn Heer 2006}}  Maurice Sendaks childrens book In the Night Kitchen (1970) was an homage to McCays work,{{sfn Nel 2005 p=204}} as was Rick Veitch comic book series Roarin Ricks Rarebit Fiends (1994–96).{{sfn Markstein 2007}}  Kim Deitch and Simon Deitchs graphic novel The Boulevard of Broken Dreams (comics) The Boulevard of Broken Dreams revolved around a character named Winsor Newton,{{efn A pun on Winsor &amp; Newton, whose ink brushes are popular with cartoonists.}} based on an aged McCay.{{sfn Gardner 2012 p=158}}  Cartoonist Berke Breathed lamented that the conditions of newspaper cartooning had devolved to such a degree since McCays time that, had he worked later in the century, he would not have been allotted space sufficient for his expansive full-page fantasies.{{sfn Harvey 1994 p=28}}

As Sigmund Freuds The Interpretation of Dreams first appeared in print in 1899, McCays major dream strips work have invited speculation of a Freudian influence.  A comic strip that appeared in Freuds book, "A French Nurses Dream", strongly resembles the work of McCay in its theme, pacing, Art Nouveau style, and closing panel of the dreamer awakening in bed.  However, the English translation of Freuds book was not published until 1913.{{sfn Shannon 2010 pp=191–193}}

==Work==

===Style===

Virtually from the beginning, McCay innovated with the forms of his chosen media.  He varied the size and shape of comic strip panels for dramatic effect, as in the second instalment of Little Nemo (October 22, 1905), where the panels grow to adapt to a growing forest of mushrooms.{{sfn Harvey 1994 p=21}}  Few of McCays contemporaries were so bold with their page layouts.  Near-contemporary George Herriman with Krazy Kat was the most notable example, but it was not until a generation later that cartoonists such as Frank King (cartoonist) Frank King with Gasoline Alley, Hal Foster  with Prince Valiant, and Roy Crane with Captain Easy attempted such daring designs on their Sunday pages.{{sfn Harvey 1994 pp=21–22}}

McCays detailed hatching{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=48}} mastery of Perspective (graphical) perspective enhanced the illusions in his drawings, particularly in Little Nemo.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=31}}  Fantastic grotesqueries such as what McCay witnessed during his time at the Wonderland and Eden Musee appeared often in McCays work.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=28}}  McCay was noted for the speed and accuracy with which he could draw; crowds of people would gather around to watch him paint billboards.{{sfn Taylor 2005 loc=Introduction}}

File:Rip 1888 Un projet téméraire.jpg thumb alt= Pages from Images Enphantines displayed the same sort of formal playfulness as in McCays work
<br/>
Rip, "Un projet téméraire", 1888

McCay had a taste for the ornate.  The architecture he drew was inspired by that of carnivals, the 1893 Worlds Columbian Exposition in Chicago and the detailed illustrations in British illustrated newspapers The Illustrated London News and The Graphic.  The {{Interlanguage link multi Maison Quantin fr}} of Paris published a series of illustrated books called Images Enphantines, whose pages bear a striking resemblance to McCays early Little Nemo strips, both in their graphic sense and their imaginative layouts.{{sfn Smolderen 2014 p=}}

To Canemaker, McCay had an "absolute precision of line"{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=209}} akin to those of Northern Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer and 19th-century French illustrator Gustave Doré.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 pp=209, 212}}  McCay drew with Higgins black drawing ink, Joseph Gillotts (pens) Gillott {{Numero 290}} pens, Eraser#Art gum erasers art gum, a T-square and Set square angle, and an assortment of Venus Pencils Venus lead pencils.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=127}}  In his early magazine cartoons McCay often painted in gouache.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=55}}

McCay used metafictional techniques such as Self-reference self-referentiality in his work. This was most frequent in Dream of the Rarebit Fiend, where McCay sometimes put himself in the strip, or had characters address the reader.  Sometimes characters become aware of the strip itself—a jealous lover tears the very strip apart in which he appears; another character fastens panel borders to his strip when he realizes the artist has forgotten them;{{sfn Bukatman 2012 p=63}} and in a Sammy Sneeze episode Sammys sneeze destroys the panel borders.{{sfn Harvey 1994 p=25}}

In contrast to the high level of skill in the artwork, the dialogue in McCays speech balloons is crude, sometimes approaching illegibility,{{sfnm 1a1=Gutjahr 1a2=Benton 1y=2001 1p=166 2a1=Heller 2y=2007}} and "disfigur[ing] his otherwise flawless work",{{sfn Harvey 1994 p=28}} according to critic R. C. Harvey.{{sfn Harvey 1994 p=28}}  This is further highlighted by the level of effort and skill apparent in the title lettering.{{sfn Gutjahr Benton 2001 p=166}}  McCay seemed to show little regard for the dialogue balloons, their content, and their placement in the visual composition.  They tended to contain repetitive monologues expressing the increasing distress of the speakers, and showed that McCays gift was in the visual and not the verbal.{{sfn Taylor 2007 p=554}}

In his comics and animation McCay used stock ethnic stereotypes common in his era.{{sfnm 1a1=Shannon 1y=2010 1p=197 2a1=Canemaker 2y=2005 2pp=52–53}}  A conscious attempt to offend is not apparent.{{sfn Shannon 2010 p=200}}  He depicted Black people blacks as savages, or wishing they could be White people white.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 pp=52–53}}  Most prominent were a pair of characters in Little Nemo: the ill-tempered Irishman Flip and the rarely speaking grass-skirted African Little Imp.  In the animated Little Nemo, the Anglo-Saxon Nemo is shown drawn in a dignified Art Nouveau style, and controls by magic the more grotesquely caricatured Flip and Imp.{{sfn Winokur 2012 pp=58, 63}}  Women were few in McCays work, and were depicted as superficial, jealous, and argumentative; the Princess in Little Nemo never partook in the camaraderie the males shared.{{sfn Canemaker 2005 p=46–47}}
