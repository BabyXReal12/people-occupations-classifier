During this time, she acted in films by George Kuchar.
She made her first publishing deal at the age of 21 when her comic book series Meat Cake was picked up by Fantagraphics Books.
She originally considered using the pen name "Richard Dirt" but her father suggested adding a title to her own first name instead, so Darcy used the name Richard Dirt as a character in her comic book.
She performed for a time with Lisa Crystal Carver and Jean-Louis Costess underground cabaret Suckdog Suckdog Circus.

Dame Darcy planned to auction some of Kurt Cobains leftover hair in 2015
but withdrew it following a complaint from Love.
