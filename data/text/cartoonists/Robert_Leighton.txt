Robert Leighton is an American writer and artist, cartoonist, puzzle writer, illustrator, and humorist. He lives and works in New York City. His cartoons have appeared regularly in The New Yorker and other periodicals. In 1996, with Mike Shenk and Amy Goldstein, Leighton co-founded Puzzability, a puzzle-writing company. As part of Puzzability, Leighton has coauthored many books of puzzles, as well as puzzle-oriented Op-Ed pieces for The New York Times.

Asked why he creates cartoons and puzzles, two apparently different kinds of work, Leighton replied: "I think a puzzle is like a cartoon, like a joke, because the puzzle is the setup and the solution is the punch line. A good puzzle keeps you in suspense while you’re working on it, like a cartoon. And the ‘aha!’ is the equivalent of the laugh when a joke is resolved.”<ref name=NorthwesternCP>Northwestern (alumni magazine), A Puzzling Career by Cate Plys, 2006 [http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/spring2006/alumninews/wherearetheynow/banderooge.html] accessed June 13, 2013</ref>

==Puzzle writing==
After Leighton graduated from college, he was interested in the possibility of finding employment as both a humor writer and illustrator, and so he went to work as an editor for Games magazine, which hired him on the basis of his humor writing; at that time he had no experience writing puzzles.<ref>October 24, 2007, New York Times podcast, an interview with Mike Shenk and Robert Leighton (Puzzability had a puzzle on the Op-Ed page that day) [http://podcasts.nytimes.com/podcasts/2007/10/23/24oped.mp3] Accessed June 14, 2013</ref> After leaving Games magazine, he and Mike Shenk and Amy Goldstein, who also had both worked at Games, went on to form a puzzle company called Puzzability.<ref>[http://www.puzzability.com/whatispuz.html Puzzability, "What is Puzzability?"]</ref> As one of the three principals of Puzzability, Leighton has co-authored a number of puzzle books ranging from crosswords to puzzles for children:
