James OBarr is an American graphic artist, best known as the creator of the comic book series The Crow.<ref>{{cite news title= From the Beginning, The Crow Had a Grim Side : Movies: James OBarrs comic book might have adapted smoothly to the big screen, but it was spurred by personal tragedy. work=Los Angeles Times date=1994-05-30 url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-30/entertainment/ca-63961_1_comic-book accessdate=2010-12-04 first=Robert last=Levine}}</ref>

==Early life==
OBarr, an orphan, was raised in the foster care system.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.angelfire.com/zine/darkdreams/crowbirth.html  title=Dark Dreams: How the Crow was Born : James OBarr  accessdate=2008-04-10  deadurl=bot: unknown  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040909202741/http://www.angelfire.com/zine/darkdreams/crowbirth.html  archivedate=September  9, 2004  df= }}</ref>

==Career==
In 1978, OBarr enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Marines. While stationed in Germany, he illustrated combat manuals for the military. 

Before entering the Marines, OBarrs fiancée, Beverly, had been killed by a drunk driver. While living in Berlin in 1981, OBarr began work on his comic The Crow as a means of dealing with his personal tragedy.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.thing.net/~lilyvac/writing35.html  title=DIKE BLAIR &#124; Writing  publisher=Thing.net  date=  accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref> OBarr was further inspired by a Detroit newspaper account of the murder of a young couple over a $20 engagement ring.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.kaos2000.net/interviews/jamesobarr/  title=KAOS2000 Magazine interview with James OBarr / The Crow  publisher=Kaos2000.net  date=2000-07-20  accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref> In The Crow, a man and his fiancée are murdered by a gang of criminals. The man then returns from the dead, guided by a supernatural crow, to hunt their killers.

After his discharge from the Marines, OBarr continued his painting and illustration as well as doing various odd jobs, including working for a Detroit body shop. The Crow sat on a shelf for seven years, but at last he found a publisher with Gary Reed (comic writer) Gary Reed of Caliber Press. The first mini-series was published in 1989. The Crow has since sold more than 750,000 copies worldwide.<ref>[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/conventions/texas/006266510.cfm Wizard magazine] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210001105/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/conventions/texas/006266510.cfm  date=2007-12-10 }} Link inactive 24 April 2008</ref>

OBarrs own hope that his project would result in a personal catharsis went unfulfilled, he told an interviewer in 1994, saying, "[A]s I drew each page, it made me more self-destructive, if anything... There is pure anger on each page".<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.thecrow.info/granovel.htm  title=Graphic novel  publisher=TheCrow.info  date=  accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref> 

In the 1990s OBarr was affiliated with the experimental metal band Trust Obey, which was signed briefly to Trent Reznors Nothing label.{{citation needed date=October 2014}} Trust Obey released the album Fear and Bullets: Music to Accompany The Crow in 1993. The album was packaged with a special edition of The Crow graphic novel.

The Crow was adapted into a successful The Crow (1994 film) film of the same name in 1994, which was marred by the tragic death of its star, Brandon Lee, during filming.<ref>{{cite web url=http://inner_mercy.tripod.com/Accident.html  title=Mercy.Tripod.com  publisher=Inner_mercy.tripod.com  date=  accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref> The film went on to spawn three sequels and a television series.

After the success of The Crow (1994 film) The Crow film, OBarr began planning a post-apocalyptic graphic novel series entitled Gothik. The series was based on The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) The Wizard of Oz and featured "Jonny Z" from his short story "Frame 137" as the main character.<ref>{{cite web  url=http://guitarinternational.com/2011/10/04/interview-with-the-crow-author-artist-musician-james-obarr-let-the-picture-tell-the-story/  title=Interview With "The Crow" Author, Artist, Musician James O’Barr: "Let The Picture Tell The Story"  publisher=Guitar International  date=  accessdate=2011-11-09  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114095911/http://guitarinternational.com/2011/10/04/interview-with-the-crow-author-artist-musician-james-obarr-let-the-picture-tell-the-story/  archivedate=2011-11-14  df= }}</ref>

In 2013, OBarr was named as a consultant on a possible reboot of The Crow film franchise.<ref>[https://variety.com/2013/film/news/james-obarr-boards-the-crow-remake-exclusive-1200504262/ James O’Barr Boards ‘The Crow’ Reboot (EXCLUSIVE)]</ref> Although previously opposed to the project, in an October 2014 interview, OBarr spoke about his involvement in the reboot of The Crow. He discussed the approach to the adaptation and efforts being made to respect the original film.<ref>{{cite web title=Interview with James O’Barr, creator of The Crow url=http://www.korsgaardscommentary.com/2014/10/interview-james-obarr-creator-crow.html website=Korsgaards Commentary}}</ref> Later, in November 2014, OBarr appeared at the Wizard World Tulsa Comic Con and stated that he was co-writing the script with screenwriter Cliff Dorfman.<ref>{{cite web title=James OBarr Talks About Writing Crow Reboot url=http://renegadecinema.com/34684/james-obarr-talks-about-writing-crow-reboot website=Renegade Cinema}}</ref>
