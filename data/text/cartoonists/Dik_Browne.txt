In the 1940s, he worked as an illustrator for Newsweek as well as for an advertising company, where he created the trademark logo for Chiquita Brands International Chiquita.

In 1954, Browne and cartoonist Mort Walker co-created the comic strip Hi and Lois, a Spin-off (media) spin-off of Walkers popular Beetle Bailey strip, featuring Beetles sister, brother-in-law and their family. Walker wrote the strip, which Browne illustrated until his death. The series is now drawn by his son Chance Browne Chance and written by Walkers sons. In 1973, Browne created Hägar the Horrible about an ill-mannered red-bearded medieval viking. The comic is now produced by his son Chris Browne Chris. Both strips have been successful, appearing in hundreds of newspapers for decades.

Browne died of cancer on June 4, 1989, in Sarasota, Florida.<ref>Chris Browne Interview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cKlb2bmOLI</ref>
