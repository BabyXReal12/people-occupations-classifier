In a 1985 Tonight Show appearance, when Johnny Carson asked Michael J. Fox, "When did you really know youd made it in show business?", Fox replied, "When Mort Drucker drew my head."<ref>MADs Greatest Artists: Mort Drucker, 2012, Running Press, pg. 7</ref>

==Early life==
Born in Brooklyn, New York City,<ref name=mort>{{cite web  url=http://www.reuben.org/ncs/members/bios/Drucker.jpg title=Mort Drucker bio publisher=National Cartoonists Society format=JPG accessdate=August 31, 2010}}</ref> Drucker attended Brooklyns Erasmus Hall High School. There he met his future wife Barbara, whom he married shortly after her graduation. The couple moved to Long Island, living in Woodbury, Nassau County, New York Woodbury, where they brought up two daughters, Laurie and Melanie; their family eventually expanded with three grandchildren.<ref name=man>"Man Behind the Drawing Board", The Adventures of Bob Hope 87, 1963.</ref>

==Career==
Drucker entered the comics field by assisting Bert Whitman on the newspaper comic strip Debbie Dean in 1947 when he was 18, based on a recommendation from Will Eisner. He then joined the staff of National Periodical Publications (DC Comics), where he worked as a retoucher. While at DC, Drucker also ghostwriting ghosted "The Mountain Boys," Paul Webbs regular gag panel for Esquire Magazine.<ref name=man/> Early in the 1950s, Drucker left his DC staff gig and began doing full-time freelance work for a number of comic book publishers such as Dell Comics Dell, Atlas Comics (1950s) Atlas and St. John Publications St. Johns, as well as several humor and war titles for his former employer.

===Mad===
In the fall of 1956, shortly after the departure of Mads founding editor Harvey Kurtzman, Drucker found his way to Mad. His first visit to the magazines offices coincided with a World Series broadcast, and publisher Bill Gaines told Drucker that if the Brooklyn Dodgers won the game, he would be given a drawing assignment. The Dodgers did win. Capricious though Druckers alleged audition process may have been, it made for a good anecdote. Years later, Gaines unsurprisingly confessed, "We would have hired him anyway."

By the time he wound down his Mad career 55 years later, Drucker held the longest uninterrupted tenure of any Mad artist.  Drucker has the most bylined articles by any Mad artist who does not also write his own material, with more than 400.

Drucker had arrived at the Mad offices with pages from his Hopalong Cassidy comic book work for DC Comics and some of his "Mountain Boys" strips, as well as a humorous "little situation" featuring The Lone Ranger and Tonto that he had specifically drawn for the interview.  Though this work was unlike the likenesses and continuities he would become best known for, the Mad staff reacted favorably.  The first to review Druckers portfolio was Mad associate editor Nick Meglin, who admitted, "I didnt spot how great he was at caricatures.  Not at first.  But then, he wasnt that great then."  Drucker himself says that he "just wanted to be an artist... to get paid for drawing anything," and only started focusing on caricature work because he started getting more and more of those assignments.  "Thats when I realized Id found my calling," said Drucker.<ref>Evanier, Mark, MAD Art, Watson-Guptill Publications, 2002</ref> At the time of Druckers arrival, Mad did not regularly feature TV and movie satires; editor Al Feldstein credited Druckers style and ability for the decision to start featuring them in every issue.

Meglin called Drucker "number one in a field of one."  Charles Schulz wrote, "Frankly, I dont know how he does it, and I stand in a long list of admirers... I think he draws everything the way we would all like to draw."  In 2012, referring to Druckers splash page for Mads parody of The Godfather, the Comics Reporters Tom Spurgeon wrote, "The way he draws James Caans eyebrow is worth some folks entire careers."<ref>{{cite web  url=http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/bundled_tossed_untied_and_stacked052212/  title=Bundled, Tossed, Untied And Stacked  first=Tom  last=Spurgeon  date=May 22, 2012  website=The Comics Reporter  publisher=Tom Spurgeon  accessdate=April 23, 2015}}</ref>

In 2012, Drucker discussed his art style, and how he applied it to his Mad assignments:

<blockquote>Ive always considered a caricature to be the complete person, not just a likeness.  Hands in particular have always been a prime focus for me as they can be as expressive of character as the exaggerations and distortions a caricaturist searches for.  I try to capture the essence of the person, not just facial features... Ive discovered through years of working at capturing a humorous likeness that its not about the features themselves as much as the space between the features.  We all have two eyes, a nose, a mouth, hair and jaw lines, but yet we all look different.  What makes that so is the space between them.

The artist is actually creating his own storyboard for the film.  I become the "camera" and look for angles, lighting, close-ups, wide angles, long shots-- just as a director does to tell the story in the most visually interesting way he can.  My first sketches are as much composition and design ideas as they are character and action images... I dont want to get too involved in the juicy parts since some of what Im doing will be modified or discarded as I get further involved in the storytelling.  I then stand back and look at the page as a complete unit to make sure its designed well: "Hmmm, three close-up panels in a row of characters talking.  Better change that middle panel to a far shot.  Maybe make that panel an open vignette."  ...Then I place the facing pages together and look at how the spread holds together, and sometimes make changes based on that.<ref>MADs Greatest Artists: Mort Drucker, 2012, Running Press, pg. 13</ref></blockquote>

===Other work===
Drucker also remained active for DC, illustrating War Stories, among other titles. Beginning in 1959, he spent four years drawing DCs The Adventures of Bob Hope comic book.<ref name=man/>  Drucker credits this stint as a key moment in his career, because it focused his work on caricature.<ref>MADs Greatest Artists: Mort Drucker, 2012, Running Press, pg. 12</ref>

In 1962, Drucker teamed with the prolific humor writer Paul Laikin on the highly successful JFK Coloring Book (Kanrom Publishers), which sold 2,500,000 copies.  Two decades later, Drucker illustrated similar coloring books on Ollie North and Ronald Reagan.<ref name=man/><ref>Pacific Stars and Stripes, August 24, 1987.</ref> His film posters include Universal Studios Universals American Graffiti (1973), directed by George Lucas<ref name=mort/> with Drucker also drawing the high school yearbook pictures in the film trailer.

His album covers include art for the pop band The Bears (band) The Bears<ref>http://www.adrianbelew.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58&Itemid=64</ref> and the Anthrax (American band) Anthrax album State of Euphoria, as well as humor albums in the vein of his own "JFK Coloring Book" including "The LBJ Menagerie" and "The New First Family, 1968."  In addition to books collecting his own work, he has provided illustrations for numerous books by others, including childrens literature childrens books, humor books and satire. He drew the prop cartoons used in the 1957 Broadway musical comedy, Rumple, starring Gretchen Wyler, Elliott Gould and Eddie Foy, Jr.<ref name=man/>

Between 1984 and 1987, Drucker collaborated with Jerry Dumas (and John Reiner) on the daily comic strip Benchley. Set in the White House, the plot revolved around the fictive character Benchley who acted as the assistant and admirer of contemporary president Ronald Reagan. Dumas commented, "Nobody ever did a strip about the government. Its a wonderful place to set a strip. Theres so much room for humor in the White House."<ref>"Comic strip set in White House", Lethbridge Herald (Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada Alberta, Canada), July 5, 1984.</ref> Benchley was syndicated by the Register and Tribune Syndicate.<ref name="(editor)">{{cite book author=Gary Dowell, Greg Holman, Don Mangus, James L.
