After drawing such features as Insect Life, McBrides Cartoon (1927), and Clifford McBrides Pantomime Comic (1932), he created Elby, a character based on his uncle, Henry Elba Eastman. He soon began to add situations involving Elbys dog, Napoleon.
Drawing for a minor syndicate, LaFave Newspaper Features, McBride began Napoleon as a daily strip on June 6, 1932, adding a Sunday strip in 1933. The following year the title was changed to Napoleon and Uncle Elby.
