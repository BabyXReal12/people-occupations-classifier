After drawing such features as Insect Life, McBrides Cartoon (1927), and Clifford McBrides Pantomime Comic (1932), he created Elby, a character based on his uncle, Henry Elba Eastman. He soon began to add situations involving Elbys dog, Napoleon.<ref name=toon>[http://www.toonopedia.com/napoleon.htm Markstein, Don. Toonopedia: Napoleon and Uncle Elby]</ref>

The following year the title was changed to Napoleon and Uncle Elby.<ref name=toon/> McBrides cartoons appeared in such magazines as Life (magazine) Life and Cosmopolitan, and he profited from hardcover reprints, comic books and the licensing of his character as a spokesdog during the 1940s for Red Heart Dog Food.<ref name=toon/> Merchandising included a stuffed toy of Napoleon.

McBrides assistant on the strip was Roger Armstrong (1917â€“2007). After McBrides 1951 death in Altadena, California, his second wife, Margot Fischer McBride, wrote the strip, and she hired Armstrong as the illustrator. In 1952, the team switched to the Mirror Enterprises Syndicate in Los Angeles, keeping the strip going for the next eight years.<ref name=lam/><ref>[http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2008_08_01_archive.html Knoll, Erwin.

Although Napoleon was an Irish Wolfhound, McBrides own dog was Ace, a 190-pound St. Bernard (dog) St. Bernard. Ace was sometimes used for promotional purposes with McBride, including two short films, Unusual Occupations (1941) and Artists Antics (1946).
