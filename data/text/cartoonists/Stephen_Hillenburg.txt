It has gone on to become one of the List of longest-running United States television series longest-running American television series as well as the highest-rated show ever to air on Nickelodeon.

Born in Lawton, Oklahoma and raised in Anaheim, California, Hillenburg became fascinated with the ocean as a child and developed an interest in art. He started his professional career in 1984, instructing marine biology, at the Ocean Institute Orange County Marine Institute, where he wrote The Intertidal Zone, an informative comic book about tide pool tide-pool animals, which he used to educate his students. In 1989, two years after leaving teaching, Hillenburg enrolled at the California Institute of the Arts to pursue a career in animation. He was later offered a job on the Nickelodeon animated television series Rockos Modern Life (1993{{ndash}}1996) after his success with short films The Green Beret and Wormholes (both 1992), which he made while studying animation.

In 1994, Hillenburg began developing The Intertidal Zone characters and concepts for what became SpongeBob SquarePants. The show premiered in 1999 and has aired since then. He also directed The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004), which he originally intended to be the series finale. However, Nickelodeon wanted to produce more episodes, so Hillenburg resigned as the showrunner. He went back to making short films, with Hollywood Blvd., USA (2013). In 2015, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water premiered; the sequel to the 2004 film, it marked Hillenburgs return to the show, after he co-wrote the story.

Besides his two Emmy Awards and six Annie Awards for SpongeBob SquarePants, Hillenburg has also received other recognition, such as an accolade from Heal the Bay for his efforts on elevating marine life awareness, and the National Cartoonists Society Division Awards#Television Animation Award Television Animation Award from the National Cartoonists Society.

Hillenburg has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2017, but stated he would continue to work on his show.

Hillenburg explained that "anything goes" in experimental animation. Although this allowed him to explore alternatives to conventional methods of filmmaking, he still ventured to employ his own style, which he called "an industry style"; he preferred to traditional animation traditionally animate his films (where each Film frame frame is drawn by hand) rather than, for instance, make cartoons "out of sand by filming piles of sand changing".<ref name="Big Pop Fun"/> Hillenburg has at least one other short film that he made as an animation student but its title is unspecified.<ref name="WP Interview"/><ref name="Makin Toons"/>

===SpongeBob SquarePants===
{{Main article SpongeBob SquarePants}}

====Creation====
Some evidence shows that the idea for SpongeBob SquarePants dates back to 1986, during Hillenburgs time at the Orange County Marine Institute.<ref name="HeintjesHA"/> He indicated that childrens television series such as Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse (1987{{ndash}}1988) and Pee-wees Playhouse (1986{{ndash}}1991) "sparked something in [him]." He continued, "I dont know if this is true for everybody else, but it always seems like, for me, Ill start thinking about something and it takes about ten years to actually have it happen, or have someone else believe in it... It took me a few years to get [SpongeBob SquarePants] together."<ref name="Makin Toons"/>

During the production of Rockos Modern Life, Martin Olson, one of the writers, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, he had not even considered creating his own series:<ref name="Big Pop Fun"/> "After watching Joe [Murray] tear his hair out a lot, dealing with all the problems that came up, I thought I would never want to produce a show of my own."<ref name="Abbey, p. 124"/> However, he realized that if he ever did, this would be the best approach:<ref name="Big Pop Fun"/><ref name="Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants"/><ref name="Banks, p. 10">{{harvnb Banks 2004 p=10}}</ref> "For all those years it seemed like I was doing these two totally separate things. I wondered what it all meant. I didnt see a synthesis. It was great when [my two interests] all came together in [a show]. I felt relieved that I hadnt wasted a lot of time doing something that I then abandoned to do something else. It has been pretty rewarding," Hillenburg said in 2002.<ref name="Current Biography"/> He claimed that he finally decided to create a series as he was driving to the beach on the Interstate 10 in California#Santa Monica Freeway Santa Monica Freeway one day.<ref name="Abbey, p. 124"/>

As he was developing the shows concept, Hillenburg remembered his teaching experience at the Orange County Marine Institute and how mesmerized children were by tide-pool animals, including crabs, octopuses, starfish, and sponges.<ref name="Lenburg, p. 140"/><ref name="Current Biography"/><ref name="Abbey, p. 124"/> It came to him that the series should take place underwater, with a focus on those creatures: "I wanted to create a small town underwater where the characters were more like us than like fish. They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays."<ref name="Abbey, p. 124"/> It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, "something that was fantastic but believable."<ref name="Abbey, p. 124"/> He also wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time exemplified by Buddy film buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show (1991{{ndash}}1995). As a result, he decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge:<ref name="Big Pop Fun"/> "I wanted to do a show about a character that was an innocent, and so I focused on a sea sponge because its a funny animal, a strange one."<ref name="For young viewers"/> In 1994,<ref name="WalkervViacom"/> Hillenburg began to further develop some characters from The Intertidal Zone,<ref name="Big Pop Fun"/><ref name="WalkervViacom"/> including Bob the Sponge.<ref name="Big Pop Fun"/>

Bob the Sponge is the comics "announcer".<ref name="Big Pop Fun"/> He resembles an actual sea sponge, and at first Hillenburg continued this design<ref name="Big Pop Fun"/><ref name="Makin Toons">{{harvnb Neuwirth 2003 pp=50–51}}</ref><ref name="Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants"/><ref name="Banks, p.31">{{harvnb Banks 2004 p=31}}</ref> because it "was the correct thing to do biologically as a marine-science teacher."<ref name="Abbey, p. 124"/> In determining the new characters personality, he drew inspiration from innocent, childlike figures that he enjoyed, such as Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Jerry Lewis, and Pee-wee Herman.<ref name="HeintjesHA">{{Cite journal last=Heintjes first=Tom url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/ title=The Oral History of SpongeBob SquarePants magazine=Hogans Alley issue=17 publisher=Bull Moose Publishing accessdate=August 28, 2015 date=September 21, 2012 deadurl=no archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831044034/http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/ archivedate=August 31, 2015 df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Big Pop Fun"/><ref name="Makin Toons"/><ref name="Banks pg. 30">{{harvnb Banks 2004 p=30}}</ref> He then considered modeling the character after a Sponge (material) kitchen sponge, and realized that this idea would match the characters square personality perfectly:<ref name="Big Pop Fun"/><ref name="Makin Toons"/><ref name="Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants"/> "[I]t looked so funny.

In 1997, while Pitch (filmmaking) pitching the cartoon to executives at Nickelodeon, Hillenburg donned a Hawaiian shirt, brought along an "underwater Vivarium terrarium with models of the characters", and played Hawaiian music to set the theme. Nickelodeon executive Eric Coleman (producer) Eric Coleman described the setup  as "pretty amazing".<ref name="Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants"/> Although Derek Drymon, creative director of SpongeBob SquarePants, described the pitch as stressful, he said it went "very well".<ref name="Origin of SpongeBob SquarePants"/> Nickelodeon approved and gave Hillenburg money to produce the show.<ref name="Abbey, p. 128">{{harvnb Abbey 2004 p=128}}</ref>
