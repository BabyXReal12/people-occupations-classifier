Stephen McDannell Hillenburg
(born August{{nbsp}}21, 1961) is an American cartoonist, animator, and former List of marine biologists marine biologist. He is the creator of the Nickelodeon television series SpongeBob SquarePants (1999{{ndash}}), which he has also directed, produced, and written. It has gone on to become one of the List of longest-running United States television series longest-running American television series as well as the highest-rated show ever to air on Nickelodeon.

Born in Lawton, Oklahoma and raised in Anaheim, California, Hillenburg became fascinated with the ocean as a child and developed an interest in art. He started his professional career in 1984, instructing marine biology, at the Ocean Institute Orange County Marine Institute, where he wrote The Intertidal Zone, an informative comic book about tide pool tide-pool animals, which he used to educate his students. In 1989, two years after leaving teaching, Hillenburg enrolled at the California Institute of the Arts to pursue a career in animation. He was later offered a job on the Nickelodeon animated television series Rockos Modern Life (1993{{ndash}}1996) after his success with short films The Green Beret and Wormholes (both 1992), which he made while studying animation.

In 1994, Hillenburg began developing The Intertidal Zone characters and concepts for what became SpongeBob SquarePants. The show premiered in 1999 and has aired since then. He also directed The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004), which he originally intended to be the series finale. However, Nickelodeon wanted to produce more episodes, so Hillenburg resigned as the showrunner. He went back to making short films, with Hollywood Blvd., USA (2013). In 2015, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water premiered; the sequel to the 2004 film, it marked Hillenburgs return to the show, after he co-wrote the story.

Besides his two Emmy Awards and six Annie Awards for SpongeBob SquarePants, Hillenburg has also received other recognition, such as an accolade from Heal the Bay for his efforts on elevating marine life awareness, and the National Cartoonists Society Division Awards#Television Animation Award Television Animation Award from the National Cartoonists Society. Despite this, he has been involved in public controversies, including one that centered on speculation over the SpongeBob SquarePants (character) SpongeBob characters intended sexual orientation, and a lawsuit that was filed against him. Hillenburg has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2017, but stated he would continue to work on his show.

==Early life and education==
Stephen Hillenburg was born on August{{nbsp}}21, 1961, at Fort Sill,
a United States Army post in Lawton, Oklahoma, where his father, Kelly{{nbsp}}N. Hillenburg{{nbsp}}Jr. (July{{nbsp}}16, 1936{{nbsp}}{{ndash}} August{{nbsp}}30, 2006),
worked for the U.S. military.
His mother, Nancy (née Dufour),
taught visually-impaired students.
When he was a year old,
the family moved to Orange County, California
where his father began a career as a draftsman and designer in the aerospace industry.
His younger brother, Bryan,
eventually became a draftsman/designer as well.
Hillenburg has no recollection of life in Oklahoma,
only of growing up in Anaheim, California.
When an interviewer asked him to describe himself as a child, he replied that he was "probably well-meaning and naive like all kids."
His passion for sea life can be traced to his childhood, when films by French Oceanography oceanographer Jacques Cousteau made a strong impression on him.
Hillenburg has said that Cousteau "provided a view into that world", which he had not known existed.
He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that "should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad."
Hillenburg also developed his interest in art at a young age.
His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration that he drew in third grade, depicting "a bunch of army men{{nbsp}}... kissing and hugging instead of fighting", brought him the first praise for his artwork, when his teacher commended it.
"Of course, this is 1970{{nbsp}}... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that was in the middle of [the Vietnam War
. She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...{{nbsp}}I had no idea about the implications, really, because I just thought it was a funny idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, oh my gosh, look at that", Hillenburg elaborated.
It was then he knew he "had some [creative] skill".
He asserts that his artistry came from his mothers side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was "really, really gifted" and a "great painter".
In the 1970s, someone took Hillenburg to the International Tournée of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He was "knocked out" by the foreign animated films, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen (animator) Paul Driessens The Killing of an Egg (1977). "That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on," he recounted.

Ive always done both. I just kind of figured that the marine biology would be a career and the art would be something I did for my own self-expression."

He attended Savanna High School in Anaheim,
describing himself as a "band geek" who played the trumpet.
At age 15, he snorkeling snorkeled for the first time;
Hillenburg took part in a "dive program"
at Woods Coves
in Laguna Beach, California,
as part of the California Association of Regional Occupational Centers and Programs Regional Occupational Program at Savanna.
This experience, as well as subsequent dives,
reinforced his interest in, and led to his decision to study, marine biology in college:
"The switch clicked and I decided I wanted to be a marine biologist, but I also liked being an artist."
Some of his high-school teachers, who knew of his interest in art and fascination with the ocean, advised him otherwise,
saying: "You should just draw fish."
However, the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him and he was more riveted by "making weird, little paintings".
During a few summers after finishing high school, he worked as a fry cook and lobster boiler
at a fast-food seafood restaurant
in Maine.
(This later inspired SpongeBob SquarePants (character) SpongeBob SquarePants occupation in the SpongeBob SquarePants television series, which he would begin developing in 1994.
)

Hillenburg went to Humboldt State University in Arcata, California as a marine-science major.
He minored in art,
and claims that "[he] blossomed as a painter in Humboldt."
In 1984, he earned his bachelors degree in natural-resource planning and interpretation, with an emphasis on marine resources.
He intended to take a masters degree, but said it would be in art:
"Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But by the time I got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art."
==Early career==
File:Ocean Institute, aerial shot, cropped.png thumb 200px left Hillenburg taught marine biology to visitors of the Orange County Marine Institute (pictured) in Dana Point, California during the mid-1980s.
After graduating from college, Hillenburg held various jobs in 1984, including as a park service attendant in Utah and an art director in San Francisco, before landing the job he wanted: teaching children.
He hoped to work in a national park on the coast,
and eventually found a job at the Ocean Institute Orange County Marine Institute (now known as the Ocean Institute),
an organization in Dana Point, California dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history.
Hillenburg was a marine-biology teacher there for three years:
"We taught tide pool tide-pool ecology, nautical history, biodiversity diversity and Aquatic adaptation adaptation. Working there, I saw how enamored kids are with undersea life, especially with tide-pool creatures."
He stayed at the Dana Point Marina
and was also a staff artist.
Although "[i]t was a great experience" for him,
during this period, Hillenburg realized he was more interested in art than his chosen profession.
While working there one of the educational directors asked him if he would be interested in creating an educational comic book about the Tide pool#Life in the tide pool animal life of tidal pools.
He created a comic called The Intertidal Zone, which he used to teach his students.
It featured anthropomorphic forms of sea life, many of which would evolve into List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters SpongeBob SquarePants characters
—including "Bob the Sponge", the comics co-host, who resembled an actual sponge sea sponge, as opposed to his later SpongeBob SquarePants character, who resembles a Sponge (material) kitchen sponge.
He tried to get the comic published, but the publishers he approached turned him down.
At one point during his tenure with the Orange County Marine Institute, Hillenburg started going to film festival animation festivals such as the International Tournée of Animation and Spike and Mikes Festival of Animation where films made by California Institute of the Arts (colloquially called CalArts) students were shown.
He determined that he wanted to pursue a career in that field.
Hillenburg had planned to take a masters degree in art, but instead of "going back to school for painting",
he left his job in 1987 to become an animator.
In 1989,
Hillenburg enrolled in the Experimental Animation Program at CalArts.
About this decision, he said: "Changing careers like that is scary, but the irony is that animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education is more of a struggle."
He studied under Jules Engel,
the founding director of the program,
