==Biography==

===Early career===

Doucet was born in Montreal, Quebec.  She was educated first at an all-girls Catholic school, then studied fine arts at Cégep du Vieux Montréal (a junior college) and afterwards at the Université du Québec à Montréal.<ref name=autobio /> Her university degree was in printmaking printing arts.<ref name=autobio />  She began cartooning in 1987. She was published in small-press comics and self-published her own comic called Dirty Plotte.  She used the photocopied zine to record "her day to day life, her dreams, angsts, [and] fantasies."<ref name=autobio />  It was only when she was published in Weirdo (magazine) Weirdo,<ref name=weirdo26>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=46772 Weirdo #26 at the GCD]</ref> Robert Crumbs magazine, that she began to attract critical attention.<ref name=onset>Mark Shainblum Shainblum, Mark: "Canadas Alternative Comic Creators Stand Up For Themselves", Onset, volume 1 issue 4 (page25)</ref>

===Comic works===

Doucet began being published by Drawn & Quarterly in January 1991 in a regular sized comic series also named Dirty Plotte.<ref name=plottegcd>[http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=13917 Dirty Plotte (Drawn & Quarterly) at the GCD]</ref>  Shortly thereafter, she moved to New York City New York. Although she moved to Seattle, Washington Seattle the following year, her experiences in New York formed the basis of the critically acclaimed My New York Diary (many stories of which were taken from Dirty Plotte). She moved from Seattle to Berlin in 1995, before finally returning to Montreal in 1998.<ref name=autobio />  While in Berlin, she had a book named Ciboire de criss published by LAssociation in Paris, her first book in French.<ref name=autobio /> Once back in Montreal, she released the twelfth and final issue of Dirty Plotte before beginning a brief hiatus from comics.

She returned to the field in 2000 with The Madame Paul Affair, a slice-of-life look at contemporary Montreal which was originally serialized in ici (magazine) Ici-Montreal, a local alternative weekly. At the same time, she was branching out into more experimental territory, culminating with the 2001 release of Long Time Relationship, a collection of prints and engravings. In 2004, Doucet also published in French an illustrated diary (Journal) chronicling about a year of her life and, in 2006, an autobiography made from a collage of words cut from magazines and newspapers (J comme Je).  Also in spring of 2006 she had her first solo print show, named en souvenir du Melek, at the galerie B-312 in Montreal.<ref name=b312>[http://www.galerieb-312.qc.ca/html/expo_jdoucet.html Art show introduction at galerie B-312 by Jean-Emile Verdier] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706200516/http://www.galerieb-312.qc.ca/html/expo_jdoucet.html  date=2011-07-06 }}</ref> In December 2007, Drawn & Quarterly published 365 Days: A Diary by Julie Doucet, in which she chronicled her life for a year, starting in late 2002.<ref>{{Cite web  publisher=Pop Matters  url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/365-days-a-diary-by-julie-doucet/  title=365 Days: A Diary by Julie Doucet  first=Brian  last=Bethel  date=25 March 2008  accessdate=30 November 2010 }}</ref>

===Post-comic works===

She remains a fixture in the Montreal arts community, but in an interview in the June 22, 2006, edition of the Montreal Mirror, she declared that she had retired from long-form comics.<ref name=mirror>[http://www.montrealmirror.com/2006/062206/cover_art.html Interview in the Montreal Mirror, June 22, 2006] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080810223933/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2006/062206/cover_art.html  date=August 10, 2008 }}</ref>

She also said "...its quite a lot of work, and not that much money. I went to a newspaper to propose a comic strip because I only had to draw a small page and it would be out the next week. For once it was regular pay and good money."<ref name=mirror />

{{cquote I quit comics because I got completely sick of it. I was drawing comics all the time and didnt have the time or energy to do anything else. That got to me in the end. I never made enough money from comics to be able to take a break and do something else. Now I just cant stand comics.<ref name=drama>"A Good Life: The Julie Doucet Interview" by Dan Nadel, published in The Drama, issue no. 7 (2006)</ref>}}

{{cquote . . . I wish my work would be recognized by a larger crowd of people as more art than be stuck with the cartoonist label for the rest of my life. Thats whats killing me about a lot of those comics guys. Dan Clowes is mostly a writer, a great artist, and has tried different things, But a lot of those guys, their drawing style never changes—the content neither—and it seems it never will. I just dont understand that, how you can spend fifty years of your artist life doing the same thing over and over again.<ref name=drama />}}

She had a book of poetry published by L’Oie de Cravan in 2006, À l’école de l’amour.<ref name=walrus>[http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2008.02-online-exclusive-julie-doucet-interview Interview with Doucet at The Walrus magazine] {{webarchive url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513053835/http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2008.02-online-exclusive-julie-doucet-interview/  date=2008-05-13 }}</ref> Her current artwork consists of linocuts, collage and papier-mache sculptures.<ref name=dandqbio>[http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/artBio.php?artist=a3dff7dd52e65a Biography at Drawn and Quarterly]</ref> In 2007, Doucet designed the cover for the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition of Louisa May Alcotts Little Women.<ref name=penguin>[http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780143105015,00.html?strSrchSql=doucet/Little_Women_Louisa_May_Alcott# Little Women at Penguin]</ref>
