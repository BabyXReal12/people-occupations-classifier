Steadman had a long partnership with the American journalist Hunter S. Thompson, drawing pictures for several of his articles and books.
He accompanied Thompson to the Kentucky Derby The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved for an article for the magazine Scanlans Monthly Scanlans, to the Honolulu Marathon The Curse of Lono for the magazine Running, and illustrated both Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail 72. 

Steadman has expressed regret at selling the original illustrations for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas at the advice of his agent to Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner for the sum of $75, a fraction of their significant value. As a result of that transaction Steadman has largely refused to sell any of his original artwork and has been quoted as saying "If anyone owns a Steadman original, its stolen." While there are original pieces held outside of his archive, they are exceedingly rare. The artist has kept possession of the vast bulk of his original artwork.

Steadman appears on the second disc of The Criterion Collection Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film) Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas DVD set, in a documentary called Fear and Loathing on the Road to Hollywood Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision, which was made by the BBC in 1978, of Thompson planning the tower and cannon that his ashes were later blasted out of. The cannon was atop a 153-ft. tower of Thompsons fist gripping a peyote button; Thompson demands that Steadman gives the fist two thumbs, "Right now."

As well as writing and illustrating his own books and Thompsons, Steadman has worked with writers including Ted Hughes, Adrian Mitchell and Brian Patten, and also illustrated editions of Alices Adventures in Wonderland Alice in Wonderland, Treasure Island, Animal Farm, the English translation of Flann OBriens Gaelic-language classic The Poor Mouth, and most recently, Fahrenheit 451.

Among the British public, Steadman is well known for his illustrations for the catalogues of the off-licence chain Oddbins and he designed a set of four British postage stamps to commemorate the appearance of Halleys Comet in 1985. He also designed the labels for Flying Dog Brewery Flying Dog beer and Cardinal "Spiced" Zin wine, which was banned in Ohio for Steadmans "disturbing" interpretation of a Catholic cardinal on its label{{citation needed date=May 2015}}.

Steadman also illustrated Will Selfs column in The Independent newspaper. Hal Willner and Johnny Depps anthology of songs, Rogues Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys (2006) contains two contributions from Steadman; he sings lead on "Little Boy Billee", and sings backing vocals on Eliza Carthys song "Rolling Sea".

He has also drawn covers for numerous music artists, including the Who, Exodus (American band) Exodus, Frank Zappa and Ambrosia (band) Ambrosia,
and the lead banner for the gonzo journalism website GonzoToday.com.
In 2011, Steadman began running prose and poetry in Kotori Magazine.
He also contributed to the BirdLife Internationals Preventing Extinctions programme with an image of critically endangered northern bald ibis.
In 2017 Steadman penned the artwork for Travis Scott and Quavos joint project Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho.
Steadman is a member of the Chelsea Arts Club.
