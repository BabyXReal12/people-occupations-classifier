In 1888, he moved to Berlin and studied at the Prussian Academy of Sciences Königliche Akademie Berlin under Ernst Hancke. He continued his studies at art schools in Berlin with Karl Schlabitz, and in Paris with sculptor Filippo Colarossi. He started as a caricaturist for several magazines including Harpers Round Table, Harpers Young People, Humoristische Blätter, Lustige Blätter, Das Narrenschiff (magazine) Das Narrenschiff, Berliner Tageblatt and Ulk.

In 1900, he met Clara Fürst, daughter of the painter Gustav Fürst. He married her in 1901, and they had two daughters. In 1905, he separated from his wife after meeting Julia Berg. He married Berg in 1908 and the couple had three boys.

The artist was represented with drawings at the exhibitions of the annual Berlin Secession in the years 1901 through 1903.

Feiningers career as cartoonist started in 1894. He was working for several German, French and American magazines. In February 1906, when a quarter of Chicagos population was of German descent, James Keeley, editor of The Chicago Tribune traveled to Germany to procure the services of the most popular humor artists. He recruited Feininger to illustrate two comic strips "The Kin-der-Kids" and "Wee Willie Winkies World" for the Chicago Tribune.<ref name=aaabio/><ref name=osu>{{cite web url=http://cartoons.osu.edu/digital_albums/lyonelfeininger/feininger.html title=Lyonel Feininger work=Cartoons publisher=Ohio State University accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref> The strips were noted for their wikt:fey fey humor and graphic experimentation. He also worked as a commercial caricaturist for 20 years for various newspapers and magazines in both the United States and Germany. Later, Art Spiegelman wrote in The New York Times Book Review, that Feiningers comics have “achieved a breathtaking formal grace unsurpassed in the history of the medium.”<ref name=osu/>

Feininger started working as a fine artist at the age of 36. He was a member of the Berliner Sezession in 1909, and he was associated with German expressionist groups: Die Brücke, the Novembergruppe, Gruppe 1919, the Blaue Reiter circle and Die Blaue Vier (The Blue Four). His first solo exhibit was at Sturm Gallery in Berlin, 1917.<ref name="test" /> When Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus in Germany in 1919, Feininger was his first faculty appointment, and became the master artist in charge of the printmaking workshop.<ref name=aaabio/><ref name="test">Muir, Laura and Nathan Timpano.

From 1909 until 1921, Feininger spent summer vacations on the island of Usedom to recover and to get new inspiration.<ref>[http://www.papileo.de/ www.papileo.de]</ref> He continued to create paintings and drawings of Benz (Usedom) Benz for the rest of his life, even after returning to live in the United States. A tour of the sites appearing in the works of Feininger follows a path with markers in the ground to guide visitors.

He designed the cover for the Bauhaus 1919 manifesto: an expressionist woodcut cathedral. He taught at the Bauhaus for several years. Among the students who attended his workshops were Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack (German/Australian (1893–1965), Hans Friedrich Grohs (German 1892 - 1981), and Margarete Koehler-Bittkow (German/American, 1898–1964).

When the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, the situation became unbearable for Feininger and his wife. The Nazi Party declared his work to be "degenerate."<ref name=aaabio/> They moved to America after his work was exhibited in the degenerate art (Entartete Kunst) in 1936, but before the 1937 exhibition in Munich. He taught at Mills College before returning to New York.<ref name=aaabio /> He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1955.<ref name=AAAL>{{cite web title=Deceased Members  url=http://www.artsandletters.org/academicians2_deceased.php  work=American Academy of Arts and Letters  accessdate=July 30, 2011  deadurl=yes  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726004624/http://www.artsandletters.org/academicians2_deceased.php  archivedate=July 26, 2011  df= }}</ref>

In addition to drawing, Feininger created art with painted toy figures being photographed in front of drawn backgrounds.<ref>{{cite book pages=36–76 title=Lyonel Feininger: City at the Edge of the World first=T. Lux last=Feininger publisher=Frederick A. Praeger year=1965 lccn=65-25280}}</ref>

Feininger produced a large body of photographic works between 1928 and the mid-1950s. He kept his photographic work within his circle of friends, and it was not shared with the public in his lifetime. He gave some prints away to his colleagues Walter Gropius and Alfred H. Barr, Jr..<ref name="test" />

Feininger also had intermittent activity as a pianist and composer, with several piano compositions and fugues for organ extant.

His sons, Andreas Feininger and T. Lux Feininger, both became noted artists, the former as a photographer and the latter as a photographer and painter. T. Lux Feininger died July 7, 2011 at the age of 101.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/arts/t-lux-feininger-photographer-and-painter-dies-at-101.html NY Times Obituary]</ref>

==Major retrospective==

A major retrospective exhibition of Lyonel Feiningers work, initially at the Whitney Museum of American Art during June 30 October 16, 2011, was subsequently due to run at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts during January 20–May 13, 2012. The exhibition is described as "the first in Feininger’s native country in more than forty-five years, and the first ever to include the full breadth of his art" and as "accompanied by a richly illustrated monograph with a feature essay that provides a broad overview of Feininger’s career..."<ref>"Lyonel Feininger at the Edge of the World". Whitney Museum of American Art. Accessed on October 6, 2011 at: http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/LyonelFeininger.</ref> Many critics have argued that the artists work was at its most mature around 1910 in works in which the power of Feininger as illustrator balance his abstract side; however, we have to consider the possibility that Feininger used cubism as a more artistically succinct tool to establish his version of the concept known as the objective correlative. In tandem with the Whitney retrospective, the American Symphony Orchestra under Leon Botstein, at Carnegie Hall on 21 October 2011, performed three orchestral fugues written by Feininger. Barbara Haskell, curator of the Whitney exhibit, wrote that for his entire life, Feininger credited Bach with having been his “master in painting.” <ref> http://americansymphony.org/lyonel-feininger/ </ref>
