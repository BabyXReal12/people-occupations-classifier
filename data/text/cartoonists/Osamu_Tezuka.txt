{{nihongo  Osamu Tezuka 手塚 治虫, {{lang en born}} 手塚 治 Tezuka Osamu   {{birth date 1928 11 3 df = y}} – 9 February 1989 lead=yes}} was a Japanese manga artist, cartoonist, animator, and film producer. Born in Osaka Prefecture, his prolific output, pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as "the father of manga", "the godfather of manga" and "the god of manga." Additionally, he is often considered the Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney, who served as a major inspiration during Tezukas formative years.<ref>{{Citation   title = Tezuka Osamu Monogatari   year = 1992   publisher = Tezuka Productions}}.</ref>

Tezuka began what was known as the manga revolution in Japan with his Shin Takarajima New Treasure Island published in 1947. His legendary output would spawn some of the most influential, successful, and well received manga series including Astro Boy, Kimba the White Lion, Black Jack (manga) Black Jack, and Phoenix (manga) Phoenix, all of which won several awards.

Tezuka died of stomach cancer in 1989. His death had an immediate impact on the Japanese public and other cartoonists. A museum was constructed in Takarazuka, Hyōgo Takarazuka dedicated to his memory and life works, and Tezuka received many posthumous awards. Several animations were in production at the time of his death along with the final chapters of Phoenix, which were never released.

==Biography==
===Early life (1928–1945)===
Tezuka was the eldest of three children in Toyonaka, Osaka Toyonaka City, Osaka Prefecture Osaka.{{Sfn   Patten   2004   p = 145}}<ref name="Otaku Encyclopedia">{{cite book   last = Galbraith   first=Patrick W. title=The Otaku Encyclopedia: An Insiders Guide to the Subculture of Cool Japan  publisher = Kodansha International year=2009 pages=220–21 isbn = 978-4-7700-3101-3}}</ref> His nickname was gashagasha-atama (gashagasha is slang for messy, atama means head). Later in life, he gave his mother credit for inspiring confidence and creativity through her stories. She frequently took him to the Takarazuka Grand Theater Takarazuka Theatre, which often headlined the Takarazuka Revue, an all-female musical theater troupe. Their romantic musicals aimed at a female audience, had a large influence of Tezukas later works, including his costume designs. Not only that, but the large, sparkling eyes also had an influence on Tezukas art style.<ref>[http://www.legacy.com/news/celebrity-deaths/article/osamu-tezuka-god-of-manga] {{dead link date=August 2018}}</ref> He has said that he has a profound "spirit of nostalgia" for Takarazuka.<ref name="Gravett p.77">{{cite book  last =Gravett   first = Paul authorlink=Paul Gravett year=2004 title= Manga: 60 Years of Japanese Comics publisher=Harper Design isbn = 1-85669-391-0   page= 77}}</ref> When Tezuka was young, his father showed him Disney films; he became obsessed with the films and began to replicate them. He also became a Disney movie buff, seeing the films multiple times in a row, most famously seeing Bambi more than 80 times.<ref>{{cite news url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2007/08/19/books/book-reviews/osamu-tezuka-fighting-for-peace-with-the-mighty-atom/#.WeJp3VtSy2w title=Osamu Tezuka: Fighting for peace with the Mighty Atom date= August 19, 2007}}</ref> Tezuka started to draw comics around his second year of elementary school, drawing so much that his mother would have to erase pages in his notebook in order to keep up with his output. Tezuka was also inspired by works by Tagawa Hosui and Umino Junzo.<ref name="tezukaosamu.net">{{cite web url=https://tezukaosamu.net/en/about/1930.html title=1930s：History：ABOUT TEZUKA OSAMU：TezukaOsamu.net(EN) website=Tezukaosamu.net accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> Around his fifth year he found a bug named "Ground beetle Osamushi".

In 1945, Tezuka was accepted into Osaka University and began studying medicine. During this time, he also began publishing his first professional works.<ref>{{cite web url=https://tezukaosamu.net/en/about/1940.html title=1940s：History：ABOUT TEZUKA OSAMU：TezukaOsamu.net(EN) website=Tezukaosamu.net accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref>

===Publishing career and early success (1946–1952)===

Tezuka came to the realization that he could use manga as a means of helping to convince people to care for the world. After World War II, at age 17, he published his first piece of work: Diary of Ma-chan. Tezuka began talks with fellow manga artist Shichima Sakai, who had pitched Tezuka a manga based around the famous story Treasure Island. Sakai promised Tezuka a publishing spot from Ikuei Shuppan if he would work on the manga. Tezuka finished the manga, only loosely basing it on the original work.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.tcj.com/tezuka-osamu-outwits-the-phantom-blot-the-case-of-new-treasure-island-contd/2/ title=Tezuka Osamu Outwits the Phantom Blot: The Case of New Treasure Island cont’d - The Comics Journal - Page 2 website=Tcj.com accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> Shin Takarajima (New Treasure Island) was published and became an overnight success which began the golden age of manga, a craze comparable to American comic books at the time.<ref>{{cite news  url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article4723984.ece   work=The Times   location=London   title= Osamu Tezuka the master of mighty manga   first=Dominic   last=Wells   date = 2008-09-13   accessdate= 2010-05-20}}</ref>

In 1951, Tezuka joined a group known as Tokyo Children Manga Association consisting of other manga artists such as Baba Noboru, Ota Jiro, Furusawa Hideo, Fukui Eiichi, Irie Shigeru, and Negishi Komichi.<ref>{{cite web url=https://tezukaosamu.net/en/about/1950.html title=1950s：History：ABOUT TEZUKA OSAMU：TezukaOsamu.net(EN) website=Tezukaosamu.net accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref>

With the success of New Treasure Island, Tezuka traveled to Tokyo in search of a publisher for more of his work. After visiting Kobunsha Tezuka was turned down. However, publisher Shinseikaku agreed to purchase The Strange Voyage of Dr. Tiger and Domei Shuppansha would purchase The Mysterious Dr. Koronko. Whilst continuing his study in medical school Tezuka published his first masterpieces: a trilogy of science fiction epics called Lost World (manga) Lost World, Metropolis (manga) Metropolis and Next World (manga) Next World.

Soon after Tezuka published his first major success Jungle Emperor Leo, it was serialized in Manga Shonen from 1950 to 1954.<ref>{{cite web url=http://tezukaosamu.net/en/manga/186.html title=Jungle Emperor Leo : Manga : TezukaOsamu.net(EN) website=Tezukaosamu.net accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> In 1951 Tezuka graduated from the Osaka School of Medicine<ref>{{cite web url=http://tezukaosamu.net/en/about/1950.html title=1950s：History：ABOUT TEZUKA OSAMU：TezukaOsamu.net(EN) website=Tezukaosamu.net accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> and published Ambassador Atom, the first appearance of the Astro Boy character.

===Astro Boy, national fame and early animation (1952–1960)===

By 1952, Ambassador Atom proved to be only a mild success in Japan; however, one particular character became extremely popular with young boys: a humanoid robot named Atom.{{Sfn   Schodt   2007   p =4}} Tezuka received several letters from many young boys.{{Sfn   Schodt   2007   p=20}}Expecting success with a series based around Atom, Tezukas producer suggested that he be given human emotions.{{Sfn   Schodt   2007   p=21}} One day while working at a hospital Tezuka was punched in the face by a frustrated American G.I.

The character Atom and his adventures became an instant phenomenon in Japan.

Due to the success of Tetsuwan Atom, in 1953 Tezuka published the first Shōjo manga shōjo manga Ribon no Kishi (Princess Knight), serialized in Shojo Club from 1953 to 1956.<ref>{{cite web url=http://tezukaosamu.net/en/manga/559.html title=Princess Knight [Shojo Club <Girls Comic>] : Manga : TezukaOsamu.net(EN) website=Tezukaosamu.net accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref>

In 1954 Tezuka first published what he would consider his lifes work, Phoenix, which originally appeared in Mushi Production Commercial Firm.<ref>{{cite web url=http://tezukaosamu.net/en/manga/403.html title=The Phoenix (Chapter of Dawn)[COM Magazine] : Manga : TezukaOsamu.net(EN) website=Tezukaosamu.net accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> In 1958 Tezuka was asked by Toei Animation if his manga Son-Goku The Monkey could be adapted into an animation. It was widely reported that Tezuka worked as a director on the film, though Tezuka himself denied working on it.{{citation needed date=October 2017}} He was only involved in its promotion, which later sparked his interest in the animation industry.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.5/articles/patten1.5.html title=A Capsule History of Anime website=Awn.com accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> The film was released as Alakazam the Great in 1960.

===Production Career (1961-1989)===
In 1961, Tezuka entered the animation industry in Japan by founding the production company Mushi Productions as a rivalry with Toei Animation. He first began innovating the industry with the broadcast of the animated version of Astro Boy (1963 TV series) Astro Boy in 1963; this series would create the first successful model for animation production in Japan and would also be the first Japanese animation dubbed into English for an American audience. Other series were subsequently translated to animation, including Jungle Emperor, the first Japanese animated series produced in full color.<ref>{{cite web url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/6233/kimba-boxed-set/ title=Kimba Boxed Set website=DVD Talk accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> In 1967, in response to the magazine Garo and the gekiga, Tezuka created the magazine COM (manga magazine) COM.<ref>{{cite web url=http://neuviemeart.citebd.org/spip.php?article239 title=garo, magazine rebelle website=Neuviemeart.citebd.org accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> Tezuka stepped down as acting director in 1968 to found a new animation studio, Tezuka Productions, and continued experimenting with animation late into his life. In 1973, Mushi Productions collapsed financially and the fallout would produce several influential animation production studios including Sunrise (company) Sunrise.

=== Death and legacy ===
Tezuka died of stomach cancer on 9 February 1989 in Tokyo.<ref name="Patten2004">{{Harvnb   Patten   2004   p = 198}}</ref> His last words were: "Im begging you, let me work!", spoken to a nurse who had tried to take away his drawing equipment.<ref name="hinotori">Takayuki Matsutani (date unknown).

The city of Takarazuka, Hyōgo, where Tezuka grew up, opened a museum in his memory.<ref name="Otaku Encyclopedia" /> Stamps were issued in his honor in 1997. Also, beginning in 2003, the Japanese toy company Kaiyodo began manufacturing a series of figurines of Tezukas creations, including Princess Knight, Unico, the Phoenix, Dororo, Marvelous Melmo, Ambassador Magma, and many others. To date, three series of the figurines have been released.

His legacy has continued to be honored among manga artists and animators. Artists such as Akira Toriyama (Dr. Slump and Dragon Ball)<ref name="SJ interview">{{cite web  title=Shonen Jump interview  url=http://www.myfavoritegames.com/dragonball-z/Info/Interviews/Interviews-AkiraToriyama.htm  work= My favorite games   accessdate =2013-03-25}}</ref> have cited Tezuka as inspiration for their works.

From 2003 to 2009, Naoki Urasawa and Takashi Nagasaki adapted an arc of Astro Boy into the murder mystery series Pluto (manga) Pluto.<ref name="Pluto">{{cite web url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2012-09-13   work = Jason Thompsons House of 1000 Manga   title = Pluto date = 2012-09-13   publisher = Anime News Network accessdate = 2014-01-05}}</ref>

Tezuka was a personal friend (and apparent artistic influence) of Brazilian comic book artist Mauricio de Sousa. In 2012, Maurício published a two-issue story arc in the Monica Teen comic book featuring some of Tezukas main characters, such as Astro Boy, Black Jack, Sapphire, and Kimba, joining Monica and her friends in an adventure in the Amazon rainforest against a smuggling organization chopping down hundreds of trees. This was the first time that Tezuka Productions has allowed overseas artists to use Tezukas characters.<ref>{{cite web   first = Ari   last = Hirayama   url = http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/AJ201202010008   title = Brazilian cartoonist to publish manga with Osamu Tezuka   work = Asahi Shimbun   date = February 1, 2012   accessdate = February 28, 2012   deadurl = yes   archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130729085553/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/AJ201202010008   archivedate = July 29, 2013   df =  }}</ref>

Tezuka was a fan of Superman and was made honorary chairman of the Superman Fan Club in Japan.<ref name="About Osamu Tezuka">{{cite web url=http://www.tezukaosamu.net/en/about/1980.html title=About Tezuka Osamu work=www.tezukaosamu.net accessdate=2015-05-20}}</ref> In 1959 Tezuka married Etsuko Okada at a Takarazuka Hotel.

As a child, Tezukas arms swelled up and he became ill. He was treated and cured by a doctor, which made him want to be a doctor. At a crossing point, he asked his mother whether he should look into doing manga full-time or whether he should become a doctor. At the time, being a manga author was not a particularly rewarding job. The answer his mother gave was: "You should work doing the thing you like most of all." Tezuka decided to devote himself to manga creation on a full-time basis. He graduated from Osaka University and obtained his medical degree, but he would later use his medical and scientific knowledge to enrich his sci-fi manga, such as Black Jack (manga) Black Jack.<ref name="TezukaStory" /><ref name="Hanabatake">{{cite web url=http://www.hanabatake.com/research/tezuka.htm#_ednref11 title=Tezuka: God of Comics last=Santiago first=Ardith publisher=Hanabatake accessdate=2007-07-18 archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716014936/http://www.hanabatake.com/research/tezuka.htm#_ednref11 archivedate=2007-07-16}}</ref>

Although flattered by Kubricks invitation, Tezuka could not afford to leave his studio for a year to live in England, so he had to turn it down. Although he could not work on it, he loved the film, and would play its soundtrack at maximum volume in his studio to keep him awake during long nights of work.<ref>{{cite web   title = Osamu Star Annals: 1960s   work =Tezuka Osamu @ World   publisher = Tezuka Productions   url = http://en.tezuka.co.jp/osamu/annals/1960.html   accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web   title = Tezuka Osamu   publisher = Japan Zone   url = http://www.japan-zone.com/modern/tezuka_osamu.shtml   accessdate = 2007-08-11}}</ref>

==Style==
Tezuka is known for his imaginative stories and stylized Japanese adaptations of western literature. Tezukas "cinematic" page layouts was influenced by Milt Gross early graphic novel He Done Her Wrong.
