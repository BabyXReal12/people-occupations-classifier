==Friends==
Keane had a close friendship with humorist, newspaper columnist Erma Bombeck. Keane provided illustrations for Bombecks book Just Wait Until You Have Children of Your Own! (1972), and considered himself instrumental in convincing Bombeck and her family to move to Arizona near his home.<ref>{{cite web url=http://www.americancatholic.org/messenger/nov2001/feature1.asp title=Bil Keanes Family Circus - November 2001 Issue of St. Anthony Messenger Magazine Online work=americancatholic.org}}</ref> In 1996, he was a pall bearer at Bombecks funeral.<ref>{{cite web url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=894&dat=19960430&id=qxoOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iH0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4413,3938211 title=The Daily Courier - Google News Archive Search work=google.com}}</ref>

Stephan Pastis, creator of Pearls Before Swine (comic strip) Pearls Before Swine, acknowledged he was good friends with Keane and Keanes son, Jeff.<ref>Stephan Pastis, [http://stephanpastis.wordpress.com/2009/07/28/and-now-a-few-words-from-the-creator-of-one-of-the-worlds-most-beloved-family-friendly-comics/ "And Now a Few Words From the Creator of One of the World’s Most Beloved Family Comics"], Official Pearls Before Swine Blog, stephanpastis.wordpress.com, 28, July 2009</ref> Pastis has notably parodied The Family Circus in his own strip a number of times, and Keane wrote a satirical "attack" on these jokes as a foreword for Pastis Pearls collection List of Pearls Before Swine books Macho Macho Animals.<ref>Stephan Pastis, Pearls Sells Out: A Pearls Before Swine Treasury, Andrews McMeel Publishing (18 Aug 2009), p.13</ref>

He was also a great guy. I was a big fan."<ref>{{cite news   url=http://www.tcj.com/a-ringmaster-dies-bil-keane-1922-2011/   title=A Ringmaster Dies Bil Keane 1922-2011   first=R.C.   last=Harvey   newspaper=The Comics Journal   date=November 16, 2011   accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref>

Keane also counted fellow cartoonists Charles M. Schulz (Peanuts) and Mell Lazarus (Miss Peach, Momma) as close friends.<ref>{{cite news   title=‘Family Circus’ creator Bil Keane dies at 89   url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/nov/9/family-circus-creator-bil-keane-dies-at-89/   publisher=The Washington Times   date=November 9, 2011   last=Myers   first=Amanda Lee   accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news   title= ‘Lio’s’ artful Bil Keane tribute   url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/cartoon-of-the-day-lios-artful-bil-keane-tribute/2011/11/21/gIQAwATojN_blog.html   first=Michael   last=Cavna   newspaper=The Washington Post   date=November 21, 2012   accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref>

In 1994 the characters from The Family Circus made a "guest appearance" in Bill Griffiths Zippy the Pinhead comic strip. Griffith sad, "I remembered Bil’s affection for Zippy, so I decided to bite the bullet and call him to ask if, instead of me parodying his strip, he’d agree to jam with me..."<ref>{{cite news   first=Bill   last=Griffith   title=Bil Keane: An Appreciation    newspaper=The Comics Journal   date=November 14, 2011   url=http://www.tcj.com/bil-keane-an-appreciation/   accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref> The characters were drawn into the strip by Keane, but the dialog was written by Griffith. Then, on March 7, 1995, Zippy made an appearance in a Family Circus panel, drawn in by Bill Griffith. Griffith said Family Circus was "the last remaining folk art strip."<ref>{{cite news   title=Historically Speaking: ‘Family Circus’ cartoonist respected by his peers   url=http://www.norwichbulletin.com/newsnow/x1112597999/Historically-Speaking-Family-Circus-cartoonist-respected-by-his-peers#axzz2CLt2kL6A   first=Richard   last=Curland   newspaper=Norwich Bulletin   date=December 3, 2011   accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref> Griffith said, "Its supposed to be the epitome of squareness, but it turns the corner into a hip zone."<ref>{{cite news   first=Pat   last=Seremet   title=Zippy and The Family Circus--Together again!!   newspaper=The Hartford Courant   date=July 11, 2002}}</ref>
