==Career==
After graduating from SVA, Telgemeier began attending small-press festivals such as the MoCCA Festival, selling self-published autobiographical stories and vignettes from her life.

Each was a twelve-page black-and-white comic.<ref name=Cosmopolitan /> Other early works include a short story in Bizarro World for DC Comics, and a short story in Volume 4 of the Flight (comic) Flight anthology.<ref name=Books />

In 2004, Telgemeier met an editor from Scholastic at an art gallery party who mentioned that Scholastic was planning to set up a graphic novel imprint (which later became Graphix). At that years San Diego Comic-Con, Telgemeier met that editors boss, who invited her to pitch an idea for Scholastic. When Telgemeier mentioned she had been a fan of Ann M. Martins The Baby-sitters Club series, they asked her to work up a graphic novel adaptation.<ref name=Cosmopolitan /> Scholastic/Graphix went on to publish four graphic novels in the series: Kristys Great Idea, The Truth About Stacey, Mary Anne Saves the Day, and Claudia and Mean Janine.<ref name=Books>{{Cite web url=http://goraina.com/books/ title=Books by Raina  website=goraina.com access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref> The advances for the adaptations allowed Telgemeier to quit her full-time job and concentrate on her art, and she completed the fourth novel in 2008.<ref name=Cosmopolitan />

At the same time, Telgemeier was invited to join Girlamatic, a subscription-based webcomics site with an emphasis on stories for young women.
