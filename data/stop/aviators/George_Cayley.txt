1799 forth concept modern aeroplane fixedwing aircraft fixedwing flying machine separate systems lift propulsion control
pioneer aeronautical engineering sometimes referred father aviation
discovered identified four forces heavierthanair flying vehicle weight lift force lift drag physics drag thrust
modern aeroplane design based discoveries importance camber aerodynamics cambered wings also identified cayley
constructed first flying model aeroplane also diagrammed elements vertical flight
designed first glider reliably reported carry human aloft correctly predicted sustained flight would occur lightweight engine developed provide adequate thrust lift
wright brothers acknowledged importance development aviation
