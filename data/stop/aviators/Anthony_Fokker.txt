author weyl fokker creative years putnam 1965 says fokker talented bold pilot business character flawed failed reinvest profits back factory consequentially struggled fulfill contracts factory floor often muddled prototype development production taking place time fokker distrusted qualified engineers resented frequent german insistence carrying stringent structural tests ensure prototype aircraft combat could tempered insensitive verbally abused dying designer martin kreuzer evening june 1916 kreuzer crashed prototype fokker rudder jammed kreuzer able give verbal report accident died fokker hurried scene shouted reproaches mortally injured weyl says incident witnessed reinhold platz succeeded kreuzer

weyls biography paints unpleasant picture fokker businessman popular charismatic figure service pilots could charm even senior officers charm enabled deal first major crisis german career newly delivered fokker triplanes began experience sudden fatal accidents late 1917 type temporarily grounded dangerous triplanes wings frequently ripped aerobatic conditions even lothar richthofen brother manfred lucky survive crash fokker able prove german high command basic design fault german military inquiry concluded shoddy workmanship poor supervision quality control fokker factory blame fokker received stern warning future conduct unfortunately scenario repeated months later introduction evdviii monoplane mid1918 high level german inquiry revealed production workmanship issues weyl asserts german authorities willing file criminal charges fokker might done returned netherlands shortly world

fokkers account dviii places blame officious german force inspectors requiring illconceived design change first d8sic submitted engineering division sandload tested wings proved sufficiently strong regulations called proportionate strength rear spar compared front spar complying governments edict strengthened rear spar started produce quantity

weyl also discusses claims fokkers outright plagiarism taking sole credit work staff first designer martin kreuzer later reinhold platz example contemporary german documents evdviii refer fokker designer weyl authors suggest platz real design genius behind dvii dviii truth platz recalled weyl attended high level meetings alongside fokker never introduced referredto designer often never even spoke fokker fled germany platz immediately took german works fokkers behalf fokker later moved platz netherlands head designer postwar german operation collapsed indicates platz really play greater design role fokker admits weyl uncharitably suggests platzs role fokker dviii crisis meetings take blame anything wrong receive credit much interpretation based fact platz still alive tell side story 1965 fokker unclear

another book henri hegener knew fokker platz personally depicts rather different story saying platz skilled craftsman excellent welder received formal technical training contributions fokker designs exaggerated although hegener grants platz good rule thumb designer hegener also contradicts claims platz treated badly fokker least financially platzs yearend bonuses often exceeded yearly salary
