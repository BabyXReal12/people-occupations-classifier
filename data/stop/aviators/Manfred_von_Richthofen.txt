theories last combat
richthofen highly experienced skilled fighter pilot—fully aware risk ground fire concurred rules fighting created late mentor boelcke specifically advised pilots take unnecessary risks context richthofens judgement last combat clearly unsound several respects
several theories proposed account behaviour

1999 german medical researcher henning allmers published article british medical journal lancet suggesting likely brain damage head wound richthofen suffered july 1917 woundedincombat played part barons death supported 2004 paper researchers university texasaustin university texas richthofens behaviour injury noted consistent traumatic brain injury braininjured patients injury could account perceived lack judgement final flight flying enemy territory suffering target fixation
richthofen suffering combat stress reaction cumulative combat stress made fail observe usual precautions leading british aces major edward mannock edward mick mannock killed ground fire july 1918 crossing lines level action always cautioned younger pilots popular french aces georges guynemer went missing september 1917 probably attacking twoseater without realizing several fokkers escorting
suggestion richthofens death prevailing wind easterly rather usual convert abbron westerly meant richthofen heading generally westward airspeed travelling ground rather typical ground speed considerably faster normal could easily strayed enemy lines without realizing
time richthofens death front highly fluid state following initial success spring offensive german offensive march–april 1918 part germanys last opportunity face allied superiority german service difficulty acquiring vital reconnaissance information could little prevent allied squadrons completing effective reconnaissance close support armies
