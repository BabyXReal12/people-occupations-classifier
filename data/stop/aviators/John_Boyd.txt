foundation theories

destruction creation boyd attempts provide philosophy philosophical foundation theory theories warfare integrates kurt gödel gödels gödels incompleteness theorem incompleteness theorem werner heisenberg heisenbergs uncertainty principle second thermodynamics provide context rationale development ooda loop

boyd inferred following theories
gödels incompleteness theorems gödels incompleteness theorem logical model reality incomplete possibly inconsistent must continuously refinedadapted face observations
uncertainty principle heisenbergs uncertainty principle limit ability observe reality precision
second thermodynamics second thermodynamics entropy closed system always tends increase thus nature given system continuously changing even efforts directed toward maintaining original form

considerations boyd concluded maintain accurate effective grasp reality must undergo continuous cycle interaction environment geared assessing constant changes boyd though hardly first expanded charles darwin darwins theory evolution suggesting natural selection applies biological also social contexts survival nations businesses free market competition integrating concepts stated decision cycle central mechanism adaptation social context increasing ones rate accuracy assessment visavis ones counterparts rate accuracy assessment provides substantial advantage forms competition survival autonomy ability adapt change perfect adaptation existing circumstances indeed boyd noted radical uncertainty necessary precondition physical mental vitality opportunities ideas spring mismatch reality ideas examples history science engineering business illustrate

elements warfare
boyd divided warfare three distinct elements
morale warfare destruction enemys disruption alliances potential allies induction internal fragmentation ideally resulting dissolution moral bonds permit organic whole organization exist breaking mutual trust common outlook mentioned paragraph
mental warfare distortion enemys perception reality disinformation ambiguous posturing andor severing communicationinformation infrastructure
