military theories
early 1960s boyd together thomas christie thomas christie civilian mathematician created energymaneuverability theory theory aerial combat legendary wiktmaverick maverick reputation boyd said stolen computer time millions calculations necessary prove theory
though later audit found computer time facility properly billed recognized projects irregularity could prosecuted theory became world standard design fighter aircraft time forces project subsequently mcdonnell douglas eagle floundering boyds deployment orders vietnam canceled brought pentagon redo tradeoff studies according work helped save project costly even though final product larger heavier desired however cancellation tour vietnam meant boyd would important airtoair combat strategists combat kills flown missions last months korean 1950–1953 wingman

colonel everest riccioni pierre sprey boyd formed small advocacy group within headquarters usaf dubbed fighter mafia
riccioni force fighter pilot assigned staff position research development sprey civilian statistician working systems analysis assigned working beginnings called blue bird time boyd disagreed direction program going proposed alternative bird concept clear weather airtoair fighter speed mach rather blue birds mach speed would sacrificed favor lower weight therefore better maneuverability lower cost boyd sprey also argued active radar radarguided missiles proposed concept staff changes blue bird
secretary defense attracted idea cost fighter gave funding riccioni study project lightweight fighter program became force went ahead program stipulating design cost basis million copy aircraft usaf considered idea hilo force structure expanded program program soon went fighter mafias vision strippeddown airtoair specialist envisioned heavier multirole fighterbomber advanced avionics active radar radarguided missiles
harry hillaker designer remarked would designed plane differently known would become multimission aircraft
boyd credited largely developing strategy invasion iraq gulf 1991 1981 boyd presented briefing patterns conflict richard cheney dick cheney member united states house representatives
1990 boyd moved florida declining health cheney secretary defense george bush administration called back work plans operation desert storm
boyd substantial influence ultimate left hook design plan
letter editor inside pentagon former commandant marine corps general charles krulak quoted saying iraqi army collapsed morally intellectually onslaught american coalition forces john boyd architect victory surely commanded fighter wing force unit wing maneuver division military division desert
ooda loop
main ooda loop
fileoodaboydsvg thumb right
boyds concept decision cycle ooda loop process entity either individual organization reacts event according idea victory able create situations wherein make appropriate decisions quickly ones opponent construct originally theory achieving success airtoair combat developed boyds energymaneuverability theory observations combat mikoyangurevich mig15 mig15s north american sabres korea harry hillaker chief designer said ooda theory time dominant parameter pilot goes ooda cycle shortest time prevails opponent caught responding situations already changed
filejohnboyd pilotjpg thumb right john boyd korean
boyd hypothesized intelligent organisms organizations undergo continuous cycle interaction environment boyd breaks cycle four interrelated overlapping processes cycles continuously

observation collection data means senses
orientation analysis synthesis data form ones current mind mental perspective
decision determination course action based ones current mental perspective
action physical playingout decisions

course taking place situation changing sometimes necessary cancel planned action order meet changes decision cycle thus known ooda loop boyd emphasized decision cycle central mechanism enabling adaptation apart natural selection therefore critical survival

boyd theorized large organizations corporations governments militaries possessed hierarchy ooda loops military tactics tactical grandtactical operational strategic levels addition stated effective organizations highly decentralized chain command utilizes objectivedriven orders directive control rather methoddriven orders order harness mental capacity creative abilities individual commanders level 2003 power edge concept took form publication power edge command control information david alberts richard hayes boyd argued structure creates flexible organic whole quicker adapt rapidly changing situations noted however highly decentralized organization would necessitate high degree mutual trust common outlook came prior shared experiences headquarters needs know troops perfectly capable forming good plan taking specific objective troops need know headquarters direct achieve certain objectives without good reason

2007 strategy writer robert greene author robert greene discussed loop post called ooda
insisted deeply relevant kind competitive environment business politics sports even struggle organisms survive claimed initially struck brilliance

ooda loop since used core theory litigation strategy litigation strategy unifies cognitive science game theory shape actions witnesses opposing counsel
aerial attack study
boyd also served revolutionize airtoair combat author aerial attack study aerial attack study became official tactics manual fighter aircraft boyd changed pilots thought prior tactics manual pilots thought airtoair combat complex ever fully understood release boyd’s aerial attack study pilots realized highstakes death dance aerial combat solved
boyd said pilot going aerial combat must know things position enemy velocity enemy given velocity enemy pilot able decide enemy capable pilot knows maneuvers enemy perform decide counter pilot’s actions aerial attack study contained everything fighter pilot needed know
overwhelming belief force airtoair combat thing past boyd proved much alive force moving away aerial combat development missilescitation needed reasonthe claim force believe dogfighting needs authoritative source datejanuary 2017 boyd proved aerial attack study dogfight dead showing fighter pilots could outmaneuver missiles john boyd’s aerial attack study revolutionary first instance history tactics reduced objective state
boyd’s manual proved undisputed master area aerial combat within decade aerial attack study became text forces around world

foundation theories
boyd never wrote book military strategy central works encompassing theories warfare consist severalhundredslide presentation entitled discourse winning losing short essay entitled destruction creation 1976
destruction creation boyd attempts provide philosophy philosophical foundation theory theories warfare integrates kurt gödel gödels gödels incompleteness theorem incompleteness theorem werner heisenberg heisenbergs uncertainty principle second thermodynamics provide context rationale development ooda loop

boyd inferred following theories
gödels incompleteness theorems gödels incompleteness theorem logical model reality incomplete possibly inconsistent must continuously refinedadapted face observations
uncertainty principle heisenbergs uncertainty principle limit ability observe reality precision
second thermodynamics second thermodynamics entropy closed system always tends increase thus nature given system continuously changing even efforts directed toward maintaining original form

considerations boyd concluded maintain accurate effective grasp reality must undergo continuous cycle interaction environment geared assessing constant changes boyd though hardly first expanded charles darwin darwins theory evolution suggesting natural selection applies biological also social contexts survival nations businesses free market competition integrating concepts stated decision cycle central mechanism adaptation social context increasing ones rate accuracy assessment visavis ones counterparts rate accuracy assessment provides substantial advantage forms competition survival autonomy ability adapt change perfect adaptation existing circumstances indeed boyd noted radical uncertainty necessary precondition physical mental vitality opportunities ideas spring mismatch reality ideas examples history science engineering business illustrate

elements warfare
boyd divided warfare three distinct elements
morale warfare destruction enemys disruption alliances potential allies induction internal fragmentation ideally resulting dissolution moral bonds permit organic whole organization exist breaking mutual trust common outlook mentioned paragraph
mental warfare distortion enemys perception reality disinformation ambiguous posturing andor severing communicationinformation infrastructure
physical warfare abilities physical resources weapons people logistical assets

military reform
john boyds briefing patterns conflict provided theoretical foundation defense reform movement 1970s 1980s prominent members movement included pierre sprey franklin spinney william lind william lind assistant secretary defense operational testing evaluation thomas christie congressman newt gingrich senator gary hart military reform movement fought believed unnecessarily complex expensive weapons systems officer corps focused careerist standard overreliance attrition warfare another reformer james burton disputed army test safety bradley fighting vehicle james fallows contributed debate article atlantic monthly titled musclebound superpower book national defense today younger reformers continue boyds work foundation evolving theories strategy management leadership

boyd gave testimony congress status military reform operation desert storm
maneuver warfare marines
january 1980 boyd gave briefing patterns conflict marines amphibious warfare school instructor time michael wyly boyd changing curriculum blessing general trainor trainor later asked wyly write tactics manual marines
john schmitt guided general alfred gray wrote warfighting writing collaborated john boyd wyly lind junior officers credited developing concepts would become marine model maneuver warfare
