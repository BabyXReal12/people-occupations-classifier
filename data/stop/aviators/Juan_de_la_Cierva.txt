gyroplane autogyro
cierva started building aircraft early 1912 1919 started consider helicopter rotor rotor generate lift airspeed eliminate risk stall

order achieve utilised ability lifting rotor autorotation helicopter autorotate whereby suitable pitch setting rotor continue rotate without mechanical drive sustained torque equilibrium lift drag forces acting blades phenomenon already knownrefhttpwwwcentennialofflightnetessayrotaryearly20thcenturyhe2htmref available safety feature allow controlled descent helicopter event engine failure ciervas autogyro rotor drawn means conventional propeller aircraft propeller result rotor generated sufficient lift sustain level flight climb descent

could satisfactorily achieved cierva experienced several failures primarily associated unbalanced rolling movement generated attempting takeoff dissymmetry lift advancing retreating blades major difficulty resolved introduction flapping hinge 1923 ciervas first successful autogyro flown spain gomez spencer

pioneering work carried ciervas native spain 1925 brought cierva britain demonstrated ministry farnborough hampshire machine four blade rotor flapping hinges relied upon conventional airplane controls pitch roll based upon avro 504k fuselage initial rotation rotor achieved rapid uncoiling rope passed around stops undersides blades

farnborough demonstration great success resulted invitation continue work direct result assistance scottish industrialist james weir cierva autogiro company formed following year outset cierva concentrated upon design manufacture rotor systems relying established aircraft manufacturers produce airframes predominantly avro company

avro built cierva refinement powerful armstrong siddeley lynx 180hp lynx radial engine several built incorporated drag hinges blade flapping motion causing high blade root stresses rotor plane rotation modification however resulted problems ground resonance drag hinge dampers fitted

resolution fundamental rotor problems opened progress confidence built rapidly several crosscountry flights c8l4 entered 1928 kings race kings race although forced withdraw c8l4 subsequently completed convert 4800 abbron tour british isles later year flew london paris thus becoming first rotating wing aircraft cross english channel tour subsequently extended include berlin brussels amsterdam

predominant problem autogyro driving rotor prior takeoff several methods attempted addition coiled rope system could take rotor speed required point movement along ground reach flying speed necessary tilting rotor establish autorotation

another approach tilt tail stabiliser deflect engine slipstream rotor acceptable solution finally achieved cierva produced quantities direct drive engine rotor fitted rotor could accelerated speed system declutched prior executing takeoff

ciervas autogyros achieved success acceptance others began follow came innovation important development direct rotor control cyclic pitch variation achieved initially tilting rotor subsequently raoul hafner application spider mechanism acted directly rotor blade first production direct control autogyro cierva produced quantity avro liore olivier fockewulf development cyclic pitch variation also influenced dutch helicopter pioneer albert gillis baumhauer adopted swashplate principle designs probably influenced cierva meeting 1928ref namevoogtalex voogt transmission helicopter technology 1920‐1939 exchanges baumhauer history tech january 2013 119–40 httpswwwacademiaedu2543089 extractref

ciervas motivation produce aircraft would stall near life accepted advantages offered helicopter began initial work towards 1936 cierva autogiro company responded british ministry specification royal navy helicopter gyrodyne perhaps ironic twist fate cierva airliner accident croydon

legacy
cierva’s work rotor dynamics control made possible modern helicopter whose development practical means flight prevented problems understanding established applicable rotorwinged aircraft
