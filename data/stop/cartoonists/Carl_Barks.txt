ride tall ships away

walk fabled people trod
yetis trod snow

meet folks live stars
find much like
food love happiness
things discuss

world full clans cults
abuzz angry bees
junior woodchucks snapping jeers
littlest chickadees

ducks show part life
forgive slight
black eyes given revenge
keep hatred burning bright

walks shade
pass graveyards filled wars
nice stop read ducks
whose battles leave scars

read ducks parody
vain attempts glory
dont exist somehow leave
